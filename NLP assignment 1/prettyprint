# Usage: prettyprint [files]
#
# Quick and dirty prettyprinter for LISP-like expressions.
# Prettyprints all the input, except lines that start with # (i.e., comments).
# No assumption about input whitespace except that it separates sister atoms.

#         2001-09-08: Created for 600.465 HW1.
#         2001-10-20: Modified for 600.465 HW3 to allow first list element
#                     to be a list itself.  Not sure why - maybe to accept
#                     the output of the simplify script?
#         2002-06-28: Modified original so it could be used as an interactive
#                     filter rather than reading a whole file before printing
#                     anything.
#         2002-10-24: Merged the two previous modifications.
#         2003-10-21: Skip comment lines.
#         2011-08-31: Instead, pass comment lines (and blank lines) through
#                     as soon as possible.
#         2011-08-31: Start the 'die' messages on a new line.
#
# TO DO: Perhaps when the indent level is 0, we should preserve whitespace
#        (or perhaps even all lines that don't start with \s\*\(, even if
#        they contain parens).

sub pp {    # prettyprints expressions from @tokens,
            # at the indent level given by the argument,
            # until it runs out of input or runs into an extra right paren.

  # Note that there's some special handling at indentation level 0.
  # This was added ONLY to improve our printing of comment lines.
  #
  #    At level 0, we want to pass comment lines through immediately rather
  #    than waiting for the next newline.  This enables us to print comments
  #    before the first expression (i.e., before the first newline).  It
  #    also lets us print comments "hot" as they arrive between expressions 
  #    1 and 2, rather than waiting till expression 2 actually arrives.
  # 
  #    To make this work, we must print "\n" AFTER each level-0
  #    expression.  I used to treat level 0 in exactly the same way as
  #    the other levels (print "\n" BEFORE each expression other than
  #    the first, which required the main routine to print a final
  #    "\n" before quitting).  But I've modified the code so that we
  #    suppress "\n" before level-0 expressions and add it after them.
