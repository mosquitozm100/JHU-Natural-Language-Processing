SUBJECT: CHANGE OF DATE : &NAME &NAME Sorry - the date of the following seminar has been changed to the 22nd of October . Natural Language and Information Processing Group Seminar &NAME : The Interaction of Language Learning and Evolution Speaker : &NAME &NAME 12pm , Tuesday 22nd October Room GW22 , &NAME Laboratory , &NAME &NAME Building , &NAME &NAME Avenue &WEBSITE &NAME : I will describe some models of natural languages as dynamical systems ( linguistic variants are differentially inherited " through child language learning ) , in some cases with adaptation ( linguistic selection amongst variants , natural selection for better language learners ) . The " natural " in " natural language " is mainly a marker to distinguish the study of human languages from that of logics or programming languages . The distinction has been methodologically without much content as formal linguistics treats human language as a static well-formed stringset and employs similar tools -- formal language theory , denotational semantics -- to theoretical computer science . Most linguists would probably agree with &NAME &NAME 's famous dictum , " I reject the contention that an important theoretical difference exists between formal and natural languages " , because not to would appear to preclude the possibility of formal linguistics . However , this has meant that , the focus has been on the individual speaker and her idiolect , whilst the study of language change and variation has remained mostly descriptive and unsystematic . Dynamical systems , such as the weather , can be rule-governed , complex ( in the sense of unpredictable ) , but not adaptive . Others , such as the immune system , are adaptive and complex . Complexity can arise through constraints on variation as well as through competing selection pressures . Constraints on language variation are a consequence of the cognitive capacities and limitations of the language users -- just as the constraints of biochemistry places limitations on variation in biological organisms . If language is adaptive for its users , and linguistic selection pressures for greater learnability , expressiveness and interpretability are often in conflict , then ( co-evolutionary ) interactions are predicted , and the adaptive landscape will be complex with many local optima and no fixed attractors . Nevertheless , stochastic computational simulations of such models , can shed light on major theoretical linguistic issues , such as : are commonalities amongst the world 's languages necessarily a consequence of an innate language faculty ? ; under what conditions would such a faculty evolve ? ; or is language change a directional process ?

SUBJECT: &NUM &NAME &NAME : 5th November and 8th November Natural Language and Information Processing Group Seminar &WEBSITE / 12pm , Tuesday 5th November , &NAME &ORG , &NAME &NAME Building , &NAME &NAME Avenue &WEBSITE &NAME : Focusing Effects in &NAME Resolution : Computational Influences and &NAME &NAME Speaker : &NAME &NAME - &NAME University &NAME : &NAME research based on &NAME &NAME ( &NAME , &NAME , and &NAME , &NUM ) has reached the conclusion that an ambiguous pronoun is interpreted immediately as referring to the entity assumed to constitute the local discourse focus , even in the presence of prior semantic information that makes this interpretation implausible . This contrasts with other experimental research which supports the position that discourse focus exerts a weak influence on pronominal interpretation and is overridden by pragmatic plausibility considerations . Moreover , there is substantial experimental research demonstrating that , even though the processes of resolving a pronoun are initiated as soon as the pronoun is encountered , they are not brought to completion until much later , especially in the case of ambiguous pronouns . Such a result is hardly compatible with the assumption of immediacy of interpretation underlying Centering-motivated research . In this talk I will argue that the discrepancies between &NAME and other psycholinguistic research on focusing and pronominal resolution can be attributed to some extent to the fact that these approaches do not always share the same definition of focus ; that they employ different experimental paradigms ; and that perhaps they probe different aspects of the resolution process . Finally , I will briefly discuss the extent to which a computational model such as &NAME &NAME , which is based on distributional observations ( &NAME , &NUM ) , can adequately explain psychological processes in general . 12pm , Friday 8th November , &NAME &NAME &NAME , &NAME &NAME Building , &NAME &NAME Avenue &WEBSITE &NAME : A Lightweight Approach to &NAME &NAME and Conversational Natural Language Speaker : &NAME &NAME - &NAME &NAME &NAME : Many approaches to natural language processing require large dictionaries , large grammars or both .

While several medium- to large-scale treebanks exist for English and some other languages , pre-existing publicly available resources exhibit &NUM or more of the following limitations : ( &CHAR ) &NAME is monostratal , either encoding topological ( phrase structure ) or dependency information , ( ii ) the depth of linguistic information recorded is relatively shallow , ( iii ) the design and format of linguistic representation in the tree-bank hard-wires a small , predefined range of ways in which information can be extracted from the treebank , and ( iv ) representations in existing treebanks are static , creating challenges both for consistency during the development of a large-scale treebank , and for relevance over time as the field advances . &NAME &NAME aims at the development of a novel treebanking methodology , rich in nature and dynamic both in the ways linguistic data can be retrieved from the treebank in varying granularity and in the constant evolution and regular updating of the treebank itself . Since July &NUM , the project hsa been working to build the foundations for this new type of treebank , developing improved tools for treebank construction and maintenance , and constructing an initial set of &NUM , &NUM annotated trees hand-selected from the full set of analyses for each example produced by the &NAME English Resource Grammar ( &NAME ) . Both the tools and the data are distributed together with the &NAME system and the &NAME under an open-source license . In this talk I provide an overview of the Redwoods initiative , demonstrate the available tools , and report on the current results of the first update of the treebank to reflect improvements in the &NAME during the period from July &NUM to October &NUM . &NAME : &NAME &NAME , &NAME &NAME , &NAME &NAME , &NAME &NAME , &NAME &NAME , and &NAME &NAME ( All welcome - For instructions on how to get to the &ORG , please see : &WEBSITE )

SUBJECT: &NAME &NAME Tuesday 3rd December Natural Language and Information Processing Group Seminar &WEBSITE / &NAME : Automatic indexing and retrieval of crime-scene photographs : having recourse to Natural Language Processing Speaker : &NAME &NAME - &NAME University &NUM noon , Tuesday 3rd December , Room &NAME &ORG , &NAME &NAME Building , &NAME &NAME Avenue &WEBSITE &NAME : Current approaches in automatic text-based image indexing fail in capturi ng semantic information expressed in the captions , that is important for the subsequent retrieval of the images . The indexing and retrieval prototype developed within the Scene Of Crime Information System ( SOCIS ) project attempts to go beyond keyword-based approaches and methods that extract syntactic relations from captions . SOCIS relies on advanced Natural Language Processing techniques in order to extract relational facts from captions . These relational facts consist of a pragmatic relation '' and the entities this relation connects ( triples of the form : ARG1 - &NAME &NAME ) . In SOCIS , the triples are used as complex image indexing terms ; however , the extraction mechanism is used not only for indexing purposes but also for image retrieval . Extracting the corresponding relational structures from free - natural language queries , SOCIS attempts to match the query triples to the indexing triple &CHAR and retrieve the appropriate images with high precision and recall . We have implemented this approach for crime investigation , an application domain where efficient querying of large crime-scene photograph databases is of crucial importance . In this presentation , I will start with a demonstration of the current SO &NAME prototype and an overview of the application scenario and I will then focus on the &NAME techniques used for developing the prototype . The main extraction mechanism will be presented , as well as a preliminary retrieval mechanism ( the " query triples - indexing triples " matching mechanism ) .

The main extraction mechanism will be presented , as well as a preliminary retrieval mechanism ( the " query triples - indexing triples " matching mechanism ) .

SUBJECT: &NAME &NAME Tuesday 21st January Natural Language and Information Processing Group Seminar &WEBSITE / 12pm , Tuesday 21st January , &NAME &ORG , &NAME &NAME Building , &NAME &NAME Avenue &WEBSITE &NAME : Grammatical Relations , &NAME &NAME and Question Answering Speaker : &NAME &NAME - University of &NAME &NAME : In this talk , I will give an overview of my PhD thesis work on automatically finding grammatical relations to verbs in English . Grammatical relations ( &NAME ) , such as subject , direct object , temporal or locative adjunct , are interesting from a theoretical as well as from a practical point of view because they constitute a link between syntax and semantics . &NUM approach to finding &NAME is to have a parser construct a full parse of a sentence and to extract &NAME from the parse tree afterwards . By contrast , our relation finder directly extracts grammatical relations from part-of-speech tagged and chunked text . The relation finder is implemented through a supervised machine learning algorithm , viz . &NAME &NAME . I will briefly explain &NAME &NAME , show how I derived training and test material from the &NAME &NAME and give a summary of results . In the second part , I will show how &NAME can be used for open domain question answering ( QA ) on the &NAME . I will introduce the &NAME task and its evaluation , explain how I implemented a &NAME prototype and show examples of successes and failures .

SUBJECT: NL&IP Seminar Tuesday 28th January Natural Language and Information Processing Group Seminar &WEBSITE / 12pm , Tuesday 28th January , &NAME &ORG , &NAME &NAME Building , &NAME &NAME Avenue &WEBSITE &NAME : Document filtering : tasks , models and implementation Speaker : &NAME &NAME - &NAME Research &NAME : Much information retrieval research revolves around a canonical model of a search task : a user issuing a query to a ( temporarily static ) document collection , and being presented with a ranked list of documents ( with perhaps a feedback loop ) . This model informs many aspects of the work - - the kinds of theoretical approach taken , many implementation issues including the design of efficient , fast-response systems , the measurement of effectiveness and the qualitative testing of systems . However , we may take a number of different views of the information task itself and the user context in which that task occurs . &NUM alternative is represented by the filtering task , as defined for the &NAME exercise . Here filtering is seen as a content-based , adaptive task applied to an incoming stream of documents , involving user needs represented by profiles . In this talk , I will explore the nature of this task , and some of the ways in which it must be treated differently from the canonical model . I will address both conceptual and implementation issues , and discuss some experimental results from &NAME . ( All welcome - For instructions on how to get to the &ORG , please see : &WEBSITE )

Typical approaches based on information extraction technology will usually focus on shallow semantics such as named entities in order to build up a template view of part of the text but this approach suffers from not being able to offer the computer a deeper understanding of the mined information or allowing this deeper understanding to feed back and influence the tempate filling process . In order to increase portability of knowledge and to allow the text mining system to incorporate deeper semantic knowledge of concept classes , properties ( slots ) , relations and axioms we are developing a front-end environment which allows domain-experts to specify such knowledge cooperatively online in the form of an ontology . Once an ontology has been agreed , a representative set of texts can be annotated according to the specified classes and given to the information extraction system to learn from so that future texts in the domain can be automatically mined for similar facts . This talk introduces an overview of the system and also focuses in some detail on experiments we have recently done using support vector machines in extending the named entity task to domain-based terminology identification and classification for functional genomics .

SUBJECT: NL&IP Seminar Tuesday 25th &NAME Natural Language and Information Processing Group Seminar &WEBSITE / 12pm , Tuesday 25th &NAME , FW11 &ORG , &NAME &NAME Building , &NAME &NAME Avenue &WEBSITE &NAME : &NAME - A &NAME &NAME Approach to &NAME &NAME . Speaker : &NAME &NAME - &NAME University &NAME : &NAME is a type of figurative language where &NUM entity is used to refer to another related entity . A typical example is ( &NUM ) Does he drive a &NAME ? In ( &NUM ) , the name of a company " &NAME " is used to refer to a car produced by that company . Most traditional approaches to metonymy understanding rely on large amounts of world knowledge and are not easily scalable and / or portable . In the MASCARA project we explored supervised statistical classification methods as an alternative approach . We will present the following results : &NUM The regularity and productivity of metonymic readings make it possible to reduce metonymy understanding to a classification task comparable to classic word sense disambiguation for the large majority of metonymic readings . &NUM Grammatical argument-head relations are an appropriate feature for such a classification task and , in particular , more predictive for metonymy recognition than e.g. , collocations . &NUM Data sparseness in argument-head relations can be at least partially overcome by the integration of thesaurus information without increasing the size of the training data . &NUM We also explore the effect that parser accuracy has on the recognition algorithm and compare the difficulty of metonymy recognition to classic word sense disambiguation .

This talk focuses on the automatic induction of verb classes : a clustering methodology is developed which utilises the relationship between verb meaning components and verb behaviour to provide a classification of German verbs . In the first part of the talk , I describe the acquisition of lexical syntactic and semantic verb properties from an unsupervised trained statistical grammar model . The properties are used to define German verbs on &NUM levels of verb description , purely syntactic frame types , prepositional phrase information and selectional preferences . In the second part of the talk , I describe the adjustment of the standard clustering algorithm k-Means to the task of inducing semantic verb classes from the various verb descriptions . The clustering parameters , clustering evaluation and clustering results are interpreted and discussed . ( All welcome - For instructions on how to get to the &ORG , please see : &WEBSITE )

SUBJECT: lg1 practicals Hi , Just a friendly ( I hope ) message to say that we noticed you did n't have the tick for session one of the practicals yet . There 's no requirement to get a tick every week as long as you get them all by the end of term , so if this is just because you forgot , or the demonstrator was too busy , or whatever , then that 's fine .

SUBJECT: &NAME files All but one of the answer files are now in /usr / groups / mphil / qa03 / rmrs / ans - the missing &NUM files are &NUM , &NUM , &NUM and &NUM . If we can repair the problems we will add those files and let you know . Otherwise these are the final versions for this practical ( unless very serious bugs are reported ) . You may notice that the dates have changed on some of the files that you had before - these files should be otherwise identical to the versions you have been looking at . Although the old &NAME and &NAME files remain , please use the top_docs files instead . I have replaced ques-out-jan29.rmrs with a version which has &NUM structure for each of the &NUM sentences ( the older version had &NUM structures missing ) . There should be a &NUM mapping between the sentences in this file and the answer files , apart from the missing answer files mentioned above . Please let me know at once if you suspect that this is still not the case . I will attempt to answer all the outstanding questions that you have sent tonight or on Sunday if not .

SUBJECT: practicals &NUM ) the &NUM missing .rmrs files are now in the same directory as the others - there should be no further changes or additions &WEBSITE which contains lines of the form base &NAME &NAME ... derivedn where the base is always a verb ( because I 've only done things which can be taken to have a base verb ) and the derived forms are mostly nouns ( but there 's the occasional adjective ) e.g. &NAME &NAME It only contains forms where either the base form or a derived form is in the questions . Note that I 've entered the " ing " forms as &CHAR since that 's how the &NAME treats them when they occur prenominally ( the &NAME will generally treat these as derived , however , so you get the base relation and a nominalize_rel ) . However , &NAME at least sometimes tags them as adjectives and does n't treat them as derived . Some zero-derived forms are included . The file was created semi-automatically and is no doubt buggy in some respects - if you improve it , you should make this clear in your writeup and include the improved version with the code you submit . &NAME 
SUBJECT: access to machines in the Intel lab Just to let you know that your COTAG cards should now allow you access to the Intel lab ( big room full of machines on the other end of the top floor from the &NAME rooms ) . This may be useful if you want access to a &NAME machine ( or , when the weather is better , if you 'd like to sit on the balcony watching the horses ... ) If you do use the lab , please note that , though it 's rarely full , there are times when it 's used intensively and undergraduates and Diploma students always have priority . &NAME 
SUBJECT: missed &NAME lecture I 'll do an extra lecture in Language &NUM on Friday next week at &NUM ( i.e. after Dialogue systems ) to make up for the one I missed yesterday . &NAME 
SUBJECT: Language &NUM practical - parsing your own questions ( OPTIONAL ! ) This is strictly optional , but if you want to parse your own example questions to look at the &NAME , here 's what you have to do : &NUM start &NAME &NUM M-x allegro ( this assumes you still have the &NAME from last term ) &NUM at the &NAME ( &NUM ) prompt ( require : climxm ) &NAME ( &NUM ) : ( load " /usr / groups / nltools / lingo / newlkb / src / general / loadup " ) &NAME ( &NUM ) : ( load-system 'mrs " ) this loads a modified &NAME &NUM &NAME &NAME &NAME &NAME complete grammar /usr / groups / nltools / lingo / erg / lkb / local-script it is important to load local-script rather than script . you will need about &NUM &NAME spare space in your ~/tmp directory for the lexicon etc ( you can always link it to local scratch if necessary ) you can then parse sentences as you did with your own grammar last term , but you will see an &NAME option on the menu that you get by clicking on the small parse tree . This displays the &NAME in a compact notation . To get the &NAME , use &NAME to Expand menu , then &NAME / Output level and choose &NAME . then everything you parse will get an &NAME &NAME in the * common-lisp * buffer of your emacs . If you want to save your own preferences , you will have to copy /usr / groups / nltools / lingo / erg / to your filespace . then load the grammar via script rather than local-script &NAME PS - I have no way of checking that I 've got all the file permissions etc right , so if you try this and it does n't work , let me know . I am sorry for the cumbersome &NAME loading procedure , but other methods require sys-admin to set things up . 
SUBJECT: Re : Practical report Mainly in response to questions from &NAME , but &NAME to everyone for info : <QUOTE> - Do you have any preference as to whether or not the code is listed in appendices ? <END_QUOTE> we 'd prefer that you do n't give code - but do make sure that your directories are readable by us when you hand-in . The exception is that if there 's some algorithm you 're especially proud of and are writing up in detail , feel free to give pseudo-code ( preferred ) or fragments of actual code to make the algorithm clear <QUOTE> - Do you have any preference as to whether single or double-sided printing is used ? <END_QUOTE> Normally double-sided , but it so happens that we 're going to have to photocopy some or all of the marked practicals this year , so anything you can do to make this easier would be appreciated . Single-sided with a binding or staple that can easily be removed would help . The same applies to the essays . Also , in response to a couple of questions , you do not have to get high &NAME to get good marks on the practical . &NAME

SUBJECT: Women - Be Careful This one is for the ladies . This is not meant to scare you but I urge you all to be especially careful where you run alone . You may have all heard in the news about the serial rapist who has just recently struck in &NAME ( his 10th attack I think ) . Unfortunately , that is uncomfortably close to &NAME . It appears he tends to attack in daylight , approaching from behind and often in wooded areas , often public footpaths close to wooded areas . He does n't seem to be put off by risk , as a number of his attacks have been close to residential areas in broad daylight . In light of this , please try and run accompanied at all times , preferably come along club sessions . If you have to run alone ( I do all the time ) , try to avoid areas where you could be vunerable . DO NOT WEAR PERSONAL STEREOS . The risk of being attacked or raped out training is very small but do n't tempt fate .

SUBJECT: A matter of pride and honour As a former &NAME captain I thought I would get the ball rolling with some words of encouragement for everyone involed with the events of this coming weekend . As everybody on this list will either be running on Saturday or coming to support the club in our quest to defeat the auld enemy , consider this directed at you . Of all the hype that surrounds the build up to the Varsity Matches , there is &NUM message that you need to understand : EVERY SINGLE RUNNER WILL COUNT TO OUR OVERALL VICTORY I am sure that anyone who has ran a few cross-country races has at times , found themselves running around a race , wondering why they are doing it and knowing that if they lose or gain a place or &NUM nobody else will really care or even notice . 2-5ths is very different to this . Every place that every runner gains will not only matter , but it wil be crucial . Even if you are the 8th man / 6th lady in the team , if you can get ahead of the last &NAME scorer , that will make an equal effect to the final team result as the person who manages to move up from 2nd to win the race . The &NUM unique aspect of the race is that you are not running for yourself , you are running for every other member of your team . Furthermore , you are running for the pride and honour of &NAME University &NAME and Hounds , as every single place will be added up at the end of the day to decide who wins the Varsity Challenge Trophy . You can do no more training . All our preparation is complete . All you can do is give everything you have on Saturday . We have all ran the &NAME course and this will give us an advantage . However , when I stood at the finish of cuppers , I did not see a single person collapse as they crossed the line exhausted . There was no vomit or blood spilt through the effort of the race . If we are to be successful on Saturday , this will have to change . Everybody will have to run the race of their life . &NAME will come here arrogant and confident after they won the Challange Trophy last year . They will want to win again . We must want to win even more . The key factor will be team spirit . You must want to run faster not for yourself , but to ensure you do not let your team mates down . Make sure you attend pre-varsity strides on Thursday and make it to you team socials in the evening and then let the &NAME ROAR carry you round The Race . That way , celebrating victory on Saturday evening will be even sweeter . Finally , this weekend will be a great sporting occasion . What makes it great is the camaraderie and competitiveness of those who take part . For many , participation in and the winning of a Varsity Match is the pinnacle of thier sporting achievement . &NAME or lose though , it will certainly be a day you never forget , so make sure you take time to enjoy it .

SUBJECT: &NAME : A matter of pride and honour Yet again &NUM cannot be running on Saturday because of injury , but I will <QUOTE> nevertheless be at &NAME all day , not just because those running value support , but because the Varsity match is a simply unique experience . I still cite my last Varsity match of &NUM years ago as being the best race of my life , but the thing I remember most about it is not my own position , but the fact that our team placed &NUM , &NUM , &NUM , &NUM , &NUM and &NUM in the race . What made that race special was not just that I ran harder than I 'd ever run before , but that every other member of the team did too , and it was because of that that we won . That year &NAME won all &NUM men 's races , and I want to see you do it again this year . Believe me , there would be few things that feel worse than crossing the line on Saturday , as &NAME cheer , victorious , knowing that you could have run better . Cross-country races can often feel like you 're running for nobody but yourself , but &NAME is different . You have been selected to run for a TEAM , and victory , when it comes , will be as much for that team as for you individually . Try and go to your team social , think about how the race will feel , know how you are going to run it , and then go out there and do it . I wish I was able to run it with you . Make sure that you earn your place , &NAME THERE IS ONLY &NUM RACE THERE IS ONLY &NUM ENEMY THERE IS ONLY &NUM VICTOR <QUOTE> As a former &NAME captain I thought I would get the ball rolling with some words of encouragement for everyone involed with the events of this coming weekend .

SUBJECT: Re : LANG-2 practical : Named Entities for extension &NUM &WEBSITE has been fixed , for those doing the named entity extension . Cheers , eh 
SUBJECT: Lang2 Practical Update There is a new version of the &NAME code available in the usual directory . It addresses &NUM issues that were brought up , and although these are not bug fixes they may help in your development . Note : You do not need to use these new files , they are simply enhancements . The new files will also work with your existing code with no change in behavior . Issue &NUM : A new method has been added called eof ( ) that allows you to test whether all sentences have been read from the file . You may use the &NAME returned from this method in place of the return value from &NAME ( ) as your loop test variable . This allows you to continue processing the file even if you get a buffer overrun ( &NAME ( ) returns false ) . If you determine that there are only a handful of very large sentences that you do n't want to accommodate with a huge buffer , you can &NAME them using this method . Note you still need the return value from &NAME ( ) to determine whether to process the &NAME or not from that sentence ( a return value of false indicates an error reading the sentence and the &NAME is not valid ) . &WEBSITE for an example of how to implement this . Issue &NUM : Some buffer overruns are due to line length overflows . These have not come up in the regular &NAME but may show up in the named entities because they are stored as &NUM sentence per line . Long sentences may overrun the maximum line length used to read the sentences . In this case , the error message would not display helpful information . I have now remedied this by moving the previous hardcoded maximum line length into a # define in the header file . Also the error message will indicate this value needs to be increased . 
SUBJECT: Lang2 Practical Named Entities The named entity files have all been regenerated as a result of some bugs that were discovered . Specifically , several anomalies were appearing in the &NAME file format that were not being handled . This caused some sentences to fail the named entity recognition and be omitted . This has now been addressed . Cheers , eh

SUBJECT: Considering doing a PhD ? Are you thinking about staying on to do a Ph.D in either the &ORG or the Department of Engineering ? It is essential if you have any leanings towards a Ph. &CHAR , or even if you just want to discuss the possibility , that you contact the relevant department approaching an individual staff member but also by making a formal application . You will need to apply to continue as a graduate student ( see &WEBSITE for details ) and use the appropriate form available from the &ORG . The Course organisers wish to point out that quite apart from your own enthusiasm and merits , there are may other relevant constraints on being accepted , notably whether there is an appropriate supervisor with spare capacity available and space , and , of course , &NAME support . The Engineering Department and &ORG receive many applications which may pre-empt supervisors , space and grants , and you should therefore make an early application , although a potential supervisor will probably not make a decision until he / she has a clear idea of your achievement on the course . The detailed administrative position about accepting you for doctoral work is also complicated by the fact that many decisions on the award of &NAME , &NAME and other grants will have been taken before you have done your project work and completed your dissertation . You cannot , therefore , rely on your dissertation as evidence of your capacity for research : you have to carry conviction to your potential doctoral supervisor before that , and of course , the examinations and coursework assessment will be taken into account . Please do not operate on the basis of inference , presumption , or &NAME gossip about the status of departments or supervisors . At least raise the matter properly with a qualified member of staff , and make a formal application using the form from the &ORG , as this will ensure that your application is seriously made and seriously treated . If you would like a copy of the current Graduate Studies &NAME and the &ORG 's " Blue Book " please see &NAME &NAME in &NAME Administration , ( FC06 ) . &ORG Student Administration &NAME &NAME Building &NAME &NAME &NAME &NAME Avenue &NAME &NAME &NAME , &NAME &NAME &NAME Telephone : &NUM ( &NUM ) &NUM &NAME : &NUM ( &NUM ) &NUM Email : &EMAIL &WEBSITE /

SUBJECT: &NAME &NAME outage : Tuesday 29th Oct , &NUM Mains power in the &NAME &NAME building will have to be switched off on Tuesday 29th October to allow new supplies to be connected to the main distribution board for the second floor works . &NAME is scheduled to go off at &NUM and to be back by &NUM , with a contingency period to &NUM . The main computer room should remain running on battery power . The inconvenience is of course regretted . At &NUM stage it seemed that we were going to be faced with &NUM separate disruptions of this nature over the next few weeks , but strenuous efforts by &NAME and others have enabled the jobs to be combined . 
SUBJECT: &NAME &NAME outage : partial reprieve Earlier in the week I announced a power outage for &NUM next Tuesday , 29th October ( with possible overrun to &NUM ) . After much discussion , it has now been decided that the work can be carried out safely with the majority of the power distribution board " live " . Only the circuits immediately adjacent to those being worked on will need to be switched off . The circuits to be switched off supply the telephone equipment ( which has battery backup ) and some of the air handling units . Thus there is likely to be some degradation in ventilation and environmental control , but all power and lighting circuits are now expected to remain on . There is a remote possibility that when the work starts it will be found necessary to switch off after all , so the time period advertised should still be regarded as vulnerable to possible disruption of supply .

SUBJECT: Re : Notice of an Election - what do Junior &NAME do ? I have been asked to explain about the Computer Science Syndicate and the role of the junior members . The Computer Science Syndicate is the &ORG 's equivalent of a Faculty Board . Broadly speaking , the Syndicate has the same powers as a Faculty Board , overseeing the running of the Department and administering its teaching . The membership consists of the Head of Department , the professors in the department , the Director of the &NAME Service , &NUM representatives of the General Board , &NUM person from Engineering and one from Maths , &NUM representatives elected by officers in the department and &NUM junior members elected by the student body . The Head of Teaching and the Secretary of the School of Technology attend as non-voting observers , the Departmental Secretary is co-opted annually and acts as Secretary to the committee , and the Deputy &NAME is co-opted unless he or she is a member in another category . The Chairman of the Computer Science Syndicate and the IT Syndicate ( the &NAME Service ) are historically the same ; the office is currently held by &NAME &NAME , the Head of Department at the &NAME Laboratory . &ORG receives the Minutes of the Staff Student Committee and the Teaching Committee , and itself reports to the General Board of the University . &ORG Minutes are sent to the Secretary General of the Faculties , the members and to Officers in the &ORG . Copies are filed in the Departmental Secretary 's office , currently Room &NAME , &NAME &NAME Building . The junior members , &NUM Tripos student and &NUM research student , attend the first part of each meeting during which unreserved business is discussed - that 's the bulk of the business and includes things like the &NAME 's annual report , accreditation matters , examiners " reports , teaching matters related to the Tripos and diploma courses , the use of calculators in exams , new proposals for courses , etc. Reserved business covers matters referring to named members of staff ( e.g. promotions and leave of absence ) , and such things as the appointment of Examiners and the Form and Conduct of examinations . The Chairman may ask for the junior members " views on any of the unreserved items , or they can address the meeting through the Chair if they have anything they want to volunteer . If a junior member has a particular concern that they think should be discussed by the Syndicate then they are welcome to talk it over with me first ; the matter can then either be included on a Syndicate agenda , or referred to another person or body . Syndicate meetings are fairly formal and reasonable dress is required ! The timetable for meetings is set a year in advanced and published in Reporter and the University Diary . There are usually &NUM dates in each academical year , but routinely &NUM or &NUM meetings will be cancelled because of lack of business . Meetings are held in the Syndicate Room ( FW11 ) in the &NAME &NAME Building at &NUM on Thursdays . There is nothing to stop someone being on both the Syndicate and the staff student cttee . The jobs do n't overlap much because the latter deals with ongoing day to day questions , suggestions and complaints - how lecture notes are distributed , such and such an exam question was too difficult - whereas the Syndicate is another step up . So if the SSCOMS raised a serious problem that needed higher level discussion , then the matter could be put to the Syndicate . &NAME that helps . &NAME &NAME Departmental Secretary and Secretary of the Computer Science Syndicate

SUBJECT: Opportunity to study and travel in &NAME - &NUM / &NUM Opportunity for &NAME students to study and travel in &NAME &NUM / &NUM The College has received an invitation to send a number of students to &NAME University of Economics for the academic year &NUM / &NUM . &NAME is a private university situated in Fukuoka , on the island of &NAME , &NAME . This is a generous offer as &NAME will provide each student with return air fare , free accommodation , &NUM hours a day of Japanese language instruction , all meals and excursions within &NAME . Students will also have the opportunity to earn money through teaching English . Please see below for a brief summary of the scheme . This offer is open to undergraduate and graduate members of the College who are due to complete their course of study and graduate this summer ( ie summer &NUM ) . The offer does not extend to students who will not graduate this summer . If you are interested in this scheme there will be an opportunity to ask the &NAME and Dr &NAME questions on Thursday &NUM January at 7.00pm in the &NAME &NAME Room . You are encouraged to attend : this is a remarkably generous offer ! Students who are selected for places at &NAME University of Economics will be expected to stay there between September &NUM and July &NUM . Selection will be made by the Tutorial Committee . Any eligible person wishing to apply for a place should send a written application to the Senior Tutor to arrive no later than &NUM noon on Wednesday &NUM &NAME &NUM . Applications should include a full cv and a personal statement , in not more than &NUM words , giving the reason why you wish to travel to &NAME and what you hope to gain from the experience . A brief summary of the scheme : * Up to &NUM students a year ( &NUM from &NAME , &NUM from &NAME &NAME &NAME &NAME ) * Air fares paid by &NAME ( details of flights and visa requirements to follow ) . However , these have to be repaid in full by the student if the student leaves the scheme before Christmas , and &NUM repaid if the student leaves before &NAME . * Accommodation provided at no cost to students in individual rooms , each with en-suite bathrooms and small but well-equipped kitchens , in the new building . * Free use of computer facilities . Computers will be installed on the top floor of the building which will be reserved for foreign students , and includes a lounge area and Sky TV ( &NAME &NAME , Premier League Football etc ) . All other facilities in the new building ( such as table tennis , billiards , karaoke ) will be available for use and free of charge . * Students eat for free in cafeterias in either the dormitory or university . * Access without charge to all university sporting / library facilities e.g. tennis courts , swimming pool , gym and students may join any sporting clubs . * Tuition in Japanese language . This is envisaged as being either &NUM or &NUM hours a day , with that amount of time again being spent by students in preparation for the following day 's lessons . This conducted by qualified teachers of Japanese . Upon completion of the course the level of students " Japanese ability will be Level &NUM of the Japanese Proficiency &NAME , which is the level demanded by London-based recruitment agencies specialising in Japanese-speaking staff . * Lectures in various aspects of Japanese culture , history , politics etc. * There will be staff fluent in both Japanese and English on hand &NUM hours a day in the event of a problem , medical or otherwise for which a Japanese-speaking person is necessary . * Trips to various places of cultural and scenic interest are also planned , but details have not been discussed yet as to destinations . These will tie in with the content of the lectures mentioned above . * For none of the above will any students incur any cost whatsoever . * &NAME to run from September to July . There is no reason why any student who wishes to stay on a little longer or arrive earlier cannot do so . It is not offically part of the scheme but worth noting that evenings will be free and work teaching English privately is readily available and quite lucrative with &NUM pounds an hour being a rock-bottom rate , and &NUM to &NUM being more common . This is English conversation , so no knowledge of Japanese is necessary , or in fact any English teaching qualifications or experience . &NUM or &NUM hours of work a week nets &NUM to &NUM hunderd pounds a month , and most students work more hours than that . In these days of student loans this will be a boon to any impecunious student , especially as no tax is payable in &NAME for &NAME citizens for the first &NUM years of residence .

SUBJECT: &CHAR and &CHAR practical Hi students , the description of the computing and the web practical will be on the C-W webpage coming Monday . &NAME 
SUBJECT: &CHAR and &CHAR practical -- a question and its answer Hi I got an email asking how the same &NAME file could be associated with both a &NAME and a &NAME &NAME schema at the same time ( without editing the &NAME file ) . The answer is that this is not technically possible -- for this practical you can comment things in and out of your files . Here 's the long answer : &NAME and &NAME &NAME are alternative schema languages , and in no real-world application would anybody have BOTH associated with the same file , as I asked you to do for this exercise . Thus , the &NAME specifications do not define an elegant syntax to connect an &NAME file to both . In the practical , you will have to comment the DOCTYPE declaration ( and for later answers , certain processing instructions ( &NAME ) in and out of the &NAME file during this exercise -- send the final &NAME file with all lines in it , but commented out , I will be able to figure out what you meant . As a reminder : &NAME validation needs a hard-wired DOCTYPE declaration in the &NAME document . Use &NAME to validate . RelaxNG validation works with the program jing -- give it the RelaxNG schema as a parameter , and comment the DOCTYPE declaration out . &NAME this clarifies things-- &NAME &NAME : &NUM small remark about what you said -- you said that if you omit the DOCTYPE declaration , your &NAME is VALID . This is not the case -- for validity you need a schema by definition ! What you probably meant is that the parser does not complain , but in the given case this only means the &NAME is WELL-FORMED -- the parser automatically switches to a well-formed parse only if it finds no DOCTYPE declaration . If there is a DOCTYPE declaration , the stakes are higher , and several things must now hold : the dtd must exist , must comply with &NAME syntax rules , and must correctly describe the structure of the &NAME instance . - ------ End of &NAME Message

SUBJECT: Re : &NAME : Language &NAME <QUOTE> Hi &NAME , I was wondering if you could please let me know where the top-docs and question files that we can use for testing our baseline system or could you please make these available ! thanks &NAME : ) &NAME , <END_QUOTE> the parsed questions ( currently best version ) are in ques-out-jan29.rmrs &NUM parsed answer files are in rmrs / ans ( namely questions &NUM and &NUM ) . This data should be enough for your immediate testing needs -- please let me know if this is not the case . We are currently working on &CHAR ) parsing all top_docs and &CHAR ) the exact rmrs 's will also change in the final version . They will contain more information , but are already syntactically correct ( cf. the corresponding dtd ) . &NAME 
SUBJECT: Re : &NAME : Language &NAME <QUOTE> I was just wondering if you could unzip the files so that we can test our programs using the documents in that folder . Unfortunately our disk quottas are so low we ca n't fit in an unzipped version of the files in our own directories and do n't have permission to unzip them into that folder ! <END_QUOTE> It makes little sense to unzip the &NUM ( example ) files now , as in the long run , the &NUM files will have to remain zipped due to limited disk space ( remember , these are the analyses of &NUM &NUM documents ! ) You 'll have to find a way to unzip them on the fly , eg. using zcat , or , if your program cannot read in from standard-input , you 'll have to put a temporary file on the /tmp of your machine . &NAME 
SUBJECT: Re : &NAME : Language &NAME Hi , we had to fix something in rmrsdump - thanks to &NAME for finding out . You have to copy the C++ classes and headers again from /usr / groups / mphil / qa03 / xmlrmrs / and recompile if you start trying things out on the big files . Sorry for inconvenience caused . - &NAME 
SUBJECT: &NAME &NUM Practical Hi students , a number of questions about the &NAME &NUM practical have accummulated . Here are the answers : &NUM The baseline system should include treatment of &NAME arguments and other information -- just word matching is not enough . &NUM The deadline for it ( you should be finished with it by Friday next week ) is just an internal deadline -- you will describe the entire system , baseline Plus extension , in your report . &NUM The eval directory should now be visible from your directory . &NAME 
SUBJECT: Re : &NAME : Language &NAME -- buffer size Hi &NAME , as &NAME found out , sentence [ &NUM ] in &NAME has &NUM bytes and is too long for the current memory buffer ( default &NUM bytes ) . So use the constructor with a buffer size : &NAME rmrs ( &NUM ) ; instead of &NAME rmrs ; and slowly upgrade this should you run into this problem again for future sentences . - &NAME 
SUBJECT: LANG-2 practical : new version of &NAME * Hi , &WEBSITE is available ( thanks to &NAME ) that deals with the buffer size problem by printing out how much space is needed in case of a buffer overrun . This will keep people from having to guess . ( &NUM was the size needed to get all the way through q1 ) . Please copy this new version from /usr / groups / mphil / xmlrmrs / xmlrmrs. * and recompile . &NAME 
SUBJECT: xmlrmrs fixed Dear students , in a version of last night 's xmlrmrs , the last sentence ws not processed to the end . &NAME built in some changes , this is &WEBSITE again and recompile . ( Then you do n't need &NAME 's workaround ) . &NAME says : &NAME this is fixed now . The behavior of the Windows stream library is slightly different then gnu and gnu was returning a fail bit set on a call to getline ( ) with a long line . &WEBSITE and xmlrmrs.h Other changes : Implemented the &NAME error handlers so we will get line number information if it detects a malformed &NAME file or &NAME . For the students : &NAME : : &NAME ( ) now takes a boolean value . If false is passed in , it will &NAME the creation of a &NAME for that sentence . This is helpful if you are analyzing a sentence , say [ &NUM ] and want to &NAME the others : A value of true is the normal behavior . This is set as default so you do not need to change your programs unless you wish to take advantage of this feature .

With google and / or researchindex as search tools , you can find virtually any recent paper on the web . To make it easier to you , each lecture note already lists the papers which are covered . As you might have found out , most of my topics are not covered in detail in juraffsky / &NAME so you have to read papers . ( I will add some useful pointers to other books in some cases , eg. Schuetze / &NAME has some good chapters ) . I assume the paper you are looking for is &NAME et &NAME 's paper .

Because you should report your system 's performance on the test data without any changes to your system , this data is deliberately held back until the very end . The difference between the system 's performance on the test data and on the seen ( development ) data -- which you should also report -- tests the generalisability of your strategies . &NAME 
SUBJECT: Re : Language practicals -- evaluation <QUOTE> <QUOTE> &NUM For evaluation , please exclude questions that are not parsed . <END_QUOTE> &NAME , does this mean that the system should provide no output for these questions , i.e : &NUM &NUM &NUM &NUM &NUM &NUM &NUM &NUM if question &NUM does not have a parse structure . <END_QUOTE> Correct , this is how you should be doing it -- &NAME is not lowered if you have no output for a given question , cf. eval.pl . &NAME

SUBJECT: Re : &NAME project workplan the workplan is good . Needs more detail for weeks &NUM . Make up some potential milestones . Separate into " overall algorithm " ' feature detection " ' feature determination " . Time for installing an off-the shelf &NAME text classifier or &NAME algorithm . Week &NUM could be half same incremental eval / improvement as in week &NUM , and half human evaluation and analysis of results . &NUM day running the experiment of asking sb ( partha ? ) to annotate sentiment shift , a day or &NUM for analysis . Automatic eval on test corpus should not take as long as a week . It 's just a guess at this point : it 's gonna change a bit anyway . I can give you detailed comments on a draft if you manage to get the draft to me &NUM days before the final deadline . This is a hard deadline -- later than that , an &NUM cannot give you comments anymore , because I am also one of the examiners . Calculate this in , with the exact date , when you write the workplan . It definitely helps the mark / report to get these comments . So it 's in your own interest to have something ready by then . I suggest to split the data into : &NUM -- annotated training data . I do n't think you want to promise you 'll do &NUM , but if you find &NAME fast , you can do it and it will improve your results . Do n't promise it though . &NUM -- unseen test data , for final eval . &NUM should be enough . &NUM -- seen development data : you can allow yourself to do searches in it , look at them , see how the current system classifies and make decisions on the basis of it , because you are allowed to look at it . Important for developmetn corpus to be reasonably large . &NAME text overall -- Possibly replace " in parallel " for " interchangably " - or is that what you meant ? &NAME &NAME when you say shifting-window technique . Define topic shift when you first use it . Annotator agreement : you with yourself after several weeks is called intra-annotator agreement . You with somebody else is called inter-annotator agreement . &NAME resend me the more detailed plan for weeks &NUM before you submit . - &NAME 
SUBJECT: Numbering on test data Are you guys okay with the data as it is ? Somebody suggested I change the numbers to &NUM . I will do that , but only if there 's sufficient interest .

Could you please send me you &NAME . Thanks . I need it for the entry material . Cheers , &NAME If you 're not &NAME &NAME ( whoose email have trouble remembering ) , I apologise - and please ignore this . If you are , however - here 's my email to you : Hey &NAME - this probably repeats much of what you 've already said , but elaborates a bit more ... It 's mainly taken from some guy who seems to have studied this a bit ... &WEBSITE pick and choose from it as you wich . &NAME It should be noted however that there is no such thing as a game only for women . &NAME efforts should be in the direction of games that appeal to both genders and utilise the female market that way rather than targetting them exclusively . To do this &NAME will try to appeal to " what women want " from games , while preserving traditional game ingrediences and avoiding to portray females as stereotypes . Among the things women want more of from games are the following : - ) Female roles ( to identify with ) - ) Females should never be portraid as sex objects ( because they are not identified with ) - ) Relationship issues , e.g. families , romance ... ( to provide emotional interest ) - ) Character interaction and development ( to provide commitment and involvment ) - ) Evolving story ( to provide commitment and involvment ) - ) Fantacy setting ( to provide escapism ) - ) Historical settings ( to provide interesting information ) - ) Logical puzzles ( to provide intellectual stimulation ) - ) Learning e.g. mythology , history , science . ( to provide intellectual stimulation ) - ) Combat should be presented only if rational and well integrated into the story ( because violence must be justified ) . - ) No difficult real-time combat in Adventure games ( as this is disliked by adventure games player regardless of gender . ) Now some stuff about indian software / games development ( you 've probably read this ) It 's from &WEBSITE The games software industry in &NAME is expected to grow to $ &NUM mill . within the next &NUM years , - hence awareness about gaming in &NAME is raised ( you need gaming-aware people to build successful games ) . hm ... reading this it seems more and more like this is the article you 've based your stuff on ... so I 'll leave it at that . and some suggestions for you to reject about the name : &NAME &NAME &NAME &NAME &NAME ( after the rocket used by the russians in ww2 ) &NAME &NAME &NAME &NAME &NAME &NAME &NAME &NAME &NAME enjoy . &NAME

The only possible option seems to be for you to get to &NAME for around &NUM o' clock . Then &NAME would meet you and take you to &NAME with &NAME and &NAME . This plan rests on the assumption that you can get the afternoon off work ... Here is the train information from &NAME : &NAME &NAME &NUM : &NUM &NAME &NAME &NUM : &NUM &NAME : &pound; &NUM ( cheap day single with &NAME railcard ) &pound; &NUM ( cheap day single ) Then perhaps on the way back your parent / I could meet you in &NAME or &NAME or somewhere ? Oh , and there also appears to be a 7-day advance saver ticket from &NAME to &NAME ( single ) for only &pound; &NUM if being in a cramped box on wheels with &NAME , &NAME , &NAME and possibly some guitars does n't appeal to you . I think it leaves &NAME at just after &NAME ish . Hope you 're having a good day and you can make it next weekend . Love &NAME &NAME , sounds ok , but then I still have to get back . I know about the cheap wol-dur tckts , but that does only cover &NUM way . Hmmm. Will have to have a think . * Try and make sure you can get off work . * See if your parents can pick you up at &NAME / &NAME on Sunday . If they ca n't then you could consider getting another single ticket back from &NAME to &NAME .

The cost will be &pound; &NUM per person . Please make cheques payable to &NAME &NAME and present them to me on Saturday .

I am quite surprisingly unbored , despite the fact that I still have no job and &NAME of my best friends have gone away for the rest of the summer . I seem to have a lot to do , and even though I 've given my name to countless places ( I do feel like I 've been a bit of a job prostitute ) , &NUM wants me . Everywhere else in the country seems to want employees , why does n't &NAME ? I am becoming increasingly desperate . I have lost lots of weight since I got to &NAME ( one of the first things my Dad always says to me is " Have n't you lost weight ? ! " . We are a bit obsessed in this house , my Mum is stick thin and does lots of exercise , my sister disappears behind lampposts , my Dad wants to lose weight [ thats what my Mum tells him , anyway ] , and then there 's me ... ) . So , anyway , I felt that I 'd lost enough to wear a bikini , so little &NAME and I went bikini shopping , I have a pale blue thing , it is not worth &NUM quid for that little material , and I think I 'll take it back anyway because when will I EVER EVER wear a bikini in &NAME ? ! It 's not exactly &NAME , is it ? So that 's my bikini story , sorry , you 're probably either embarrassed , disgusted or bored , but I have very little else to tell you , due to the dullness of &NAME and the fact that being boring is genetic ... you should meet my parents ... kidding . We had the church youth group over for a &NAME on Sunday , they are a noisy , rowdy lot and I escaped to my room with a book . I am going into &NAME tomorrow to get some sandals from &NAME , even though I ca n't afford them . I am a bit depressed because it looks like I 'll have to get a proper loan next year ( ! ! ! ) , so I am very anti-Labour at the moment . I am actually seriously thinking about going to see my &NAME ; to protest about tution fees and to give me something to do . He would be glad to see me , I 'm sure . It would make a nice change from all those old ladies moaning about water rates , anyway ( not that water rates are n't important at all ) . My sister 's 18th is soon and she is having a murder mystery party on Saturday . I am novelist and I get to wear a blonde wig . I have always wanted to be blonde ! ( to give me an excuse for behaving the way I do , you know ... ) . What can I give her for her present ( given my present cash flow situation and lack of imagination ) ?

Anyway , &NAME suggested I write to the TV licensing agency and inform them of our situation . This I will do with all due haste and fervour . Well , I 'd better go and eat something .

SUBJECT: Hi Hi &NAME , Are you still online ? ? ? &NAME 
SUBJECT: &NAME Dear &NAME , &NAME , sorry I did n't receive your latest e-mail until now . I guess I missed chatting in a chatroom . That 's a shame as it would have been great fun ! Thanks for your e-mail ! Very well , I relent You may assume I am intuitive ! However , I must point out that being male does not place me in a separate species from you . You see , I actually believe that you , too , are human . Please return this courtesy . " Airplane is a good film there are more in that genre . We will rent them next term . - My incredulity abounds . &NAME , yes I agree that Airplane is a good film ( generally ) but are there really more of the same genre ? That seems slightly far-fetched . Anyway , I would take great pleasure in renting similar videos next term . May I say that I found the opening scene absolutely hilarious , when the aeroplane was likened to a shark . Fantastically funny ! What do you mean by saying that your family liked the idea of your Christmas presents ? Are you trying to tell me they thought it was a lovely idea we all sent presents to each other , or am I getting a completely wrong idea ? 'my dad found the whole Tim-giving-us-photos-he'd-taken-himself thing quite amusing . My dad can relate to that . - Yes It was extremely nice to receive those presents from &NAME . He is extremely clever / economical . Do n't you think ? I can see why your dad might find the idea amusing . I rather think my family did too although they cannot relate to it . " Bored , watching lots of trashy TV . What you up to ? Do n't do anything I would n't do - Yes , I 'm a little bored too . It is quite lonely being at home all day with nobody to talk too except oneself and the fridge . The unpleasant idea of chemistry textbooks looming over the rest of the day is slightly depressing . What on earth can you be watching on television ? I can find nothing of much interest save " Friends on Friday evening and &NAME &NAME tomorrow . Well , I 'm trying to study as much as I can psychologically cope with , but I 'm going to be working in my dad 's bookshop on Wednesday and Friday this week . That should give me a welcome break from the hallowed halls of chemistry . I 'm going to be spending the New Year up in the Scottish Highlands &NAME , and may possibly be going skiing . Last time I skied I fell over . I was about &NUM . I did n't much care for it and have never been back since . I hope I do n't fall down this time as it would be infinitely more embarrassing ! Anyway , I am also looking forward to going on the internet much more as we are changing our &NAME to one which provides a totally free service . Incidentally , are you aware of the fact that we may quite well owe &NAME &CHAR &pound; &NUM at the beginning of next term ? &CHAR is quite disastrous really As you ought to have been aware , I began defrosting our freezer the morning you left &NAME ! ! ! ( Just kidding although watching ice melt is incredibly more exciting than the paint drying process . ) Anyway , back to the story Well , I asked &NAME downstairs if we could store our freezer contents in their freezer . She said absolutely not , promptly pulled out a revolver , and shot me right between the eyes I 'm now dead . No ! Really &NAME , you should n't believe such fantastically unrealistic tales ! Dear , dear , dear ! You 're just so gullible ! ( Just kidding ! ) Anyway , she said certainly we could , so we did . Now , that was at about 11am and the freezer did n't finish defrosting until &NAME . ( Mainly because I never bothered to turn it off whilst leaving the door open and placing large bowls of hot water inside it ! ) When I finally got around to retrieving our frozen food , &NAME had gone home ! So had &NAME ! &NAME I was deserted ! ! ! I was in dire straits , so I Well , I wonder , what could I have ( feasibly ) done ? Most likely nothing , but you may imagine something ridiculous if you like . &NAME suggested I promptly said " Oh bother ? ? ? and tripped over my own feet . I think that 's a little harsh . So , &NAME &CHAR now has about &NUM kilos of our frozen chips , along with multiple loaves of bread ! The real trouble ( yes , seriously ! ) is that &NAME happened to mention the fee for storage in their freezer was &pound; &NUM per hour . This did not concern be greatly as I assumed she was joking , and even if she had turned out to be serious , it would only have cost us about &pound; &NUM . However , now that we are utilising her storage facilities over Christmas , it would cost our flat &pound; &NUM . This would lower our flat bank account balance by about &NUM - not a healthy way to start the term ! The second little flat story which I shall tell you is probably one you have heard from &NAME or someone else . Just in case you have not I would like to make you aware of the fact that on Saturday morning &NAME and &NAME came to visit and , whilst &NAME was engaged in polite conversation with &NAME , &NAME and &CHAR ( and various parents ) &NAME was redesigning our water closet . It appeared , from subsequent ( although not very close as &NAME had just cleaned it WARNING ! &NAME ! ! ) inspection that the entire visit had been a ruse , the sole purpose of which was to maliciously " blacken the reputation of our " spotless toilet . On reflection and long consultation with &NAME and &NAME we decided that they had facilitated the effects desired by themselves by pouring something akin to the nature and properties of food colouring down our lavatory . This distressed and perplexed us greatly . We are still distressed and perplexed greatly . Sleepless nights have been our lot ever since . Seriously . I now expect you to be distressed and perplexed . Greatly . Do n't disappoint my &NAME . I 'm counting on your being perplexed . In conclusion I would like to say that I 'm not really sure whether or not I 'll do anything you would n't do . In fact , I can think of quite a few things I do which you would n't do and am not quite sure it would be advisable to refrain from doing them. ( ! ) Now &NAME , I have just written you a long e-mail . I know you are a very busy person ( quote : [ &NUM 'm] " bored ) and I am extremely grateful that you should take the time to e-mail me ( seriously , seriously , no sarcasm ) as I really enjoy reading them , but could you try and write a slightly longer &NUM next time ? If you 'd rather not or do n't have time then okay . &NAME , I probably should n't have said that ! ( I 'm not being judgmental , so please do n't plot to kill me ! ) See you , &NAME &NAME I really liked your Scottish accent on the " phone the other night . It was most convincing ! Perhaps you can write in the language of the gods also ? 
SUBJECT: Chat at 6ish Hi &NAME , &NAME ! Well We shall discuss your e-mail in marshallbees at &NUM precisely .

E-mail me if you ca n't make it and need to change the time or something . Well , see you at &NUM precisely . Oh , by the way . Perhaps you would like to download " Netscape &NAME &NAME Service sometime . I 'll give you the web-site address if you want to . You see , it enables you to chat directly i.e. a little box will appear in your computer screen . Also , its main benefit is that it lets you know when your friends are online . Anyway , see what you think . I will finish this short e-mail with the following quote from &NAME which we may choose to discuss this evening I quote from &NAME ; " I have similar characteristics to an amphibious-type creature who has evolved &NUM million years in a few hours and has mysteriously taken on the form of a large slug with uncontrollable mating habits &NAME

This was amusing , and may prove to be even more so if it turns out we knew the unknown guy . So , are you still well ? Are you still watching " Diagnosis Murder " every day ? I watched it today . I also watched it yesterday . However , I did n't get up at &NUM : 15am , tempting though it inevitably was . Today I synthesised penicillin ( on paper ) whilst yesterday I synthesised &NAME and &NAME ( on PAPER ) . Talking of Cocaine and Opium It could be quite interesting next term if some of our flat-mates came home to find a " Cocaine-laboratory set up in our kitchen . I can just imagine the scene Over the next few weeks subtle hints are dropped that &NAME is not quite the na 've chemist he makes out to be . &NUM morning when &NAME is checking the post she finds a parcel for &NAME from , say , &NAME . This is curious . She leaves it in his room and probably thinks nothing more of it , but perhaps she does Later that day she returns from her lecture to find the kitchen work-surfaces covered with complex-looking chemical apparatus containing curious tar-like substances that bubble . There are some shallow glass dishes containing a white powdery substance , just recrystalising from solution . The parcel is lying on the table , opened , and a lab-coat is strewn carelessly on the floor . The phone suddenly rings she picks it up to hear a curiously thick voice with a sinister-sounding message for &NAME . I do n't know what could happen next , but it may well be very amusing ( ! ) Anyway " I am not going to plot to kill you . Why would I make it that easy for you ?

SUBJECT: &NAME is DOOMED Hi &NAME , " &NAME - &NAME . " You talked to &NAME in some weird and unintelligible version of English ( can the Scots get NOTHING right ? ) - Evidently not . Think about it . Obviously you cannot either , hence your sentence without meaning . " &NAME was rude it 's just a good job &NAME and &NAME were n't there . - Why ? ? ? Do you see &NAME and &NAME as some ultra-moral , easy-to-offend , hyper-Christian people ? I was there , how different am I to &NAME and &NAME ? " What is this , I talked to &NAME in our own language ? - Well , I assume you did . Since &NAME and I talked for about &NUM minutes in whisper mode whilst there was nothing appearing on the main screen , we assumed you and &NAME were conversing in your own language . " I do not remember insulting you at any point . But enlighten me . - Most assuredly I shall enlighten you . You called me names . I then asked if you enjoyed insulting me and you replied with something along the lines of " have you just worked that out ? Do you remember ? " Maybe you could slip a little something into her early morning cup of tea to see exactly how hyper she can get funny ! - Very funny ! It is worth it just to imagine it . I am laughing as I type . " Maybe I could place you in a room surrounded by mess , with an unseen but audible vacuum cleaner next door - If we assume this took place in &NAME &CHAR then there could be some slight technical difficulties I would have to be placed in either yours or &NAME 's room as they are the only untidy &NUM . If I was placed in your room then it would n't work as vacuum cleaners are terrified of &NAME 's room . If I was placed in &NAME 's room then that would also be impossible because vacuum cleaners are terrified of you and they have no need ( I 'm not talking about desire here ) to go into my room . In either case , I 'm the only &NUM in the flat who understands how to switch on vacuum cleaners . " &NAME , are you coming to my house for my birthday ? I would love to see you , and you know my parents adore you . You could clean my room . &NAME boy I do n't offer everyone that privilege , you know . - Much as I would love to I 'm afraid I am taking my grandmother ( yes , the &NUM with &NUM lives ) to see &NAME on the 26th . I 'm sorry &NAME , thanks very much for inviting me though . I 've sent you a birthday card , so do n't think it 's a Christmas &NUM and open it on Monday ! Anyway , I did n't know you were going to have a party . Would I have known anyone else who will be there ? It will break my heart not to have the chance to clean your room . Oh ! Why do I always miss these life-changing experiences ? ! ? Anyway , is your room ever really messy ? I do n't think it is at &NAME , but then I 'm comparing yours with &NAME 's. " Got to go , I 'm going out for a meal with some friends ( yes , I have more than &NUM ) . - Who 's the one ? ( I 'm joking , I know you have lots and lots of friends just in case you get offended . ) I got &NUM Christmas cards today ! Actually , it was a bit embarrassing . Well how would you explain a Christmas card that was addressed to " &NAME " &NAME &NAME , on the envelope , to your parents when they give it to you ? That would have been relatively okay , but then I opened it and discovered it was from a guy &NAME - an interesting experience . It turned out my fears were unfounded as my parents did not conclude I had weird friends , just &NUM with an interesting sense of humour . Guess what was on the front of &NAME 's card . A duvet ! He is just so obsessed with duvets , especially his own . Well , I must go . Actually , I must n't, but I do n't want to bore you further by continuing to type when I really am not thinking much about what I am typing . Oh , I was for the rest of the e-mail , do n't worry , but not for this paragraph . I 'm pleased to hear you are looking forward to finishing your work at the &NAME Office . Have a wonderful Christmas , &NAME &NAME I 'm sorry about the " Hello ? e-mail . I was just wondering if you were still alive as you had n't e-mailed in a week . But then neither had &NUM , although that 's another story . 
SUBJECT: &NAME , &NAME , " Hyper-Christians ! " Hi &NAME ! " It 's nearly Christmas , and although &NAME and nicety pervades the land , it stops at our front door , so I feel free to insult you . - &NAME and nicety does not pervade this land . I do n't know anything about your front door , but that sounds highly likely . " Yes , &NAME and &NAME are hyper-Christians . ( I feel so unworthy ) . - Are you being honestly serious here ? " You are different because I do n't think you are easily shocked . At least , having a poker face , you do n't show it . - I may not be easily shocked , but that was quite an insult . Do I honestly have a poker face ? I 'm in despair . " It [ mess ] disturbs and distracts me . - That 's exactly the way I feel about mess too . " I am sorry about whispering . It was very rude , and I 'm sorry . - That 's quite alright . I was n't saying you ought n't to have . &NAME and I whispered too , as did yourself and &NAME " I am not having a party . I just invited everyone to my house knowing that most people would n't be able to come . &NAME and &NAME &NAME and &NAME are coming though . You are missing out on my favourite foods they are expensive , ha ha ha . - Oh , I see . I 'm glad some of your friends will be there for your birthday . I deeply regret missing out on your favourite foods , and the fact that they are expensive goes without saying really , does n't it ? " Happy Christmas , sweet &NAME , may your blessings be plentiful in the New Year . - Why , thank you &NAME ! Incidentally , did you know that &NAME and I now only communicate through his lawyer , a 'Mr &NAME ? Here is the last e-mail I received from him &NAME &NAME Esq. , As Mr. &NAME 's lawyer , I assure you that you are , how shall I put it in the soup . Frankly , you are a very unwise young man to have crossed my client . You have dealt in an immature manner , and will be dealt with accordingly . You may be assured that you will be sued to the full extent of the law , and will probably never see your homeland again . ( You can expect to be deported as a slave to &NAME . ) Oh yes , Mr. &NAME , you have played with fire , and now you 're going to get burned ( or burrrrrrrrned , as you would say ) . You have unfortunately messed with one of the most important personages in the country ( in the form of my client ) , and I do n't get paid &pound; &NUM an hour to fool around in other words , your life as you know it is about to be terminated . So there 's the good news Mr. &NAME . The bad news is that my people ( thugs / mercenaries some might call them ) will be round shortly to un-tuck your bed-sheet . Yes it 's true Mr. &NAME , I 'm afraid there is no easy way to break this kind of news . So , until we meet face to face ( probably in the dock ) let me wish you a happy future . &NAME , Mr. &NAME Quite interesting , do you agree ? Well , I have been wrapping Christmas presents this evening . Oh my , time flies too quickly , it 's Christmas once again . I shall now go and do some photo-manipulation .

( I feel so unworthy ) . You are different because I do n't think you are easily shocked . At least , having a poker face , you do n't show it . &NUM My room is really not that messy at all . In a mess hierarchy of the flat , you are at the top , followed by &NAME , then me , then &NAME and &NAME . I do n't really like mess . It disturbs and distracts me . &NUM I am sorry about whispering . It was very rude , and I 'm sorry . &NUM I am not having a party . I just invited everyone to my house knowing that most people would n't be able to come . &NAME and &NAME &NAME and &NAME are coming though .

Love &NAME <QUOTE> From : &NAME ( &EMAIL ) To : &EMAIL Subject : &NAME is DOOMED &NAME : &NAME , &NUM &NAME &NUM &NUM : &NUM : &NUM &NUM Hi &NAME , " &NAME - Catchy . " You talked to &NAME in some weird and unintelligible version of English ( can the Scots get NOTHING right ? ) - Evidently not . Think about it . Obviously you cannot either , hence your sentence without meaning . " &NAME was rude it 's just a good job &NAME and &NAME were n't there . - Why ? ? ? Do you see &NAME and &NAME as some ultra-moral , easy-to-offend , hyper-Christian people ? I was there , how different am I to &NAME and &NAME ? " What is this , I talked to &NAME in our own language ? - Well , I assume you did . Since &NAME and I talked for about &NUM minutes in whisper mode whilst there was nothing appearing on the main screen , we assumed you and &NAME were conversing in your own language . " I do not remember insulting you at any point . But enlighten me . - Most assuredly I shall enlighten you . You called me names . I then asked if you enjoyed insulting me and you replied with something along the lines of " have you just worked that out ? Do you remember ? 'Maybe you could slip a little something into her early morning cup of tea to see exactly how hyper she can get funny ! - Very funny ! It is worth it just to imagine it . I am laughing as I type . 'Maybe I could place you in a room surrounded by mess , with an unseen but audible vacuum cleaner next door - If we assume this took place in &NAME &CHAR then there could be some slight technical difficulties I would have to be placed in either yours or &NAME 's room as they are the only untidy &NUM . If I was placed in your room then it would n't work as vacuum cleaners are terrified of &NAME 's room . If I was placed in &NAME 's room then that would also be impossible because vacuum cleaners are terrified of you and they have no need ( I 'm not talking about desire here ) to go into my room . In either case , I 'm the only &NUM in the flat who understands how to switch on vacuum cleaners . " &NAME , are you coming to my house for my birthday ? I would love to see you , and you know my parents adore you . You could clean my room . &NAME boy I do n't offer everyone that privilege , you know . - Much as I would love to I 'm afraid I am taking my grandmother ( yes , the &NUM with &NUM lives ) to see &NAME on the 26th . I 'm sorry &NAME , thanks very much for inviting me though . I 've sent you a birthday card , so do n't think it 's a Christmas &NUM and open it on Monday ! Anyway , I did n't know you were going to have a party . Would I have known anyone else who will be there ? It will break my heart not to have the chance to clean your room . Oh ! Why do I always miss these life-changing experiences ? ! ? Anyway , is your room ever really messy ? I do n't think it is at &NAME , but then I 'm comparing yours with &NAME 's. " Got to go , I 'm going out for a meal with some friends ( yes , I have more than &NUM ) . - Who 's the one ? ( I 'm joking , I know you have lots and lots of friends just in case you get offended . ) I got &NUM Christmas cards today ! Actually , it was a bit embarrassing . Well how would you explain a Christmas card that was addressed to " &NAME " &NAME &NAME , on the envelope , to your parents when they give it to you ? That would have been relatively okay , but then I opened it and discovered it was from a guy &NAME - an interesting experience . It turned out my fears were unfounded as my parents did not conclude I had weird friends , just &NUM with an interesting sense of humour . Guess what was on the front of &NAME 's card . A duvet ! He is just so obsessed with duvets , especially his own . Well , I must go . Actually , I must n't, but I do n't want to bore you further by continuing to type when I really am not thinking much about what I am typing . Oh , I was for the rest of the e-mail , do n't worry , but not for this paragraph . I 'm pleased to hear you are looking forward to finishing your work at the &NAME Office . Have a wonderful Christmas , &NAME &NAME I 'm sorry about the " Hello ? e-mail . I was just wondering if you were still alive as you had n't e-mailed in a week .

SUBJECT: Regarding our secret love affair ... This is a long and in-depth e-mail . Please do n't read it unless you have time . Thank you . Dear &NAME , Please do n't let your mother find out about our secret love affair . ( I am not being serious , but I guess you worked that out . ) It was good to hear from you yesterday . Anyway , the tricks &NAME left for the geology department at 2pm on Tuesday . I duly went down to the &NAME Trading Company and bought a substantial quantity of grass seeds for &pound; &NUM . I had been anxious that sowing grass seeds would do lasting damage to the carpet and that I would therefore be in a rather sticky situation . Therefore , I decided to do as follows I went to the &NAME &NAME and asked the lady there if I could borrow the keys for one of my friend 's rooms as they had forgotten to turn off their storage heaters before going home . She willing obliged but asked me to bring them straight back . I then quickly returned to the flat and opened &NAME 's room , placing on the floor a bin-liner on top of which I spread a damp dish-towel , sprinkling grass seed liberally over its surface . I then watered the towel and rushed back with the keys , after hastily turning off &NAME 's heater and checking &NAME 's. The lady was most thankful . So , I did n't carry out the trick as planned , for the carpet does not belong to me . I would have had no hesitation if it was &NAME 's or mine , but it is n't. However , it should still be amusing for &NAME to return and find a patch of grass growing in his bedroom , though he had locked the door . Now , trick number &NUM Earlier that day I made my way over to &NAME &CHAR to see &NAME . He obliged by giving me the relevant details but warned me that you had better not try to sell his stereo system . Anyway , I tried to call &NAME and find out about his guitar - &NAME only knew it was a &NAME &NAME guitar , and that &NAME had got it in a sale for about &pound; &NUM . Unfortunately &NAME was n't answering . Since time was quickly marching on I could n't go to &NAME to post &NAME 's advertisement , and I had n't the necessary information from &NAME anyway . So , this trick has not yet been completed . However , I intend to go down to &NAME sometime during the holidays and I will finish it then . In any case , that will only serve to make it even less understandable for &NAME , since the phone calls are not going to begin immediately after the holidays start . Well , on Tuesday I also managed to clean most of the flat , including the shower and bathroom . I also walked to the science site to visit the library and show my friend where the &NAME department was . In addition to that I defrosted and cleaned our fridge / freezer , and also cleaned my room with the utmost thoroughness . After that I had to pack my room , and as a result of my hectic morning , after busying myself with all this running around , I had to rush frantically to the railway station . I arrived on the platform , much out of breath due to the rather weighty nature of my bags , to see the train pulling out of the station . My heart sank , as the next train was not due for at least an hour . Thankfully it was not my train , which had been delayed by the ineptitude of &NAME by &NUM minutes . This was &NUM time when I was thankful for inefficiency . Eventually my train arrived and I embarked upon my journey , sad to leave &NAME . My train was then delayed my vandalising children on the railway track . I arrived at &NAME over &NUM minutes late , but still in &NUM piece and much calmer than I had been while rushing to try and catch my train . Now , I will keep you up to date with the latest happenings in that exiting focal point of all our lives , &NAME &NAME Well , on Monday evening &NAME invited &NAME and &NAME and &NUM first year &NAME girls for dinner . The meal was most delicious , and afterwards one of the first years was given the opportunity to cut &NAME 's golden locks - a most amusing occurrence indeed . The poor unfortunate girl was halfway through the task when she accidentally cut some of &NAME 's ear off . Now , you know what &NAME is like when he gets angry about something Well actually , he did n't assault her , but he yelled and almost cursed about it for a substantial number of minutes . I think the blood contrasted beautifully with his pale complexion . So &NAME now has a mutilated ear , something he will doubtless cherish as it was done at the hands of one of his favoured girls . I wonder if we could make him think we had paid &NAME ( the unfortunate girl ) to carry out her heroic deed ? Imagine his reaction ! Anyway , are you well ? Was your trip to &NAME library beneficial ? Are you pleased to be at home and did you enjoy your night our yesterday ? When you sent your last e-mail I was in the middle of a power cut . At &NUM : &NAME I was gaily about to check my e-mail , when the computer switched off and I was plunged into darkness . We proceeded to eat our dinner by the light of oil lamps . We lit our fire and &NUM the played the piano by candlelight for half an hour . It was very beautiful , but could get boring quite easily . I then went up to my room , oil lamp in hand , and began to study . At &NAME the electricity came back on and I received your e-mail . Thank you . My next piece of uninteresting trivia is that I now have absolutely free internet access at any time of the day or night ! We have signed up to ntl , the telephone company , and that is why I am sending you this in the middle of the day . Any time you wish to chat online just let me know , as it would be fun . Also , if you want &NAME &NAME &NAME Service , it can be downloaded from the following location ... &WEBSITE o73026 &NAME is going to get it , and possibly others . It is an extremely interesting piece of software which allows you to chat easily ( via text or voice ) online . It also allows you to see whether your friends are online if you or they want . It 's fun . Well , I have written some words to you , and I hope you are well and enjoying your holidays . Write back to me soon . I look forward to hearing from you . &NAME 
SUBJECT: Regarding our next tryst ... My dearest &NAME Meet me by the willow trees beside the river tomorrow at midnight . How shall I recognise you ? Anyway That was a rather psychedelic e-mail . I hope the colours do n't represent your moods because if so then you changed from a rather girlish pink to a morbid black , then back to the same pink before becoming a very light ethereal sky blue and ending with a more stable medium blue . You ought to see a psychologist . I do n't think that counts as orifice checking , but it 's still important . I 'd just like to point out , &NAME , that biology is nothing like chemistry whatsoever . I do n't really even consider biology a science . All biologists do is draw pictures of rabbits eating carrots . Chemistry is sooooooo much more sophisticated . We explode things . I was n't worried about &NAME taking on &NAME 's characteristics , more his parents and mine . No , I 'm not going down to &NAME especially to place an advertisement in &NAME . Honestly &NAME ! I would post it if that were the case ! No , I 'm going down to see the flat . " &NAME , why are you studying &NAME ? - I 'm studying because I have an enormous amount of work to do before the exams and I want to do better than last year . I know holidays have only begun , but I 'm bored already . I did n't know you had asthma . So , you went for a run . That 's the problem with living in a city ; when you do something , people see you although they probably do n't notice . Here in the country people notice . " I am going to my friend 's house tonight to say hello and look at her new extension ( fun ) . - Extension of what ? " The time thing is very very amusing . - &NAME thing ? Do you mean &NAME 's ear ? Incidentally , due to foot and mouth , we now get our post delivered only to the end of the road , newspapers are no longer delivered , and suspicion reigns . &NAME . It 's very cold here . I envy you the warm climate of &NAME . Although , you probably do n't think it 's warm . Now , &NAME is feeling rather unwell these days , and I think I shall send her a get well card . Would you like to do the same ? &NAME 's address is &NUM &NAME Road &NAME Park &NAME &NAME 3PT He said goodbye to &NAME today , I quote 'Miss &NAME has now left , and therein lies a story : I was taking her to &NAME to drop her off with her brother , and she assumed that it would be easy enough to find the place because she knew what it was called &NAME Halls . Thus , she did not ask for directions , and upon arriving in &NAME , she realised that it was somewhat bigger than she had expected and we would perhaps not be able to just " find the place by knowing its name ! And so , &NUM people , a number of text messages and an hour later we eventually found our destination ! Anyway , she is there now and I am emailing you from my living room where &NAME is currently residing . See you later , &NAME He often calls me " o fair and wondrous &NAME strange .

I do n't know , do YOU think I have moral standards or not ? " - Do I have your permission to be " holy " ? &NAME loves us . He does n't like us the way we are , that 's why he wants to change us to be like &NAME . I 'm sure you do have moral standards . Not as strong as &NAME 's, well , perhaps just different . &NAME has the effect on me of inducing me to relax my moral standards . There is something about people with higher moral standards than your own which can be slightly suffocating . I have not discussed morals at length with you , so I ca n't say very much , except that you come across as being more concerned with being able to get alongside people in order for them to notice that you 're a Christian and talk about it in their own time , rather than being more separate from them . This is good . It is also good not to compromise your principles - that is what &NAME does . I am not saying you do , and I am not judging you - please remember this ! Out of curiosity , and as a topic for conversation , what do you think about my moral principles ? 'Daisy looks forward to the ever-closening day when she gets to know our pet a little better . " - Soon to be . " No , things are NOT moving quickly with &NAME . They are not moving anywhere at all . " - Have I struck a nerve ? &NAME , just joking . " I would not make myself an object of ridicule just for your amusement . " - &NAME I 'm disappointed . &NAME did . " Why ca n't I tell &NAME you went shopping ? Does n't he like you helping old people ? " It was on a Sunday , &NAME I like being patronising to people ! The story about &NAME and &NAME was absolutely hilarious . You made me laugh a lot . Thank you , you are very funny . " I have had my hair cut , but it does n't look great , never mind . I 'll just tie it up . " - If it 's not as bad as &NAME 's then it 's fine . " I have n't done a lot of work yet but I have been out for another run ! " - Do n't worry , you sound as if you 've done more work than &NAME , and running is good . Have you started your diet again yet ? " When are we going to connect via the internet , of course ? " - Oh , good ! Well , what about Friday evening at &NAME ? Are you free then ? Can you use &NAME instant messenger , then we do n't have to bother about chat-rooms ? It only takes &NUM minutes or so to download , and it 's wonderful . If you want the web-address , then ask me for it . Now , what do you think about the following adverts for the &NAME thing ? For &NAME &NAME , &NAME CMT-CPT .

SUBJECT: &NAME Dear &NAME , Hi ! Did you have a good time at " &NAME &NAME " ? Did you do anything interesting ? Thanks for your e-mail , which I received whilst on holiday . I had a lovely holiday in &NAME &NAME , did not see any Irish mice , and sent you a postcard . Incidentally , I know I wrote in my postcard that the &NAME Isle had no foot and mouth , and I 'd just like to make it clear that the postcard was written before the current outbreaks . &NAME 's mum is 'secretly worried that &NAME might be a drug dealer . " What do you think of &NAME 's well-thought-out cottage idea ? Well , " we could make it very cheap " ( is she hinting at a subsidy here ? ) and " we could invite LOADS of people " ( delightful ) and " or somewhere " ( as usual , an excellent grasp of specifics ) somehow sound interesting . So , about &NUM people are descending on a very cheap cottage for a week - how delightful . A lovely idea ; it might even work . I have been revising organic chemistry for a week ( this is the first time in my life I 've studied the topic , which is about a third of my degree , and I 'm pleased to say I am enjoying it and it is rather interesting ! ) . I have also been moping over the demise of &NAME and the ascendancy of &NAME . Oh dear , change again . &NAME really ought to have tried harder . The mass populace ( &NAME ) thinks she 's old and past-it . &NAME seems to have all the appeal these days . Well , today I had a lazy morning as I was tired from &NUM hours travelling yesterday - we did n't get home until &NAME last night . I then did a small amount of studying this afternoon . I am shortly going outside ( it 's very windy weather , but otherwise pleasant ) to build a step up to our house . I will be using cement for the first time in my life ! Would you like to chat online sometime ? &NAME and I may be doing so this evening at &NAME , although I have n't heard from him , so it 's doubtful . Whenever is convenient , send me an e-mail . I 'm looking forward to seeing you soon , &NAME &NAME When are you going back up to &NAME ?

SUBJECT: [ Fwd : [ Fwd : &NUM / &NUM ] ] found them ! &NAME love &NAME x &NUM &NAME ( &NAME or Mr. ) ( &NAME and Prejudice ; &NAME ) * Because he 's the ultimate . I fell in love with him when I read the book when I was &NUM , and then all over again when he looks at &NAME just so so so intensely . And then he 's basically the modern version on &NAME , and it 's just the way he looks at her . &NUM &NAME &NAME ( from the " &NAME " books by &NAME &NAME ) * There 's a big chance you wo n't have read these books because they are n't &CHAR . well known , but they are book I would love to have written . They are so beautiful and poetic , and the heroine is an author ... and &NAME is beautiful . &NUM &NAME &NAME ( The &NAME &NAME ) * He does everything for &NAME , and yet still she ultimately rejects him ... it 's so tragic and such wonderful prose . &NUM &NAME ( Much Ado About Nothing ) * I think because I am very like &NAME , and would like to find my own &NAME &NUM day ; someone quite like me ! ( And because my &NAME 's name was &NAME , so I feel I have some connection ) . &NUM &NAME &NAME ( The &NAME &NAME Affair ) * It 's the money and the pinstripe suits ( mmm , men in suits ) ; o my word , he 's eminently fanciable . He has everything except me ! &NUM &NAME ( &NAME &NAME &NAME ) * He 's had so much practice ; and he 's so considerate and caring about what his women want . &NUM Captain &NAME &NAME ( The Sound of Music ) * Again , it 's the way he looks at &NAME when he realises he 's in love with her . He 's fine ! ( But maybe without the children ) . &NUM &NAME &NAME ( &NAME &NAME ) ( Yes , I do know that he was &NAME ) * I think because he epitomises the decadence of the pre-war period that I 'm in love with . I would love to have lived in that way in those decades ; so carefree and spirited and hazy , doing what you wanted all day , all those English traditions and repressed emotions , those magnificent low-waisted dresses and cloche hats . The threat of war looming near , yet the First World War seems almost romantic in a way , with men dying poetically on the mist-filled battlefields ... I wish I had lived then . &NUM &NAME &NAME ( The &NAME &NAME ) * Now this is the soppy of all soppy books ! But I read it when I was &NUM and I love it still . The period ( Georgian ) appeals to me too . &NUM &NAME or &NAME ... ca n't quite decide which ( I Capture the &NAME ) * But only really because I want to be &NAME &NAME , the narrator , because she knows what it is to be in unrequited love , and the last few paragraphs of the book are so hopeless , yet so hoping and beautiful . ( &NUM . &NAME &NAME 's cop in LA &NAME ) * &NAME !
