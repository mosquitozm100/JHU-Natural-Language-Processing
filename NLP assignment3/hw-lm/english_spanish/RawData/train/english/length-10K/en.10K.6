     It is recognized that the logical relation of causality
     between the lines of action presently indicated for the
     first year and the outcomes expected at the end of the
     Project is not completely coherent; however, it is assumed
     that they should be used as a point of departure in
     preparing the first national work plans to specify the
     initial activities in the lines of action considered to be
     of a priority nature and to indicate the local health
     systems in which this is feasible.

     This option is considered to be fully valid, since, while
     respecting the current expectations of the countries, it
     provides the opportunity for identifying and reformulating
     the actions that must be taken in order to attain the
     expected results through in-service apprenticeship in the
     real environment of the local levels.  Successive
     evaluations and programmings will provide feedback for this
     preliminary assessment, and the new lines of action decided
     upon will be incorporated into the Project document.

     As a result, once the Project is approved, the next step
     will be the preparation of local programs for the
     formulation of national plans, which will be consolidated in
     the Annual Subregional Work Plan, to which will be added
     activities it is considered desirable to carry out at the
     subregional level in accordance with the principles of
     subsidiarity and economy of scale. 
VIIIBUDGET FOR THE FIRST YEAR

     The Project budget for the first year has first been
     organized generically and indicatively by each of the five
     components and then distributed according to cooperation
     mechanisms and resources.

     The specific breakdown by component, type of cooperation,

     specific requirements that are agreed upon to implement the
     programs approved by each country for each local health
     system in the four-month programming periods.
IX  ORGANIZATION AND ADMINISTRATION OF THE PROJECT

     A.  Operational Characteristics

In using decentralization as a policy, primary health
care as a core strategy, and the development of local
health systems as the operational tactic to bring about
the transformations discussed above, the Project will
be resolutely oriented toward analysis, design,
experimentation, and evaluation in networks of services
in specific population areas in support of the 35 local
health systems that have been considered as priority
targets for development in the subregion.
     
As a result, the activities will be developed
predominantly at the regional and local level, although
intervention will take place at the central levels when
necessary for development of the local level. 
Accordingly, the resources will be applied principally
in local health systems in accordance with the
realistic requirements of the processes that are
effectively taking place. 

Social participation is a key element in the success of
the Project, and consequently viable and flexible
activities are required that will allow for the
expression and involvement of all community groups and
institutions that are interested in and are capable of
making a contribution to improving the health and
welfare of the population covered by local health
systems.

Attempts will be made to bring about true democratic
participation, and in this connection it will be
necessary to orient the social groups toward active
participation in the formulation and execution of
specific actions that respond to the priority needs of
each local health systems.

Implementation of this nature is expected to bring
about greater social control in executing the Project
that will provide better knowledge of the areas in
which the most effective solutions for each situation
can be achieved.

Consequently, the Project will incorporate as executing
entities all the social actors--sectoral institutions, 
nongovernmental agencies, political-administrative
authorities, and civil society organizations that are
truly engaged in local health system development and
will support the Project in accordance with the social
participation arrangement and strategy that each local
health system adopts.

The Project will not require setting up a specific
subregional or national specific infrastructure, since
it will operate by utilizing the existing subregional
cooperation organizations and by increasing the
installed cooperation capacity in the PAHO/WHO
countries so that it can be decentralized and used to
provide direct support to the local health systems.

     B.   Organization

At the national level, the Project will be directed by
the organization that coordinates the PPS/CAP
subregional projects in each country and by the local
PAHO/WHO Representation. 

At the local level, the Project will be coordinated by
a professional from the population covered by the local
health system who will work with full dedication and in
close collaboration with the local health authorities
and supported by the technical supervision provided by
the local PAHO/WHO Represe
