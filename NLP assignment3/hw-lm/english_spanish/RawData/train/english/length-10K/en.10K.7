n to their uninfested counterparts, which

required only 1.62 inseminations.  Mortality in replacement
heifers affected by Fasciola and Clostridium hemoliticum was
also seen (11).

     In all cases of losses directly caused by the disease one
should add the expenditures for the management and antiparasitic
treatment of the affected animals.
     
     2.   Losses caused by the seizure in abattoirs of the
livers of the affected animals.

     The number of confiscated livers varies according to the
area affected, the annual climatic variations, and the
possibilities for control and registration available in each
country.  In addition, the recorded losses that these seizures
generate are related to the specific price of the meat at the
time of the study.  Many of the data obtained come from the
abattoir records.  However, there are studies done by
investigators during a specific period that provide more precise
information, in which it was observed that the number of
seizures due to this disease is significantly higher than
official records show.

     In Argentina, in studies of abattoirs in the northwestern
provinces - Salta, Jujuy, and Santiago del Estero, of 2,090
livers studied, 271 were infested with Fasciola (12), confirming
data observed previously (13) for the northeastern area,
particularly from abattoirs in the province of Corrientes where,
it was observed, between 9% and 13% of all livers checked were
seized.  The official figures for bovine livers confiscated,
shown in Table 1, fluctuate between approximately 1% for the
years 1988 and 1990 and 4.9% for 1989 (14).

     In studies done in Chile, the prevalence of distomatosis
ranged from 13% to the critical level of 94% (15).

     In the Eastern Republic of Uruguay in the period from 1972
to 1973, of a total of 11,253 bovine livers reviewed, 52.85%
were confiscated due to the presence of Fasciola (16).  As can
be seen in Table 2, the official data for this country indicate
that 54.67% of bovine livers were confiscated in 1981, but the
percentage rose to 59.67% for 1990 (17).

     On the Bolivian altiplano, at an altitude of more than
3,000 meters, levels of prevalence of bovine distomatosis that
varied between 50% and 60% were observed (18).

     In Brazil, the incidence measured by coprology ranged from
61% in adult cattle to 50% in calves in a study done in the
state of Paraná, although the average figures obtained from
abattoir records over the entire country show a prevalence of
seizures on the order of 12% (19).  In particular, in the area
of Rio Grande do Sul a prevalence of 15% was observed (20).

     In Cuba, rates of liver seizures due to Fasciola that
fluctuated between 10.7% and 32.9% were observed (21).

     On the island of Jamaica, in a stool survey done on cattle
it was determined that 22.2% of the animals were infested (22).

     In Puerto Rico, bovine distomatosis is considered
hyperendemic; records show that 82% of the cattle are infested
with Fasciola (17).

     In Mexico, the prevalence varies according to the area
being considered.  Thus, figures for the seizure of bovine
livers infested with distomatosis that range from 6% (23) to 74%
(24) were observed.

     In Costa Rica, using stool analysis a prevalence of
Fasciola in cattle from 23% to 69% was determined, depending on
the region under study (25).

     In Colombia a prevalence of 40% determined by analysis of
bovine feces was reported; the infected cows were less fertile
and a higher proportion aborted than among their uninfested
counterparts (26).

     3.   Economic losses and effects of this disease on public
health.

     Human infection with F. hepática was observed in numerous
countries.  Unfortunately, it is in Latin America where the
greatest number of cases are observed (18).

     To the above-mentioned economic losses that are caused by
this disease should be added those in the area of public health
due to the expenditures for treatment, days of work lost,
technical diagnoses, and hospitalization costs.

     Unfortunately, human distomatosis is a disease that does
not require official notification, which means that records that
show the trends in human infection are not available .

     Studies done in Peru show that in Valle del Mantaro the
prevalence of the disease in children of school age is 15.6%,
while in adults in the same area it is 13.3% (27).

     In Cuba, up to the present there have been epidemics of
human distomatosis in 1944 and 1983; a significant correlation
was observed between increases in rainfall and in the
temperature of the environment and the appearance of the disease
(28). In this country up to 1944 more than 100 verified cases
of human fascioliasis had been recorded.  However, in a single
Cuban clinic 27 clinical cases of distomatosis alone were
observed during the period from 1973 to 1976 (22).

     In Chile, according to the records up to 1959 82 verified
cases of human distomatosis were reported (7).

     In the state of Puebla, Mexico, distomatosis was found in
0.6% of the population (29).

     In Puerto Rico, where bovine distomatosis is considered
hyperendemic, in a health survey done in the area around farms
that produced watercress it was found that 11% of the human
fecal samples examined contained eggs of Fasciola (18).

     In Bolivia, in the region of Kallutaca in the altiplano,
where the prevalence of bovine fascioliasis is approximately
70%, it was observed that 48% of 90 school-age children examined
had eggs of Fasciola in their feces (17), suggesting that the
prevalence of human distomatosis in the Bolivian altiplano is
extremely high and that there is an urgent need for the
attention of the local health authorities.


RECOMMENDATIONS

     The control of human distomatosis is firmly tied to the
control of the disease in animals.  Antiparasitic treatments
against F. hepática, carried out strategically in conjunction
with rational management of the roundup, appreciably reduce the
contamination of the environment and, as a result, the danger
of human infection.

     Health education in the areas of endemicity with special
emphasis on the risks of this disease, its symptomatology, and
the recognition of the infective agent (metacercaria) and of the
intermediate host snail, particularly in the primary and
secondary schools, would undoubtedly reduce the levels of human
infection.

     Special prevention alerts should be implemented in the
rural communities where the disease is endemic after heavy rains
and elevated temperatures so that the population avoids
consumption of potentially contaminated plants and is aware of
the risks of the infection with Fasciola.
