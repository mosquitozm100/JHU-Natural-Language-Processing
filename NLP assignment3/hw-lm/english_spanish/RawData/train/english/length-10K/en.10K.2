of
action for the extension of health care coverage to most exposed, most vulnerable, and
least served workers, including children, women, indigenous peoples, and the
handicapped, as well as those in the informal sector, bearing in mind that only a small
percentage--less than 10%--of the working population currently benefits from
comprehensive attention in accordance with ILO instruments.  These lines of action will
need to be innovative and envisage alternatives such as primary health care and local
health services, in addition to considering new modalities of social security, so that the
action taken will be preventive, rather than strictly curative.  The plans will encompass
various basic components, including:  specific policies, legislation, regulation and
standardization, promotion, utilization of mass communication, information, generation
of knowledge and epidemiological surveillance, active participation, manpower
development, institutional strengthening, development of services and programs,
surveillance, and control.  The will also call for the adoption of an ergonomic approach
to personal health care so that simultaneous consideration is given to the working
environment and the techniques used in the workplace, to tools and machinery, to the
organization of work, and especially to health education and prevention in the workplace.

        The foregoing discussion points up the need to review the types of benefits that have
traditionally been offered to workers, with a view to ensuring that they are line with
current socioeconomic and labor realities, new risks, and available technical and medical
possibilities for prevention.

        The preparation of a National Plan should make it possible to achieve within
institutional structures the constitution of an information network that will promote the
elimination of unhealthful, dangerous, explosive, toxic, and uncomfortable working
conditions, with priority given to the reduction of occupational risk factors that not only
are directly harmful to the health of exposed workers but also produce environmental
changes that are detrimental to the entire population.  In addition, an effort needs to be
made to adapt the requirements and conditions of work to the capacity and ability of
working women and men.

        A set of guidelines (Annex III) has been drafted to aid in the preparation and revision
of the National Plans for the Development of Workers' Health.  These guidelines stress
the importance of multidisciplinary cooperation between the various institutions and
health programs, with support and collaboration from the community, unions and trade
associations, and especially employers and workers.

        The National Plans for the Development of Workers' Health will have, inter alia, the
following frames of reference and specific targets:

        Improvement of the health of workers:
Reduction of the number of fatal accidents
Reduction of the cases of disability and disease
Reduction of work-related diseases 
Promotion of factors that contribute positively to health
Promotion of health education and healthy lifestyles
Implementation of measures to increase the average length of economically active
life

        Adaptation of working conditions to the characteristics of workers:
Reduction of risks (prioritizing the most serious risk factors)
Creation of better safety and hygiene conditions in the workplace
Guarantee of basic sanitary conditions in all workplaces
Control of workers' exposure to dangerous substances

        Formulation of a National Plan of Action:
Generalized participation and interinstitutional cooperation
Programs, services, protection, prevention
Coverage for the least served groups 
Utilization of innovative strategies
Collaboration in the areas of hygiene, safety, and occupational health, and in other
disciplines concerned with the issue, making optimal use of existing structures

        The development of a National Plan presupposes identifying the most serious
deficiencies and finding ways of eliminating them.  The most pressing needs generally
are: 

        Personnel to achieve the objectives in the area of practice, research, and training
        (training at all levels:  training in occupational health for health workers; training of
        specialists in safety, hygiene, occupational medicine, and others disciplines relating
        to occupational health; and training of workers and employers).

        Epidemiological surveillance in workers' health in order to identify the most
        vulnerable groups and those who are exposed to important work-related risk factors
        and pathologies. 

        Research on work-related injuries and diseases, risk factors, measurement techniques,
        tools and equipment, most vulnerable and least covered groups, and preventive
        techniques.

        Information and education to raise awareness and encourage self-care and to enhance
        the effectiveness of interventions.

        Improvement of the human resource development for all professions and trades, with
        a view to providing workers with the training required so that they will become
        involved in prevention activities in the workplace and in the promotion of workers'
        health.

Delivery of Cooperation in Workers' Health by the Organization

        In order to support the enlistment of participation by the national working groups, the
interinstitutional committees, and the multidisciplinary technical commissions responsible
for the formulation and implementation of policies and plans, the Organization is
intensifying the provision of advisory services to the countries, utilizing for this purpose
all the operating capacity at its disposal or within its reach.

        To give priority to workers' health, in addition to enlisting the participation of the
WHO Collaborating Centers in the area of workers' health, the Organization is
concentrating its efforts on the activities defined by the PAHO Interprogram Group on
Workers' Health, which is identifying the activities that each Program can carry out with
regard to workers' health in its area of specialization and expertise, as well as the
activities that require interprogram collaboration.  The same type of articulated
collaboration is being proposed in the Country Representations.

        For the delivery of cooperation the following scheme is utilized:





PAHO AND COOPERATION IN WORKERS' HEALTH

        In the Country Representations (generalized support and actions by the focal points
        for environmental and occupational health)

        General activities (dissemination of information and knowledge, training,
        fellowships, research, intercountry initiatives, intercountry cooperation)

        Activities by the various programs in the area of workers' health, coordination by the
        Interprogram Group at Headquarters

        Activities by the Program on Workers' Health (under the coordination of the
        Program on Environmental Health)


        A basic document has been prepared for evaluating progress in the implementation
of Resolution XIV.  This document is intended to help the countries to find the best
procedures to quantify the advances made and adjust their orientations and activities
accordingly.

        The interprogram solidarity that is being demonstrated within the Bureau and in the
countries will undoubtedly make it possible to achieve better levels of health and well-
being in the working population, extend the average length of economically active life,
decrease absenteeism, reduce human suffering and disability, and, thus, increase
production and financial and social development.  The Meetings of the Governing Bodies
this year are of historic significance in that they mark the official inauguration of "1992: 
Year of Workers' Health."

INSTRUCTIONS


- Parts I, II and III of the instrument are prepared on the
basis of country documents, reports, and studies that provide
the most recent information.

Items 3.6, 3.7, 3.15, 3.16 are prepared from interviews with
nurses in various positions at different institutions.

- Sections A and B of Part IV are prepared from local health
system reports and documents and an interview with the local
health system director.

The following items in Sections C and D are obtained from
interviews with nurses and observation of their work:

Section C, Items 4.10, 4.11.
Section D, Items 4.12, 4.13, 4.14, 4.15, 4.16, 4.17, 4.19,
4.20, 4.21, 4.22, 4.23, 4.24, 4.25, 4.26, 4.27, 4.28.

As a basis for conducting the interviews and observations of
the work, a sample is selected from nurses assigned to in-
hospital and in outpatient units.

Forms #1, #2, and #3 may be used to record the information
from each of the nurses interviewed and observed.

- Part V of the instrument is prepared with information
obtained through analysis of reports and documents and
interviews of nurses in the local health systems (in-hospital
and outpatient units).

- Part VI of the instrument is prepared with data obtained
through the analysis of documents.

The estimate of the average cost of the activity is
calculated by dividing the monthly wage or salary by the
total number of hours worked during the month, which gives
the average time allocated to the activity (additional costs
charged to the activity are not inclu
