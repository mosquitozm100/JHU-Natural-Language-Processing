he problems and challenges they have to deal with.

3) To increase knowledge about the content and design of education programs for
nurses which will help to improve population-based health services administration
and develop nursing personnel. (8)

The frame of reference for this study came from a conference held in 1988 with the
participation of nurses, physicians, and health and other administrators. The main
problems faced by nurses in administrative positions were identified. The result of
this conference is summarized in one of the chapters of the book.


International Administration of Nursing Services. (9)

Among its main recommendations, this study called for: development of systems for
interaction between administrative nurses and other professionals; preparation of
job descriptions; improvement of training for nurses involved in administration;
promotion of advanced interdisciplinary education at the doctoral level;
establishment of national research institutions; creation of research positions for
nurses; and promotion of the formation of national and international groups to carry
out research on nursing administration. (10)

Finally, it was felt that nurses need to have strong capacity as leaders and
administrators in order to orient primary health care services and to act realistically
in the context of the new health care paradigm proposed by the Director-General of
WHO, who points out that a new realism is taking hold throughout the world, that
resources are not unlimited, and that consequently those who do the planning and
decision-making in health must identify priorities, focus on efficiency and cost-
effectiveness, and offer better health services through through improved resource
management while at the same time not compromising quality (Henry Beverly et al.,
1991). (11)

Nurses today cannot ignore this appeal of the Director-General of WHO if they wish
to make a more effective contribution to the goal of HFA/2000.

A review of the documents reveals clear contradictions between the declarations
that recognize the great potential of nurses for accomplishing PHC in the health
systems and the opportunities for participation that in reality are open to them in
many of the countries.

Greater consistency should be sought between discourse and action in order to
support and utilize the potential of nurses and promote their real participation in
planning and decision-making on health care policy and in nursing at the national
level and in local health systems.

This brings to mind the words of Dr. H. Mahler (1986) at the inaugural session of an
international meeting on nursing leadership held in Tokyo, Japan, at which he
pointed out that, among the health professions, the profession of nursing has
always shown strong dedication and commitment to social goals, as well as
willingness and readiness for change. The role of nursing in effecting the changes
that are needed in the health systems in terms of PHC, is very clear. Nurses work
everywhere, offer care at all levels, represent the most numerous group of health
workers in a number of countries, and are in direct contact with the people they
serve; and they often serve as the principal link between individuals, the family, and
the health system. Working with the people, nurses are permanent witnesses to the
harm caused to the population by inadequate health services, and as a result they
are in a position to advocate on behalf of those they care for, to give them support,
and to maintain credibility. Nurses, he concluded, can become an important social
force in the community. (12)




THE ROLE OF THE NURSE IN PRIMARY HEALTH CARE


The contribution of nursing to PHC within the sociopolitical and economic context of
the individual countries is unquestioned. However, the impact of their interventions
on the state of health and on the quality provided to individuals, families, and the
community has neither been studied nor demonstrated.

Statistics for the countries and the Region of the Americas indicate that there has
been progress in meeting the targets for the vaccination of children, reducing
mortality in children and mothers, meeting the targets for health care coverage of
pregnant women, reducing morbidity and mortality from ADD and ARI, utilizing
ORS, and increasing the practice of breast-feeding. All these actions rely to a great
extent on nursing, and it is necessary to assess the impact of nursing care in the
advances achieved, as well as the effects of its limitations on attainment of the
desired goals.

An evaluation of progress in the effectiveness of nurses in the provision of primary
health care for mothers and children in three countries of Africa--Nigeria, Zaire, and
Swaziland--showed satisfactory results in terms of the impact of nursing
interventions on the care of mothers and children and in terms of social mobilization
of the community after they had received a short continuing education course in
PHC.

The "praxis" concept--meaning knowledge about the principles and elements of
primary health care and their practical application for the improvement of health
care, in this case for mothers and children--was applied in this project in work with
families and communities.

The results were considered to be successful.  They call attention to the need for a
review of the way in which use is made of the potential and capacity of nurses in the
interdisciplinary health care team. (13)

Also worthy of note is the great potential, undiscovered or not utilized, that exists in
the national and international nursing organizations and the significant role they can
play in making PHC operational in the local health systems.

The evaluation of this project demonstrated:

1. That nurses have a good foundation in their basic training and that, with a short
period of continuing education, they can develop their great potential.

After they had participated in one-week workshops, the nurses had gained a much
greater understanding of the dynamics of community work and the policies and
elements involved in PHC.


2. Nurses are capable of preparing effective tools and developing the ability to
collect, organize, and analyze information related to primary health care.

3. Nurses have the capacity and the attitude to become valuable leaders who are
appreciated by the community when they learn to work on an equal basis with
community leaders and with individuals and groups.

4. When the community sees nurses working with them locally, it understands their
role, clarifies its image of them, and gains the benefit of their support and care.

5. The problems most often solved by nurses were:

a. Environmental:  personal hygiene and hygiene related to housing, food, water,
exposure to excreta, refuse, etc.

b. Physiological problems:  fever, diarrhea, infections, anemia, pain.

c. Psychological problems:  these were the most complex to resolve:  depression,
anxiety, stress, worry.

d. Behavior and beliefs with regard to health:  self-medication, female circumcision,
visits to shamans.

e. Social problems:  alcoholism, religious conflicts, unwed mothers, mental
problems, delinquency. 

With regard to community mobilization, the nurses identified eight (8) priorities and
problems that community leaders worked on with the support of the nurses:  1)
reconditioning of a road, 2) electricity, 3) water, 4) building of a health center, 5)
building of a schoolhouse, 6) ignorance, 7) difficulty in obtaining medical care, in the
site of reference, 8) difficulties in obtaining patient care in the hospital (Morrow
Helga, Holzemer, William, INC, 1990). (13)

Another study aimed at evaluating the impact of nursing interventions in PHC was
carried out in the European Region of WHO.

The Regional Office for Europe (1987), pursuant to the goals of PHC, has been
holding working meetings since 1982 with a view to developing criteria, setting
standards, and defining processes to ensure the quality of nursing services at the
national and local level. Detailed needs for the quality program were identified at the
local level, where this task will begin.

The WHO Regional Office for Europe (1989) held a second meeting to review the
changes that had taken place in nursing practice as a result of the improved quality
of services, to analyze the effects of the training program on the development of
standards for quality, and to examine the possible approaches that will make it
possible to implement these quality standards in local health systems and at the
regional and national level. (14)

Each of the countries in Europe has designed its own methodology and strategies
in accordance with its sociocultural, political and economic characteristics so that
the program on nursing care quality will reflect national and local needs. Systems
have been developed for the classification of patients and for the establishment of
standards for community nursing care for families, schoolchildren, and specific
groups who are experiencing a particular health problem.

As mentioned earlier, different approaches have been taken. For example, in
Sweden the National Association of Nurses (1988) has undertaken a project that
focuses on productivity, efficiency, and quality in nursing care. The purpose of this
research was to document the role of nursing in achieving the goal of efficient
health care. It began by making nurses aware of their responsibility with respect to
this goal as part of the quality health care process.

The participants in this working group identified the critical points that need to be
analyzed in order to establish a program on quality, including: socioeconomic and
cultural aspects; legal and professional requirements for health care; the power and
autonomy of professional nursing practice; techniques and methodologies leading
to quality; and coordination of political, interdisciplinary, financial, and research
activities. (15)
