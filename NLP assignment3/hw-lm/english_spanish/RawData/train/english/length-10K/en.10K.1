or work in these areas will assist in reorienting
public health toward reaching targets and objectives more likely to improve the living
conditions and, obviously, the health of the population.  These areas form the bases for
developing work patterns that will contribute to improve the circumstances and lifestyles
that influence health (2).

     Consequently, it becomes clear that health promotion, in the final analysis, refers
to health in development and is a strategy that makes it possible to seek a greater
commitment on the part of all to improvement of the quality of life and of the
environment in which we live.

     Health promotion thus forms part of the political area of the various sectors and
levels, which constitutes one of its greatest successes and a significant advance in
bringing about the action desired; similarly, from a positive perspective, the concept of
work for health is incorporated into the daily life of the individual and the community as
a whole.  In addition, health is considered as a resource for the development of the
peoples of the Americas, and a high value is thus assigned to human capital.

     The responsibility of the health workers should include a search for the general
welfare that extends beyond changes in lifestyles, and it should also include this important
area of positive changes in order to avoid the risks associated with them. 


IMPLEMENTATION MECHANISMS

     Several mechanisms have been identified in the programs and activities for health
promotion with the aim of strengthening the participation of the people in health
interventions at both the individual collective levels.

     Thus, for example, education, as an instrument for changing human beings, plays
an important role in transforming living conditions and bringing about changes in
unhealthy behavior.  However, health education is a problem for the health sector in that
its success also depends on the commitment and effectiveness of the education sector. 
Health and education, jointly, should apply methodologies to inform and educate adults,
and also to create attitudes and less risky lifestyles for the generations to come. 

     In taking into account the importance of health education and information, PAHO
also defined "Using Social Communication in Health" (1) as a complementary and
empowering strategic orientation for health promotion. 

     The provision of health information and knowledge to the population and the
promotion of community discussion on the needs and alternatives to be considered in
seeking the common welfare reinforces the principles of health education and the
democratization of scientific knowledge.  The purpose of this orientation is to capture the
interest of both the specific workers in the sector and of the social and political sectors in
order to obtain their support for the changes that will help the population to attain higher
levels of health.

     One of the major challenges for the health sector today is the design of information
programs and materials for the entire population, those educated formally and those who
have not had the privilege of formal education.  The methods and techniques of social
communication, which were developed for other purposes, have an enormous potential
for application to health.
     
     It is worthwhile mentioning briefly some of the interventions in the industrialized
countries that have been successful in changing the behavior or lifestyles currently
associated with major health problems, such as non-communicable diseases, accidents and
traumas, and addictions to substances harmful to health. 

     Among these interventions are school education, which seeks not only to provide
health knowledge to children and adolescents, but also to change their behavior so that
they will resist external pressures from their peers to lead them to hazardous consumption
and behavior. 

     Another of the successful interventions are the specific activities of social
communication, such as use of the mass media, which is reinforced with interpersonal
communication and "behavior models" selected from within the community to exemplify
healthy behavior.

     Community organization is decisive and involves a process of strengthening the
mechanisms of natural participation of the communities in jointly analyzing health
problems and searching for solutions among representatives of the sector and
representatives of the various formal and informal groups.  In the English-speaking world,
the "advocacy" approach is often used, which in the final analysis seeks to create a climate
of social conscience with regard to a given problem, thereby facilitating political decision
and, above all, supporting its implementation.  The best example of this is the campaign
against smoking, which, inter alia, in creating a collective conscience regarding its effect
on health, promotes regulatory action to protect nonsmokers and enforce legislation
against advertising. 

     Interventions at the community level should be supported by public policies, both
at the national and local levels. 

     Regulatory policies, tax increases, regulation of the food industry, and protection
of the environment, among many others, are indispensable in the task of promoting health. 
This must not be overlooked, and it is very important that it be incorporated into the
health sector and into the actions of health workers in coordinating the efforts of a variety
of sectors.


DEVELOPMENT OF THE STRATEGY

     Development of the strategy of health promotion requires strengthening the health
infrastructure.  The new tasks that are added to public health activities concerned with
noncommunicable disease prevention and associated risk factors, together with the
intersectoral activities that must be carried out to improve health levels, demand both
human and financial resources.  This should be taken into account to an even greater
degree in the developing countries, where the economic crisis has left very little
opportunity for investing resources in preventive activities and where the expenditures for
curative services, which are also necessary, are becoming increasingly burdensome. 

     Reorientation in the training of human resources is urgent in order to devise public
health approaches that are consistent with health promotion. 
     
     Health policies also require important changes, especially with regard to providing
a true response to the most outstanding problems.  Illustrative of this is the fact that in
countries where cardiovascular diseases clearly number among the most urgent health
problems, no policies are being formulated to diminish their frequency.  For this reason,
the need is emerging to correlate health planning with epidemiological analysis to a much
greater degree.

     The resources and approaches of the health programs should be reoriented so as to
utilize epidemiology to a much greater extent, not only for the purposes of planning in the
health sector but also for planning in other sectors that are concerned with the determining
factors of health conditions and, consequently, of development.  Again, the need for
intersectoral action is immediately apparent at all levels of action.


PAHO PROGRAM ON HEALTH PROMOTION 

     In 1991, the Program, theretofore called Health of Adults, became the Regional
Program on Health Promotion, introducing certain structural and functional changes
through the strengthening of the components of social communication and management
of information.

     The mandate for the Program includes application of the strategy of health
promotion in several technical fields that fall within its purview and collaboration with
other units and programs in assimilating operational concepts, principles, and mechanisms
to implement the strategy in the member countries.  Insofar as the specific technical
aspects of the Program are concerned, health promotion is an axis that serves to articulate
approaches to highly prevalent problems in most of the countries in the Region, such as
the noncommunicable cardiovascular diseases, cerebrovascular diseases, cancer, chronic
respiratory diseases, mental disorders, drug abuse, and traumas and accidents.  In addition,
the Program has been assigned the technical responsibility of helping to improve the
quality of life and well-being of special groups, such as the elderly, and to promote human
development through better mental health.

     Generally speaking, unhealthy lifestyles are closely related to the technical fields
mentioned, and consequently any effort to change them is of great importance in this
Program.

     For the purpose of implementing the new orientations of the Program, lines of
action have been formulated that are directed toward garnering support in the countries
for implementing community-based programs aimed at reducing the morbidity and
mortality associated with the problems mentioned above, together with programs that
promote the formulation of policies, plans, and programs to improve the quality of life of
the population, both adult and elderly.  High priority is being assigned to the mass media
and the dissemination of information to mobilize the population in the search for
alternative healthy behavior.

     Approaches and mechanisms for health promotion may also be identified in other
PAHO programs and in interprogram activities that emphasize the role of health in
intersectoral work for the development and improvement of the living conditions of the
population.  Cholera is a good example of this type of work.  The catastrophic situation
revealed to all by the epidemic of cholera, which the Director has framed within the
context of the interrelationship of health development (5), has made it possible for the
Organization to analyze more clearly the fundamental and historical role it should play
in implementing the principles of health promotion in the countries.
