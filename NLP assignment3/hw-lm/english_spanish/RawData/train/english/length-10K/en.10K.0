nutrition, agriculture, medicine, research, and
related fields.

Endemic goiter is a major health problem in
mountainous areas, especially in the Andean
countries.  It is characterized by a deforming
enlargement of the thyroid gland and is the
result of a shortage of iodine in the diet.
Thanks to national salt iodization policies,
endemic goiter has been significantly reduced 
in several countries of Latin America.

        `IDENTIFICATION` OF VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN IN THE
LEGISLATION OF LATIN AMERICA
Mónica Bolis *
Introduction
     Violence is a widespread condition in all societies of the
Region.  Although it affects men as well as women, it affects the
latter to a greater degree.  Aggression towards women assumes
various forms including physical, mental, and sexual abuse, and
creates qualitative and quantitative consequences that differ from
those for men. This is due to several factors; from the perspective
embodied in the existing legal resources that ought to prevent it,
to the possibility of activating the legal machinery destined to
sanction it, violence against women finds favorable conditions in
which to flourish. The fact that most modalities of abuse towards
women are not defined in the legislation makes it impossible to
correct them.  Furthermore, this type of crime has remained, until
very recently, hidden "in the realm of private life, family
intimacy, feelings of guilt and shame, and up to certain point,
traditional customs and culture".  Finally, even in situations
where there is broad legal coverage, "such regulatory progress has
not been accompanied by a parallel improvement of relations in the
sociological arena".  The influence of these sociocultural factors
produces a situation that is disadvantageous for women.  Not only
do they violate a woman's human rights, but they prevent her from
having access to the same opportunities as men, to enjoy health as
"a state of physical, mental, and social well-being".

     The existence and perpetuation of the phenomenon of violence
against women, in addition to constituting a violation of human
rights, is yet another form of discrimination against women, and
a transgression of the principles contained in declarations and
international conventions intended to prevent these aberrations. 
In some cases, the fundamental, basic legal standards of a specific
legal system do not reflect the obligations that the State has
assumed upon endorsement of the international instruments for the
protection of human rights.  In other cases, the adaptation of
national legislation to the international provisions is only
partial, or lacks the enforcement mechanisms necessary to ensure
their application. This is not to imply that the solution to the
problem of violence against women will come strictly from
legislative reform, or from increasing the punishment of persons
committing an offense.  There is an intricate web of social factors
that, together with a supportive legal regime, is required in order
to achieve effective realization of human rights.  However, the
creation of an adequate legal framework is one of the fundamental
mechanisms to establish a system that will ensure that humans live
together in dignity.

     The question then arises, if it is clear that violence against
women constitutes another violation of human rights, why do we
speak of discrimination when referring to it?  Even more so, why
do we refer to international standards as one of the regulatory
mechanisms to adapt legislation on the subject?  Because violence
against a woman is without doubt a consequence of unequal treatment
towards her person, of a restricted conception of her value and the
function that she fulfills in society.  In many cases, these
considerations pervade the legal framework and create situations
that perpetuate the same conditions of violence that the very laws
attempt to prevent.

     The reference to international law is also important. 
Although most of the international instruments on human rights do
not refer explicitly to violence against women, they generally
concur in regard to guaranteeing rights without distinction based
on race, color, sex, language, religion, national origin, birth,
or any another social condition.  By incorporating the
international provisions in its domestic law through ratification
of a particular treaty or convention, the State is committed to
adapting its legislation to the postulates contained therein, thus
ensuring the coherence and logic of its legal system.

     Within the context of these preliminary observations, this
chapter will analyze the legislation of Latin America to identify
the sociocultural factors pertaining to gender that create
favorable conditions for perpetrating violence against women.  It
will also point out those provisions that, in breaking with gender
stereotypes, make it possible to prevent or avoid situations of
violence against women, thus representing effective instruments for
achieving equity between women and men with respect to enjoying the
right to health.  The term gender will refer to "the identity of
men and women as determined by social factors (and that also
explains the relations established between them)".        

     The hypothesis used for the analysis argues that sociocultural
factors create conditions of inequality that can restrict or limit
the opportunities of women to enjoy, on equal terms with men,
health as a state of complete physical, mental, and social well-
being.  It is also argues that the influence of such factors in
legislation limits the State in fulfilling the commitments required
by its endorsement of the international instruments on human
rights, in particular the Convention on the Elimination of All
Forms of Discrimination Against Women, the American Convention on
Human Rights (Pact of San José de Costa Rica) and the Additional
Protocol to the American Convention on Human Rights (Protocol of
San Salvador).  Finally, it is recognized that the solution to the
problem of violence against women cannot be based exclusively on
legislative reformulation, that is to say, it should not be limited
to the penal, litigious, or administrative realms.  What is also
required is a change of attitude regarding the value of women, with
a subsequent elimination of the hierarchical relationship between
the sexes.

     Regarding the methodology used for analysis of the legal
standards, it is important to point out that no attempt is made in
this study to formulate value judgments with respect to the
standards, but rather to determine the extent to which the existing
provisions foster conditions that are conducive to the perpetration
of violence against women.  That is to say, up to what point these
provisions create, taking into account contemporary expectations,
conditions of inequality that allow the exercise of violence
against women.

     Based on the previous discussion, the first items to be
studied in this chapter will be the international conventions
already mentioned, which provide a framework or support for a
series of human rights principles whose validity has been
recognized by the State.  It will then analyze the general
characteristics of legislation in Latin America concerning the
treatment of violence in its different modalities.  Finally,
conclusions of the study will be formulated, and discussion
encouraged to outline a series of principles that could serve as
cornerstones in the reformulation of existing legislation.
