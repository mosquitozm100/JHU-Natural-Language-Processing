ion, the food inspectors were trained in their
     application and also in the utilization of specific
     inspection procedures.  With the collaboration of FAO, a
     "Manual for the Training of Inspectors of Street Food" was
     developed.

Central America:

     A project was developed to review the food control systems
in various locations in Guatemala, Costa Rica, El Salvador,
Honduras, Nicaragua, and Panama; it covered domestic products,
street food, imported food, and food for export.  Based on this
review, in 1992 harmonization of the regulations and procedures
used was initiated.  Under the coordination of an international
adviser, national consultants in each country are updating their
country's laws and regulations, utilizing the Basic Food Law
recommended by FAO and WHO as a model.

     A basic course on techniques for inspection of food,
including street food, took place in March 1992 in El Salvador. 
In addition, in Honduras a Subregional Course was offered on
Hygienic Practices for the Preparation, Distribution, and Sale
of Food in the Street, which was attended by those responsible
for the training of the street food vendors in Costa Rica, El
Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, and El Salvador.

     Through subregional courses in Venezuela and Mexico, the
methods of microbiological analysis and food research for the
identification of V. cholerae were reviewed.  Such courses
correspond to joint action by FAO, PAHO, FDA, CDC, and USAID.

Ecuador:

     In December 1991 a project was established with the
assistance of FAO to strengthen the control of the quality of
the food that is sold on the streets of the principal cities. 
With the assistance of international consultants an updated code
of hygienic practices in the preparation of street food was
prepared and a subprogram organized for its control.  In
addition, a group of inspectors was trained in basic inspection
techniques.

Bolivia:

     A project was formulated, with initiation expected in March
1992.

Mexico:

     A specific, previously adopted project will be initiated in
May 1992; it will strengthen quality control and will ensure the
safety of street foods.  It will begin in specific urban
semiurban areas and in Mexico City and San Cristóbal Las Casas,
Chiapas.

Chile and Countries of the English-speaking Caribbean:

     In those countries projects with emphasis on control of the
importation and exportation of food are under negotiation.  In
the case of Chile, supervision to ensure the correct use of
wastewater is being considered.


2.  CHOLERA IN THE AMERICAS

2.1. Epidemiology of Cholera in Latin America.

     In Latin America there are an estimated 600 million people
that inhabit territories with varied ecology, including
highlands with mountains over 6000 m above sea level, valleys
between the mountains, and immense subtropical and tropical
plains, in addition to extensive coastal areas on the Atlantic
and Pacific Oceans.  In this geographical area white, black,
indigenous, and mixed populations are settled.

     The area also contains large nuclei of populations that
live under marginal conditions in the large cities - an
estimated 40% of the total population, with the consequences for
health that are generated by the lack of basic sanitation and
the lack of health services coverage.  To this should be added
the growing phenomenon of urban expansion so that the cities
will be housing approximately 75% of the population of the
Americas by the end of this century.

     The differences in health among the countries are large,
but those within a single country are still greater, because of
the various living conditions that determine the existence of
groups at greater or lesser risk and the low coverage of the
health services.  Those differences are not just geographical,
but also technical and economic and they contribute to greater
vulnerability to the prevalent etiologic agents.

     That is the scene presented by the American Hemisphere to
Vibrio cholerae which made its appearance at the end of January
1991 in Peru with cases in the port of Chimbote.  The disease
spread rapidly and in March there were approximately 20,000
cases per week, with a nonhomogeneous distribution which
produced three waves of the epidemic, one corresponding to the
coast, another to the mountains, and the third to the jungle
region of the Amazon.

     Thus during 1991 and through 20 February 1992 in that
country 358,247 cases were notified of which 135,835 had to be
hospitalized and 3,058 died.  The incidence in 1991 was 14 per
thousand population and the fatality rate, 0.9%.  The latter was
due to the lack of knowledge of an exotic disease and to the
deterioration of the health and sanitation infrastructure caused
by the present economic crisis in that country.

     The epidemic, once it had invaded Peru, continued by
spreading through the Latin American countries.  Thus the first
cases appeared in Ecuador in February 1991; that country
reported 46,284 cases for that year and for January and February
of 1992, more than 6,000 cases.

     Next, in Colombia the epidemic started in the beginning of
March in the area along the border with Ecuador at the Pacific
coast, with approximately 12,000 cases registered in 1991 and
around 3,600 cases through February 1992.

     Since then the disease has been invading other territories
and its presence is detected in a different country of the
Region month after month.  In the month of April the first cases
were detected in the United States, which had a total of 25 for
1991 and another two for 1992.

     In Latin America approximately 81% of the cases of the
disease have been recorded in Peru, 12% in Ecuador, and 3% in
Colombia, with the rest distributed among the other countries,
except that Paraguay and Uruguay have no diagnosed cases to
date.

     The conditions under which the populations of the continent
live lead to the prediction that the disease will stop invading
all the countries but remain endemic for an undetermined period,
because, among other reasons, there are serious problems in
basic sanitation in the countries and their solution in the
short or medium term is not foreseen.

2.2. Epidemiology of Cholera in the United States of America.

     From history it appears that cholera epidemics originated
in India and then spread to various countries.  In addition, it
is known that during the 18th century practically all the
countries of the world were at risk of suffering this disease.

     It is also known that the pathogenic action of Vibrio
cholerae serogroup 01 is expressed by the presence of a toxin
considered to be virulent and therefore the cause of disease and
epidemics, so that from the public health point of view the
appearance of vibriones without the two principal
characteristics of virulence (antigen 01 and the production of
toxin) is not significant.

     In addition, it should be remembered that an aquatic
environment is the normal habitat of V. cholerae.  It is capable
of remaining viable during indefinite periods in water and
marine environments; this means that it is ecologically
associated with plants and animals.  The organism produces
chitinase, an enzyme that destroys chitin, which makes the
association with shellfish possible, a common occurrence.

     Cholera infections produce no symptoms in 75% of the cases
and only from 15% to 23% present moderate symptoms.  In epidemic
situations, only 2% of the infections are life-threatening.

     In the United States, after 75 years without cholera, cases
were presented in 1973; they originated along the Texas coast,
caused by the bivalve mollusks that appear in the warm months. 
Recently, cases associated with travelers coming from countries
with epidemics have been observed, but no secondary cases have
been recorded.

     It is evident that the nonexistence of a cholera epidemic
after 1866 is due to basic sanitation activities, especially
related to the drinking water supply and to the organization of
health services within the reach of the entire population.  Even
if that "sanitary revolution" was to a great extent responsible
for the eradication of cholera in the United States, it does not
explain the concomitant disappearance of the disease in Latin
America in the 19th century.

     From 1866 to the beginning of the present century, only
sporadic cases of cholera have been reported in the United
States.  In this century, the first case was in 1973, where a
shrimp fisherman from the coast of Texas became ill with
diarrhea that was verified as cholera.  The primary source of
the infection was never found, but today it is known that it was
related to the strain of V. cholerae known as the strain from
the coast of the Gulf of Mexico.  That strain of toxigenic V.
cholerae 01 has persisted in the coastal waters of Texas and
Louisiana and has been responsible for several cases of cholera
through consumption of fish from that area, especially in the
summer months and at beginning of fall.

     In July and August 1991, toxigenic V. cholerae 01,
subsequently identified as the Latin American strain, was
isolated from oysters from the coast of Louisiana, but none has
been isolated since September.  It is suspected that the
contamination of the oysters on that coast was a consequence of
the discharge of ballast water from ships that had previously
sailed in contaminated waters in Latin America.

2.3. The Experience of the United States of America in Food
     Control in Response to the Cholera Epidemic in the
     Americas.

     The Food and Drug Administration of the United States, as
a government agency with responsibility for the protection of
the population, usually submits the food under its jurisdiction
to sampling and inspection when it is suspected that it poses
a risk to public health; however, food that complies with the
FDA regulations and is not considered a risk is permitted to
enter through simple arrang
