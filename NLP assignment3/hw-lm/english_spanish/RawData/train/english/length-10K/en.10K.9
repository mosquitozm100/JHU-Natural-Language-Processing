ut activities
     under their National Plans include the following:

     a)   Financing.  The main problems identified include:  (1) the economic adjustment
policies that have been implemented in the countries and the burden of external
debt payments;  (2) difficulties in estimating the cost of implementing the National
Plans in the medium and long terms; (3) shortfalls in the funds required to cover
the needs that have been identified; (4) failure to include in national budgets the
resources needed to attain the goals of the Summit. 

     b)   Information shortage.  Problems exist mainly in three areas:  (1) difficulty in
making a diagnosis on the basis of which to begin planning, (2) lack of up-to-
date information, and (3) absence of standardization and uniformity in
government and agency data. 

     c)   Limitations in terms of managerial capacity and experience.

     d)   Lack of coordination within the health sector and between the various ministries
and governmental agencies.


2.   Identification of Strategies for Improvement of the National Plans of Action


2.1  With regard to the enlistment of participation by the various sectors and by civil society
     in the countries' efforts to attain the goals set by the Plan of Action, most of the countries
     indicated that insufficient progress has been made. 

     In almost all the countries, support and political commitment have been obtained from
     the highest levels of government.  However, responsibilities have not always been clearly
     defined in terms of coordination and dissemination with other areas of government and
     other social sectors.

     There was consensus on the need to promote participation by society as a whole in
     order to create a collective consciousness that will support the effort and the actions
     aimed at attaining the goals of the Summit.

2.2  As for  the preparation of Plans of Operation for each of the components of the National
     Plan of Action, almost all the countries, after approving the National Plan, have taken
     steps to ensure intersectoral coordination, as well as comprehensiveness and
     complementarity.  The countries that have not yet prepared Plans of Operation are in the
     process of doing so.

     There was consensus on the desirability of making provision in the Plans of Operation
     for work at the municipal level in an effort to ensure regionalization and decentralization
     and to generate participation at the local level.

     The delegates agreed that the Plans of Operation are the basic instrument for launching
     the process of attaining the proposed goals and also for determining resource
     requirements.

2.3  Relative to the establishment of mechanisms for financing activities under the National
     Plan of Action, all the groups recognized the importance of identifying mechanisms that
     will guarantee adequate financing for the plans and programs.

     Most of the groups indicated that there have been demonstrations of budgetary support
     for activities in the area of maternal and child health.  However, only limited progress has
     been made in ensuring more rational use and optimization of the available resources.

     At the plenary session, it was recommended that steps be taken to simplify and
     streamline the slow and cumbersome process of gaining approval for projects and
     obtaining the first disbursement of funds.  Moreover, it was recommended that activities
     be implemented with a view to securing resources from bilateral agencies that provide
     technical and financial cooperation, as well as acquiring information about the areas of
     interest of such agencies and also of the countries and some NGOs that provide this
     type of collaboration.

     Several of the working groups expressed concern about the impact that external debt
     and structural adjustment policies would have on attainment of the goals established by
     the Summit.  In both the working groups and the plenary session, it was recommended
     that an effort be mounted not only to prevent budget cuts but to promote increases in the
     budgets of social welfare programs and the social sectors, particularly health and
     education.

     The participants agreed that it was crucial to identify financing mechanisms in order to
     attain the goals of the Summit.  In this regard, it was underscored that an effort must be
     made to:

     a)   channel government spending toward the health sector, especially areas that
were defined as priorities by the Summit;

     b)   identify other mechanisms of financing such as tax-related reforms, contributions
from the private sector, and funds from regional and local budgets; and

     c)   obtain external resources.

     It was recommended that the international agencies provide technical support to assist
     the countries in their search for financing, including mechanisms to improve efficiency
     and mobilize internal resources.

2.4  In regard to the establishment of mechanisms to follow-up on the National Plan of Action,
     it was considered extremely important to form a Commission to Follow-up and Monitor
     the National Plan in order to safeguard the advances made and indicate corrective
     measures when necessary.

     Very few countries have established a specific commission for this purpose, and it was
     recommended that the formation of such groups be promoted.

     On the topic of indicators, the plenary session recommended that the Governments
     endeavor to improve their information systems and update the existing statistical data
     in close collaboration with the agencies, with a view to establishing reliable, uniform, and
     timely baseline information that will make it possible to evaluate the progress toward
     attainment of the goals of the Summit.


3.   Preparation of the Plan of Work for the Period 1992-1995

     Most of the countries had difficulties in proposing a Plan of Activities for the period 1992-
1995.  The problems were mainly related to the failure to establish Plans of Operation for 1992,
weaknesses in intersectoral coordination, and the need to implement or strengthen certain
activities that are essential for the success of a medium-term plan.

     It was emphasized that it is essential to:  (a) increase the participation and commitment
of society as a whole, (b) prepare and implement Plans of Operation for each component of the
National Plan of Action, (c) establish the National Committees and the Interagency Coordinating
Committees as permanent bodies, (d) institute mechanisms to obtain financing and to follow-
up and monitor the National Plans of Action.

     The working groups proposed that subregional meetings be held for the purpose of
evaluating progress under the National Plans and facilitating the exchange of experiences.
Moreover, the Organizing Committee for the event was asked to seek mechanisms that will
make it possible to follow-up on the agreements and recommendations that came out of this
Meeting, as well as those that will come out of other similar gatherings to be held in the future. 

     The participants reaffirmed their commitment to doing their utmost to see that the goals
of the Summit are realized in their respective countries.

BOLIVIA


     In 1991 the Government succeeded in maintaining economic
stability, advancing measures to modernize the infrastructure of
the State, and promoting private capital investment.  Despite the
good results achieved in the country's economy, critical poverty
continues ravaging most of the population and the situation is
aggravated by unemployment, illiteracy, and high maternal and
child death rates.  The Government, recognizing the accumulated
social debt, continued applying a social policy which gives
priority to the health and education sectors and focuses on the
most vulnerable populations in the country.
     In PAHO/WHO cooperation during the year, major support was
provided to carrying out the National Survival, Child
Development, and Maternal Health Plan which the Government
implemented in 1990.  In that respect, activities were oriented
toward developing the infrastructure of the health services,
strengthening local health systems, priority personal health care
and environmental programs, and training health personnel to
carry out the Plan.
     Concerning development of the infrastructure, PAHO/WHO
cooperated in publishing basic documents for the process of
change and the new functions that the Ministry of Social Welfare
and Public Health plans to execute to carry on development of
local health systems, which are known as health districts.  Among
the documents disseminated was a manual on the standards and
procedures of the National Plan which emphasizes comprehensive
health care for women, children, schoolchildren, and adolescents.
     The collaboration given by the Organization to the
authorities charged with the National Bureau of Health Services
and at the managerial levels of the sanitary units and health
districts made it possible to increase technical and
administrative capacity at the national level and develop the
management process.  At the district level, local planning was
initiated with community participation and a guide prepared with
the collaboration of PAHO/WHO was implemented for comprehensive
planning and programming.  With the experience obtained in
implementing the information system of the Polyclinic Hospital as
part of the World Bank's institutional development project,
similar systems were implemented in Cochabamba and Santa Cruz
which have supplemented the health information subsystem.  This
subsystem was put into operation beginning in April in all the
health districts.  As part of the Comprehensive Health Project
financed by the World Bank, the Government, with th
