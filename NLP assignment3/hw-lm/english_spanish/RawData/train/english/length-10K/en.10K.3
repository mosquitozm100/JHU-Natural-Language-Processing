ncidence and geographical
distribution, and identify risk factors.  It also recommended
that ecological studies be undertaken to identify their
reservoirs, population dynamics, and biology to guide control. 
With financial support from the Organization, these studies are
being carried out at Yale University (USA) and the National
Institute of Hygiene of Venezuela.  Also with regard to viral
diseases, PAHO/WHO collaborated in a pilot study on vaccination
against hepatitis B in Peru, and in another on the feasibility of
producing a vaccine against Argentine hemorrhagic fever as well
as other vaccines in Argentina.
     The dengue situation in the Region continued to deteriorate
because of the increase in the density of the mosquito Aedes
aegypti.  In 1991, cases of dengue hemorrhagic fever were
recorded in Brazil, Colombia, Honduras, and Venezuela.  Only
Canada, the Cayman Islands, Chile, Costa Rica, and Uruguay can be
considered free from this vector.  The Organization cooperated in
Aedes aegypti control and surveillance with Brazil, Colombia,
Ecuador, Panama, Uruguay, Venezuela, and the countries of Central
America.  In addition, it prepared jointly with El Salvador,
Guatemala, and Honduras a trinational dengue control plan to
reduce the vector's density to levels which do not permit
transmission; strengthen epidemiological surveillance systems;
increase the response capacity of the general health services,
and achieve the participation of the population in preventing and
combating the disease.  It also promoted and organized an
international meeting to draw up guidelines for the dengue
prevention and control programs in the Americas, as well as a
meeting in Barbados to strengthen the information systems of
national Aedes aegypti control programs in which representatives
from the Ministries of Health of Martinique and Trinidad and
Tobago participated.
     With the collaboration of WHO's Parasitic Diseases Program,
it organized and carried out an informal consultation to define
regional guidelines for parasitic disease prevention and control
programs.  Finally, PAHO/WHO cooperated in rodent surveillance
and control activities in Anguilla, Dominica, Montserrat, and
Saint Lucia.
(Last part of chapter IV.E)
     Many activities to control sexually transmitted diseases
(STDs) were implemented, reflecting the Government's renewed
interest in halting the transmission of these diseases.
     At the scientific and technical level, the VIII Meeting of
the Latin American Union Against Sexually Transmitted Diseases
(ULACETS), held at Santo Domingo, served as a forum for
discussing STD laboratory needs as well as necessary
multidisciplinary support of medical and behavioral interventions
for STD control.  With PAHO/WHO's regional support, ULACETS
developed a protocol to implement the eradication of congenital
syphilis in Brazil and the Southern Cone countries.
     Treatment guidelines and simplified patient management
algorithms for sexually transmitted diseases were prepared and/or
distributed throughout the Region for use by specialists and
health providers at the primary care level.  Reviews of country
STD surveillance reports (Chile, Haiti, Uruguay), analyses of
country data on syphilis and gonorrhea available at the regional
level, and the training of professionals in epidemiological
surveillance at two subregional workshops set the stage for
improving STD surveillance in 1992.
     Finally, acknowledgement of the interaction between HIV
infection and other sexually transmitted diseases resulted in
additional regional efforts to strengthen control programs in the
Member Countries, notably in the Bahamas, the Dominican Republic,
Haiti, Jamaica, Martinique, and the Eastern Caribbean.





MATERNAL AND CHILD HEALTH PROGRAM
 PROGRAM FOR HEALTH PROMOTION/SUBPROGRAM ON THE
MENTAL HEALTH OF CHILDREN















ADVISORY GROUP FOR THE FORMULATION
OF A REGIONAL PLAN OF ACTION
FOR THE MENTAL HEALTH OF CHILDREN 

Montevideo, Uruguay, 4-8 November 1991















PAN AMERICAN HEALTH ORGANIZATION
WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION
ADVISORY GROUP FOR THE FORMULATION
OF A REGIONAL PLAN OF ACTION
FOR THE MENTAL HEALTH OF CHILDREN 






World Summit for Children


     

     In accordance with both the above commitment and the policies of the Pan American Health
Organization, the Organization, in conjunction with the Government of Uruguay and the Organization
of American States, convened an Advisory Group for the Formulation of a Regional Plan of Action on
the Mental Health of Children, which met in Montevideo at the Latin American Center for Perinatology
and Human Development during the week of 4-8 November 1991.  The following persons acted as
moderators of the Group:  Dr. M. Cherro, Director of the Clinic of Child Psychiatry, and Dr. R. E.
Bernardi, Professor of the Department of Medical Psychology of the School of Medicine of the
Universidad de la República, Montevideo.








     The objective of the meeting was to analyze the conceptual bases underlying the activities related
to promotion of the mental health of children and to the prevention and treatment of the emotional and
mental disorders that typically affect this age group; to analyze the most outstanding health and social
problems; and to propose a preliminary draft for a plan of action at the regional level.






     The meeting was initiated with remarks by Dr. R. Schwarcz, Director of the Latin American
Center for Perinatology and Human Development (CLAP), who welcomed the members of the
Advisory Group, expressed his thanks for the selection of CLAP as headquarters for the meeting, and
reiterated the support given by the Center to the work of the Group.

     Dr. V. Rathauser, Country Representative for Uruguay of the Pan American Health Organization,
officially opened the meeting and transmitted greetings to the Group on behalf of the Director of PAHO,
Dr. Carlyle Guerra de Macedo, who thereby made known his special interest in the subject area and his
willingness to support the Plan of Action formulated by the Group. 

     Dr. Rathauser pointed out that the initiative was the outcome of cooperation between two priority
PAHO programs, Maternal and Child Health and Health Promotion, which had joined efforts to deal
with an aspect of health that until the present time had been touched upon only tangentially by the
programs of PAHO:  the promotion of mental health and the harmonious development of children and
adolescents.  He further underscored the unique impact that a program of this type could have for the
future of the population and expressed his hope that the Group would find creative responses in this
field of major importance.

     Dr. I. Levav, PAHO Regional Mental Health Adviser, reported to the Group on the objectives
of the meeting, pointing out the importance of the deliberations for preparation of the preliminary draft
of the Regional Plan of Action for Mental Health of Children, which would serve as the principal tool
in the search for responses to the priority problems in this field.  The draft would be circulated among
the numerous parties involved in the Region who, in turn, would make suggestions for its enhancement. 
It was planned to convene a Regional Conference that would give final form to the proposed plan. 
Subsequently, national conferences would be convened which, after study of the Regional Plan, would
prepare the respective national plans of action.

     Dr. Levav noted that the Regional Plan should fill certain requirements that would ensure its
implementation and effectiveness, as follows: 

     a)   In consideration of the intersectoral nature of the mental health of children, the Regional
Plan should recommend activities whose execution would be the immediate responsibility
of:

-    the various health subsectors involved (Ministries of Health, social security, health
insurance, and other systems of prepaid health care, etc.) and the corresponding
programs and services (maternal and child health and health of the adolescent,
mental health, prevention and control of addiction,  health education, etc.);
-    the education subsector;
-    the various legislative bodies;
-    other sectors related to social policies;
-    nongovernmental organizations; and
-    international organizations, for example, PAHO/WHO, OAS, UNICEF, UNESCO,
etc.

     b)   A second requirement of the Regional Plan was the recognition that health and well-
being depend on the social, economic and, political conditions of the communities, which
may give rise to adverse situations that affect psychosocial development and result in
diseases and disorders of a biological, psychological, and social nature.  Special
importance should be assigned to examination of the evidence accumulated with regard
to these influences during preparation of the Plan.

     Dr. E. N. Suárez Ojeda, PAHO Regional Adviser in Maternal and Child Health, referred to the
Regional Plan of Action for the Promotion of Development and Growth in the Americas with which
the proposed Regional Plan for the Mental Health of Children would be closely associated.  In this
respect, he called attention to some of the regional health targets for the year 2000:  

     -    life expectancy at birth of more than 70 years;
     -    infant mortality rate lower than 30 deaths per 1,000 live births;
     -    preschool death rate lower than 2.4 per 1,000;
     -    vaccination coverage of 100% of children under one year of age; and
     -    universal access to health services, since adequate delivery care is one of the most easily
obtainable indicators.

     He referred to the World Summit for Children, held in September 1990, in which 150 countries
were represented and more than 70 Presidents and Prime Ministers attended.  In the meeting the
commitment was assumed of investing maximum efforts to strengthen promotion of the family and
ensure care for the psychological needs of children in especially d
