ation in environmental
and health matters in Central America.

Support for the V Meeting of First Ladies of Central
America on the subject of Environment and Development,
which was held at Managua from 18 to 23 November 1991.

From 13 January to 13 February 1992, MASICA accompanied
a Danish International Cooperation Agency (DANIDA)
mission through Central America whose objective was to
evaluate the "Occupational and Environmental Aspects of
Exposure to Pesticides" project which is currently in
the final phase of review by that Agency.

In the same way, another evaluation mission, this time
by the Swedish Agency for International Development
(ASDI), was accompanied by MASICA in its visit to
Central America from 29 March to 11 April 1992 in order
to evaluate another of its Projects, "Conservation of
Water Resources and Surveillance of Drinking Water
Quality in Central America."  The Agency agrees on the
importance of the topic, and it is now also in the
phase of final review of this important project.

The European Economic Community (EEC) has approved a
project prepared by the Environmental Health Program
(HPE/PAHO) and MASICA/PAHO relative to the control of
dangerous hospital refuse in the Region, which grew out
of the original "Management and Control of Solid Wastes
and their Effects on Health and the Environment/MASICA"
project.  The hospital refuse project will be carried
out mainly in bilateral form and it remains to be seen
what contribution MASICA/PAHO can make to its
execution.

During the third meeting of consultation with the
Nordic countries, the Finnish Cooperation Agency
(FINNIDA) showed some interest in MASICA's "Industrial
and Vehicle Contamination in Central America" project
but made clear that this year it cannot contribute to
carrying the Program out.

Informal conversations have been held with the Central
American Bank for Economic Integration (CABEI) about
the possibility of financing the "Evaluation of the
Impact on the Environment and Health of Development
Works (EIAS)" project since this type of practice is
being promoted by the Bank in its investment proposals.

A more detailed evaluation and new negotiations by the
Program with international agencies will be made during
the I Central American Conference on Ecology and Health
(ECOSAL I), which is being convened by the Ministers of
Health of Central America with the organizational
support of the Organization's Environmental Health
Program (HPE) and MASICA.  This important Conference,
the first of its kind, will be held in El Salvador in
mid-1992.





     The XII Meeting of the Special Subcommittee on Women, Health, and
Development of the Executive Committee was held at the Headquarters of the Pan
American Health Organization, in Washington, D.C., from 6 to 8 April 1992.  The
meeting was chaired by Dr. María Elena de Rivas of Honduras.  Mr. Burton Williams, of
Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, served as Vice Chairperson and Ms. Maritza Tamayo,
of Cuba, as Rapporteur.

     After presentation of the report of on technical cooperation activities, the
Subcommittee discussed the achievements that have been made and suggested that the
leadership role of the Regional Program on Women, Health, and Development should be
strengthened in order to facilitate introduction of the gender approach in the activities of
all technical cooperation programs within the Secretariat.

     The project "Comprehensive Health of Women in Central America" was discussed
and recognized to be a pioneering experience.  The Subcommittee recommended
continued promotion of the processes of co-management involving women's
organizations and health services at the local level and emphasized the need to find
alternative approaches.

     On the topic of women's health and self-care, the Subcommittee pointed out that
this initiative constituted a contribution toward the promotion of women's health and
toward the establishment of a real policy of participation by women in actions to foster
their development and improve their own health.  Recognizing the importance of the
subject, the Subcommittee recommended that further work be done to perfect the
conceptual framework and requested the Secretariat to prepare a proposal of Regional
strategies and concrete lines of action to develop this approach and increase understanding
thereof in the countries.

     Following presentation of the report on the situation of research on women, health,
and development, the Subcommittee endorsed the recommendations contained in the
report and suggested development of a policy to promote research in this area.  It
recommended that the Secretariat support the efforts aimed at presenting and publishing
health statistics with a breakdown by sex and that it promote the analysis of differences
as a means of encouraging research with a gender perspective.

     In response to the report on woman, work, and occupational health, the
Subcommittee pointed out the need for addressing this issue with a gender perspective. 
It was recommended that a special effort be made to promote research and provide a
breakdown by sex of the information that is obtained through surveillance systems in
occupational health.

     Finally, the Subcommittee took up the issue of the status of women within the
Secretariat, placing particular emphasis on the limited numbers of women in positions of
authority.  It suggested that the Secretariat undertake a closer study of the barriers that
limit the recruitment and hiring of women and report on its findings.

     The Executive Committee is requested to examine the report and make any
pertinent observations.  In particular it is asked to comment on the feasibility of the
recommendations made with regard to PAHO's technical cooperation program.

c) Exchange of Materials

Promotion of the production and exchange of educational materials between the
Centers.

d) Publication

Establishment of a scientific journal to disseminate and promote the results of

Background

     The food-borne diseases continue to be one of the greatest
problems that affect the health of the population of Latin
America and the Caribbean and are consequently a serious concern
of the governments and the health authorities of the countries. 
It is evident that the problem of the parasitic
