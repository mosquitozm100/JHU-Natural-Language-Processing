he selection process, observing that the
present scheme for filling regular posts within the Organization permits the
appointment of external candidates over qualified internal candidates, which leads
to staff dissatisfaction and demoralization and affects productivity.  The Staff
Association therefore requests the Executive Committee of PAHO to recommend
that the Administration monitor compliance with the rules governing the selection
process.


10.Meetings of FICSA and WHO Staff Associations
   
   Meeting of FICSA
   
The main issues discussed by the FICSA Council were:

   -  General Service Issues 
   
   Crucial issues are at stake for general service staff in 1992, particularly since
the International Civil Service Commission (ICSC) is reviewing the methodology
used to determine the salaries and pensions of the general service categories.  This
led the Federation to create a working group to study the proposals, with particular
attention to the technical and political aspects of the review, so as to safeguard the
conditions of service and the interests of general service staff.
   
   - Conditions of Employment in the Field
   
   The main issues discussed were the security measures implemented by the ad
hoc interagency commission and the problem of lack of job security for personnel
hired on short-term contracts in the field offices.
   
   - Professional Salaries and Remuneration
   
   The members of the committee on professional salaries and remuneration
firmly maintain that the loss in purchasing power of professional salaries must be
recovered, and they strongly oppose any freezing of salaries.
   
   - Staff-Management Relations
   
   Several members of the Federation reported that since the last Council meeting
the problems of previous years have diminished and favorable practices have been
instituted.  Several associations have had the opportunity to approach the Member
Governments, which have shown interest in staff issues. Some of the Executive
Directors have met regularly with staff, and there has been better response and
more information about staff problems.  Staff representatives have even been
invited to participate in the executive meetings of the Administration and have
been asked to help draft changes in personnel policies. 
   
   Meeting of WHO Staff Associations
   
   The meeting of the Regional Associations with the Association at
Headquarters in Geneva was held in February 1992.  The main issues discussed at
that meeting were:
   
   - Budget Reductions
   
   Concern was expressed about the impact of budget cuts on the financial
situation of WHO and its Regional Offices. Mr. Aitken (ADG) reported that the
reduction of the operating budget would result in certain necessary measures that
would affect certain posts within the ILO and several Regional Offices.  It was
reported that one Regional Office had already taken steps to reduce posts.  Among
the Regions immediately affected were the European and African Regions.
   
   The approximate projected deficit at the level of the ILO is $20 million, $9
million of which will be applied this year, with the remaining $11 million to be
applied subsequently either by freezing posts, some at the global level, or reducing
activities during 1992-1993, etc.
   
   The deterioration in dollar exchange rates and the failure by approximately 50
member countries to meet their quota obligations, combined with uncertainty over
payment by the former Soviet bloc, have been the primary causes of the crisis
situation now facing the Organization.  Preventive measures will undoubtedly be
taken, and these should include a contingency plan to be implemented
immediately, rather than forcible measures which would have more serious
repercussions.  The Staff Association requests that it be included in the discussions
on any substantial reduction in the budget before a final decision is made.
   
   Other matters discussed included:  reduction in force, personnel training, post
adjustments, and working conditions for professional and general service
categories.

PUBLISHED VERSION                                        24/IV/92

VENEZUELA


     Since 1989 the country has carried out a policy of promoting
non-oil exports, import substitution, saving public sector funds,
and utilization of external financing that has brought about
economic recovery, but this economic growth has increased social
inequality and caused an increase in poverty.  To mitigate this
situation, the Government initiated a policy of direct subsidies
through social programs.
     In the field of health, the Ministry of Health and Social
Welfare has established a System National Health Law and a
Jurisdiction Decentralization and Transfer Law, as well as
policies which promote upgrading of a basic sanitation system,
health education, strengthening of the primary care and hospital
system, malaria control, and labor peace.
     These laws guided PAHO/WHO's technical cooperation during
1991, which established a global strategy with four objectives: 
1) support for decentralization and strengthening of local health
systems by integrating technical cooperation adapted to the local
epidemiological profile; 2) collaboration with the central level
of the Ministry in formulating plans, policies, and standards to
carry out the process of integration; 3) technical cooperation
among countries in executing common plans, and 4) cooperation
with the agriculture sector by establishing a program to
eliminate foot-and-mouth disease and control paralytic rabies and
other zoonoses, with full social participation.
     The process of strengthening of local health systems, known
as "sanitary districts," which is carried out with the
Organization's technical cooperation, became the priority policy
of the Ministry in October to promote adoption of the primary
health care strategy and establish an interprogram approach to
solving problems at the local level.  During 1991 six sanitary
districts were created in different states, and at the end of the
year the country had a total of 15.  The "health in development"
component was also integrated into the process since the
organization of microbusinesses in local health systems is
promoted.  The development of pharmaceutical services in the
sanitary districts has not advanced as had been expected,
however, because of difficulties in operating capacity and
promotion at the central level.
     The dynamics of the projects and programs linked to manpower
development, which have PAHO/WHO's cooperation, resulted in the
organization of an interprogram group to promote
interinstitutional and intersectoral action, whose strategy
consists of making available information on institutions,
experts, and methodological proposals which can be utilized in
solving local problems to the chiefs of districts.  To develop
the epidemiological surveillance component in local health
services, the Organization collaborated with the national
authorities to increase the capacity of the senior personnel in
this field, which will make it possible to improve the use of
epidemiological surveillance and identify and solve problems
affecting the most vulnerable groups.
     In regard to adult health, activities were oriented toward
the local level.  Among this area's achievements was the
establishment of a program of integrated interventions in
promoting health and changing lifestyles to prevent chronic
diseases in the local health system of District 5 in Caracas, and
the preparation of a five-year plan of action to control cancer
of the cervix in the Chivacoa district of Yaracuy State.  A
national mental health plan was prepared and, following its
guidelines, a program in this field and another on gerontology
were included in the Quíbor sanitary district.  The restructuring
of psychiatric care also continued at the national level, and a
rehabilitation program was established in the Colón district
sanitary.  At the request of the Ministry of Health and Social
Welfare, a diagnosis was made of the traffic in and consumption
of psychoactive substances, and elderly persons were trained in
hydroponic cropping so that they can perform productive tasks in
their spare time.
     A new activity was the establishment of a social
communication program, coordinated by a journalist contracted
locally, in which all the consultants of the PAHO/WHO
Representative's office in the country participate.  This
program, mostly oriented toward the marginal urban population,
has national coverage and is disseminated through the social
communications media (press, radio, and television).
     In regard to nutrition, collaboration continued in
strengthening the Food and Nutrition Surveillance System (FNSS),
for which a manual on the computer program that will be utilized
at the district level was prepared.
     In the field of communicable disease prevention and control,
the Organization cooperated in preparing an integrated endemic
disease control project based on epidemiological stratification
which will be presented to the World Bank for financing.  The
schistosomiasis control program was strengthened through
serological diagnosis, and studies were sponsored on controlling
Aedes aegypti with community participation.  These studies
demonstrated that in most cases the leading cause of the high
index of Aedes aegypti infestation in dwellings was the presence
of deposits of water for consumption.
     The formulation of a project was initiated to promote
rehabilitation of leprosy patients and to link the programs to
control this disease with those dealing with tuberculosis.
     The III Pan American Teleconference on AIDS, which was held
in Caracas in March, was one of the most important achievements
in the national campaign against AIDS.  Other significant
activities carried out during the year were the incorporation of
educational programs to prevent and control disease in the
schools, the execution of national mass education campaigns
directed toward high-risk groups, the development of legal
instruments, and the improvement of a system of epidemiological
surveillance.
     With regard to environmental health, the existing
expectation of a cholera epidemic made it possible to improve the
system for surveillance of efficient water chlorination.
     Concerning growth, development, and human reproduction, the
Organization continued promoting the utilization of perinatal
clinical histories to determine the groups at greatest risk to
solve the problems they identified.  The diarrheal disease
control program established community oral rehydration units in
almost all the states of the country and continued training
personnel at the local level in controlling and preventing acute
respiratory infections and diarrheal diseases, breast-feeding,
and adolescent care standards.  There are managerial deficiencies
in the program, however, which did not allow their
decentralization and effective presence in the sanitary
districts.
     The most important achievements concerning immunization were
the absence of cases caused by wild poliovirus (after March
1989); the control and near eradication of neonatal tetanus; a
reduction in morbidity and mortality due to measles and whooping
cough, and the absence of confirmed cases of diphtheria for two
years.  In addition, surveillance of active case-finding of acute
flaccid paralysis and neonatal tetanus was improved, and in some
states the epidemiological investigation of measles was
initiated.
     Concerning veterinary public health, work was done with the
national program to eliminate urban rabies in the endemic areas
of Apure, Mérida, Táchira, and Zulia States, and preparation was
initiated of a program to eradicate bovine tuberculosis, which
together with those on paralytic rabies, brucellosis, and foot-
and-mouth disease will be presented to IDB for financing. 
Support was also provided for an epidemiological study of
leptospirosis in febrile patients, and at the end of the year a
test was made of the epidemiological surveillance system in
slaughterhouses. PAHO/WHO also continued sponsoring specialty and
master's degree courses in preventive veterinary medicine.
     Because of the cholera epidemic, there was collaboration
with the national authorities in making a diagnosis of the
hygienic-sanitary and food protection situation, studies to
analyze risks and critical points in controlling fresh fish and
cheeses were concluded, and a study was sponsored to characterize
morbidity and mortality due to diarrheal diseases, by sanitary
district, in Táchira State which will serve as a model for
guiding epidemiological surveillance of suspected cases of
cholera.  PAHO/WHO also cooperated in investigating outbreaks of
paralyzing shellfish intoxication and ciguatera in the
northeastern part of the country.
     In regard to the activities on women, health, and
development, a diagnosis of the mental health of women in
Venezuela was made, and two priority problems were selected: 
violence and early pregnancy.  A course was also given on
designing and preparing projects in the program on development
and promotion of women, and the strengthening of centers for
comprehensive care of women continued as part of the development
of the sanitary districts.
     With respect to technical cooperation between countries,
Venezuela, with the support of the Organization, expanded the
activities in a project on technology in dental biological
materials between Banta, Caracas, and Buenos Aires; it initiated
cooperation activities with Colombia, Cuba, and Ecuador, and it
began a project to strengthen and develop epidemiology in
marginal and indigenous areas along the Venezuelan-Colombian
border.

PRESENTATIONS AND CONCLUSIONS

     A summary of the discussions and conclusions on each item follows:

Item 4:                                                      Provisional Draft of the Program Budget of the World
Health Organization for the Region of the Americas for
the Biennium 1994-1995

     Mr. Milam, Chief, Budget Office, presented the item and summarized the
provisional budget proposal that will be submitted in June to the Executive
Committee and in September to the Directing Council, as the Regional Committee
for the Americas of the World Health Organization.  The Directing Council will
then make a final recommendation to the Director-General of WHO.  The global
proposal of WHO will be presented to the WHO Executive Board in January 1993
and to the World Health Assembly in May 1993.

     The tentative proposal for this Region, which amounts to $79,355,000, reflects
an overall increase of 11.0% with respect to 1992-1993.  This is the maximum
increase approved for this Region by the Director-General of WHO.  Because costs
have increased by 16.0% as a result of inflation and UN-mandated increases, it was
necessary to make program cuts amounting to $3,625,100, or 5.0%, including the
elimination of 14 positions.

     Owing to the drastic program decreases made during 1991 in the 1992-1993
program budget--which carry into the 1994-1995 projection--the proposal
presented in the document does not include the combined 5% increase that the
Director-General had called for in the following five priority programs:

     -          Managerial Process for National Health Development
-    Organization of Health Systems based on Primary Health Care
-    Nutrition
-    Promotion of Environmental Health
-    Disease Prevention and Control

A 5% increase in these five programs would have required a reduction of
approximately $5,500,000 in the other programs.

The Director pointed out that the proposal under discussion should be
considered provisional since it will be discussed and considered again by the
Subcommittee, as well as the Executive Committee and the Directing Council,
when they consider the joint PAHO/WHO budget for the period 1994-1995, about
which the secretariat will provide much greater detail.

   He noted that 1994-1995 will be the third consecutive biennium in which the
Organization will operate on the basis not just of zero growth but of negative
growth.  The increase in the budget is lower than the increase in estimated costs. 
Although costs are expected to increase by 16%, the proposed increase in the
budget is 11%, which implies a real reduction, in program terms, of 5% in the
WHO budget for the Region.  The cumulative effect of these reductions as of 1994-
1995 will be almost equal, in real terms, to one-third of the budget approved for
1988-1989.  This is one of the reasons why in this first draft proposal no attempt
was made to implement WHO/Geneva's instructions regarding a 5% real increase
in the five aforementioned programs, especially since these programs currently
represent 60% of budget expenditure for the Region and are therefore already
receiving sufficient priority.  To increase that 60% by 5% would have meant a
reduction of some 13% in other programs that are considered priorities in the
Region of the Americas.

   The Director asked the Subcommittee to give its guidance and opinions
concerning the tentative proposal while bearing in mind that the overall PAHO and
WHO proposal for 1994-1995 will be presented to the Governing Bodies in 1993.

   Discussion

   In the discussion that followed it was pointed out that, when the provisional draft
of the program budget is submitted to the Governing Bodies, it would be desirable
to include information that would make it possible to know and compare how other
Regions are handling and resolving the problem of increased costs, what
percentage is being al
