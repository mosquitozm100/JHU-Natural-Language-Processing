ental conditions and resources for health are peace, shelter, education, food, income, a stable
ecosystem, sustainable resources, social justice, and equity."

     In the Region of the Americas, in addition to deep inequalities both between and within the
countries, the deterioration in the economic situation has meant that larger numbers are living in relative or
extreme poverty.  Despite the considerable reduction in mortality that has been achieved in the last 35
years, mortality at early ages and morbidity and mortality due to diarrheal and acute respiratory diseases
and other communicable and preventable conditions continue to be major problems for many sectors of the
population.  In several instances, diseases that had declined significantly have now recrudesced, and there
have been epidemics and serious problems with communicable diseases such as cholera and AIDS, which
translate not only into violence and drug addiction but also into a deterioration in living conditions.16

     In the context of the world economic crisis, most of the countries of the Region have seen their
economies undermined and have had to resort to adjustment processes in an effort to combat inflation and
stimulate growth while at the same time seeking new windows through which to become integrated into the
international economy.  But the adjustment policies have served to aggravate the social, political, and
institutional breakdown which to a greater or lesser extent had begun to take place as far back as the
1970s.17,18  In most of the countries, public health services are degenerating, the public sector's per capita
expenditure on health is declining, and the limited and increasingly scarce resources are being
concentrated on curative actions.19  At the same time, within the framework of the adjustment policies,
significant changes have been introduced in the organization of these services, especially in how they are
financed, with a prevailing trend toward privatization and the transfer of operational costs to users.

     With support from international agencies, the governments have been devising intervention
strategies for sparing the most impoverished social sectors from the negative impact of the crisis.  In several
of the countries, social development funds have been created or are in the process of being created, and
almost all of them have begun to define social intervention programs aimed at the most vulnerable sectors. 
In an effort to minimize red tape and reach the population more directly, most of these programs have been
set up outside the traditional structures of the Ministries of Health using new, ad hoc institutions developed
by the official sector or nongovernmental organizations.  In some cases, part of the financing previously
allocated for official services has been diverted from traditional structures to support these new initiatives,
thus adding to the financial problems of the former.  Most of these emergency or social investment
programs focus on just a few lines of action and are directed toward a small number of specific problems in
the population groups that are considered to be most affected by the crisis.

     So far, there has not been enough knowledge or information available to document a correlation
between the deterioration in living conditions and health services coverage and quality, on the one hand,
and the health/disease problem, on the other.  As a result, the health systems have had only a limited role
in decision-making and the planning and evaluation of actions to promote health and well-being.  It is
therefore urgent that methods and techniques be developed that will measure the effect of the crisis on
different sectors of the population, identify the chief problems of these groups, and assess the impact of the
social responses.

     It is not enough to look only at the historical trends in living conditions and health at the national
level.  It is also necessary to evaluate the health of specific population groups, and, especially, to monitor
the patterns of inequality in different groups.  Moreover, it is essential to evaluate the impact of the actions
taken, in terms of units of time spent, for purposes of decision-making, so that the deployment of resources
and actions can be confirmed, or rechanneled, so as to achieve the greatest possible impact.  It is
becoming increasingly necessary to develop the capacity to evaluate change in the short term, to
supplement medium- and long-term trend assessments.

     It is more than just a matter of finding a "new" group of indicators with greater or lesser
discriminatory power to be applied universally to all population groups and in every country:  what seems to
be needed is an entire conceptual redefinition of the field of health, the incorporation of more appropriate
methodologies to capture the dynamics of the changes, and the development and application of techniques
for assessing the health situation which have not been widely used up to now.

     Accordingly, it has been decided to encourage the development of national systems to evaluate
and monitor health and living conditions in the different sectors of the population.  Such systems should
have the capacity to detect shifting trends and assess the impact of socioeconomic changes and
interventions for health and well-being on different groups of the population while at the same time
gathering knowledge on long-term trends.

     The study of inequalities in the health situation and their relationship to living conditions poses
major conceptual, methodological, and technical challenges that extend to the very concepts of health,
living conditions, and inequality, which have already been examined in a variety circumstances and
contexts.20,21,22  This will require a critical review of the different conceptual models that have been applied to
date, including the ecological model proposed by Morris23 and the models used by Blum,24 Lalonde,25
Dever26,27 and others.  It is time to move toward a reformulation within an integrative conceptual framework
that will operationalize the study of the health situation as part of the whole gamut of social processes that
generate living conditions in their different dimensions (biological, ecological, psycho-cultural, economic)28
and the different levels at which they are manifested (as individual, group, or societal phenomena), always
bearing in mind that a wealth of processes are involved.

     This entire undertaking--the reconceptualization of health in its relationship to the living conditions
of each population group; the redefinition of the units of analysis, the variables, and the relevant indicators;
and the articulation of the process of understanding the health situation with the processes of making
decisions and assessing the impact of interventions--raises issues of great epistemological complexity that
cannot be resolved by dealing with reality in compartmentalized and fragmented pieces and avoiding the full
theoretical construct.

     Different scientific disciplines have addressed the need to reduce complexity in their object of study
at the point where the cognitive and decision processes meet, and they have produced a number of
conceptual and methodological approaches such as the notion of hierarchical and nearly descomposible
systems,29,30 complex and poorly structured problems,31 and latent structure.32  In the area of research
methodology, renewed interest in the development of comprehensive methods has been translated into
tools such as methodological triangulation33,34 and data matrix systems,35 among others, which can be very
useful for the articulation of units of analysis, variables, and indicators of different levels and for the
integration of different quantitative and participatory methods within a single study.

     Finally, in order to facilitate the design of specific projects in the countries, it will be important to
enlist such techniques as the use of space-population units, which have been widely applied in geography
for the stratification of the population according to living conditions.  In addition, techniques based on the
concepts of sentinel populations and the tracing of problems and indicators, adapted to the needs of the
projects in each country, might help to increase the sensitivity of the surveillance system while at the same
time reducing the number of indicators and the operational costs.

     To facilitate the discussion and enrichment of these concepts, PAHO's Health Situation and Trend
Assessment Program has prepared a working document that summarizes many of the developments cited
here, based on which steps are being taken to promote specific operational proposals that are geared to the
national reality in each country.  The document is not prescriptive, nor is does it call for reaching a
consensus; rather, the hope is that it will contribute to the particular process in each country and facilitate
local cooperation by PAHO, based on a participatory approach, in the design of systems that are suitable,
viable, feasible, and capable of responding to the needs at stake in terms of national criteria.  In the first
attempts at this process, which have been limited to four countries so far, it has been possible to
incorporate the scientific and technical capacity of the institutions involved, which has been translated into
the particular characteristics of each undertaking and has considerably enriched the initial working
document while at the same time facilitating evaluation of the proposals in terms of their viability and
feasibility.

     It is hoped that this effort will be lead to relatively simple operational proposals, applicable to the
countries' particular conditions in terms of technical and financial resources, which can be turned into
ongoing activities by the institutions involved, complementing and strengthening the existing information
systems and closely tied to the decision-making processes at the point where the institutions of government
and civilian society interact.

CHOLERA IN THE AMERICAS

      For the first time in the current century, epidemic cholera
struck the Americas in January 1991.  During the past seven months,
over 270,000 cases have occurred in Peru, Ecuador, and Colombia,
with additional cases in Chile, Brazil, the United States of
America, Mexico, and Guatemala.  Although there has been some
decrease in the number of cases during the month of August, it
cannot be considered that the epidemic has subsided permanently. 
Since cholera will have epidemiological periodicity, other countries
can be expected to experience epidemics in future months and years,
and cholera may become endemic in some areas of the Region. 
Therefore, it is essential that all countries prepare for the
possible introduction of cholera by developing national plans for
cholera control.  Such national plans should include elements of
surveillance, crisis management, financial planning, case
management, epidemiological investigation, environmental sanitation,
food safety, health education, laboratory studies, and information
management.  

      PAHO should support the development and implementation of
national plans, prepare a plan at the Regional level, and identify
potential external resources for national and regional prevention
and control efforts.  

      The Organization has divided its response to the epidemic into
two phases:  the emergency phase, which will last three years, and
the investment phase, which will continue for 12 years.  It is
expected that US$ 610 million will be required during the emergency
phase to finance national plans and at least some subregional and
Regional activities.  During the investment phase, US$ 200 billion
will be needed in order to correct deficiencies in the environmental
and health infrastructure that have contributed to the spread of
cholera.  The countries will need to provide a significant share of
the resources, with the remainder to be requested from international
organizations.  As of mid-August, PAHO had participated in the
mobilization of more than US$ 12 million, which were donated by
various countries, the European Community, and the Inter-American
Development Bank (IDB).  The Organization is discussing projects
with other organizations, since there is an obvious need to rapidly
mobilize additional financial resources.

      Discussions during the Meeting of the Executive Committee
Meeting focused on the role of national cholera control commissions,
alternative strategies for dealing with the problem, the
prioritization of studies on new vaccines, the desirability of
strengthening diarrheal disease control, the importance of public
information, ways to encourage community involvement, the need to
report and share information on the problem, control actions, and
the amount required for investment in the immediate future.  As a
result of these discussions, the document presented to the Executive
Committee (see Annex) has been revised to clarify the role of the
national commissions, underscore the importance of supporting the
new vaccine studies, point out the need to step up programs for the
control of diarrheal diseases, and emphasize the importance of
public information and community involvement.  Updated information
has also been added with regard to the epidemic and the status of
resource mobilization.

      Resolution XI, adopted by the Executive Committee and included
below, suggests a draft resolution that encompasses the policies
proposed for consideration by the Council.  Members of the Directing
Council are asked to review this document for purposes of
discussion, decide on the policies to be implemented, and provide
guidance for the Secretariat and recommendations for the countries.CD35/20

I.    HISTORICAL BACKGROUND

      Most countries of the Americas were affected by the second
through the fifth pandemics of cholera that spread widely between
the 1830's and the 1890's.  Fortunately, the Americas were free of
epidemic cholera for the first 90 years of this century, which has
been attributed, at least in part, to the installation of water
treatment in virtually all major cities of the Americas beginning at
the turn of the century.  Water filtration was widespread by 1870
and chlorination by 1910.  The Americas succeeded in being the only
region free of cholera during the first 30 years of the seventh
pandemic, which began in Indonesia in 1961 and reached much of the
world during its first 10 years, including West Africa in 1970. 
Cholera spread rapidly through Africa from 1970 to 1973 and has
remained endemic in several countries since then.   Epidemics also
occurred in Italy, Portugal and Spain in the 1970's, but cholera was
eliminated from these countries
