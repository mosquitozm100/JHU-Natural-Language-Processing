mmittee of the Chamber of Representatives attended the Meeting
of Parliamentarians of the Southern Cone held at Brasília
simultaneously with the Meeting of Ministers of Health of the
subregion.  Subsequently equipment and programs as well as
technical information and material on health legislation from
several countries were facilitated for the Congress.
     Concerning prevention and control of noncommunicable
diseases, the new authorities decided on four programs as of
maximum priority:  cardiovascular disease prevention and control,
breast cancer, traffic accidents, and the health of the elderly. 
PAHO/WHO collaborated with the Ministry of Public Health in
formalizing some of these programs; in disseminating their
messages to the population, and in holding a second seminar
workshop on social communication and health, based on the
excellent reception and promising results of the first seminar
workshop carried out in May 1990.
     With regard to veterinary public health a consultant of the
Pan American Institute for Food Protection and Zoonoses (INPPAZ)
gave a seminar on hydatidosis during the South American Congress
of Parasitology held at Montevideo in November in which many
technicians in the national campaign against this disease
participated.  The country signed a subregional agreement on
foot-and-mouth disease eradication, a goal reaffirmed in the
MERCOSUR agreements.  As a result of that agreement, PANAFTOSA
cooperates with the national authorities in the surveillance
activities which are carried out in the country.  In the last
months of the year no cases were detected, which leads to the
assumption that the first phase of foot-and-mouth disease
eradication has begun in Uruguay.
     Concerning technical cooperation between countries, a
meeting was held in Montevideo in November of representatives of
the Southern Cone countries, Cuba, Mexico, and Venezuela to draw
up joint projects related to the exchange of technology; the
meeting was convened by the Latin American Economic System (LAES)
and PAHO/WHO.
     The national campaign against AIDS and sexually transmitted
diseases continued receiving broad cooperation from PAHO/WHO. 
During the year a medium-term plan was formulated; an
Interministerial Commission on AIDS was designated, and
departmental coordinators were appointed; health personnel were
trained in workshops, and 1,250,000 condoms donated by WHO's
Global Program on AIDS were distributed.  During the III Pan
American Teleconference on AIDS, which took place at Caracas in
March, more than 1,000 professionals in the field of health met
in the rooms of the Municipal Government of Montevideo.  PAHO/WHO
coordinated a knowledge, aptitude, and practice survey and
collaborated in a study of seroprevalence of 1,351 persons in
sentinel sites.  World AIDS Day educational activities were
characterized by greater participation of the population in the
interior of the country and by the distribution of more than
300,000 informative pamphlets.  Uruguay inspects almost 100% of
the blood donated for transfusions to prevent HIV infection. 
With PAHO/WHO support, a national workshop was held in April on
diagnosing infection due to HIV in public laboratories and blood
banks.  The national program on AIDS produces and disseminates an
epidemiological bulletin of national scope every month.
     Concerning growth, development, and human reproduction, the
Maternal and Child Health Department, with the support of CLAP,
promoted early care for pregnant women and established standards
for neonatal control; the national maternal and child health
program adopted CLAP's clinical history model.  In addition
activities were carried out to prevent and control acute
respiratory infections and diarrheal diseases.  The beginning of
a system of epidemiological surveillance of diarrheal diseases in
adults, and the task of promotion and dissemination directed
toward the prevention and control of cholera should be noted.  In
this field various forms of mass communication were tried, and
the authorities responsible for preventing cholera participated,
with support from the Organization, in the meeting on the subject
held at Washington, D.C.  The high coverage achieved by the
Expanded Program on Immunization (around 90% and more) is
noteworthy; however, because of an outbreak of measles which
mostly affected children under the age of 1 year and older than
12, the measles immunization timetable was modified.
     Finally, with respect to adolescent health, an investigation
of adolescent reproductive health was made with the support of
UNFPA and PAHO/WHO and workshops and seminars on the subject were
held.  In addition a course on sex education was offered for 50
secondary school educators sponsored by the Ministries of Public
Health and of Education and Culture, and a book on sex education
whose first edition was exhausted during the year was reprinted.
     Jointly with the national authorities, the Organization in
1991 structured PAHO/WHO's cooperation activities in the country
for 1992 according to the national priorities and the mandates
from the Governing Bodies of the Organization.

        PROGRAM ON EYE HEALTH, PAHO 1991-1992


1.   Introduction:

The program on eye health initiated its activities in 1991 with a new approach to
     the promotion of eye health through education, information, and social communication.

The program has provided support to the Member Countries for the development
     of programs for eye health and prevention of blindness as part of the strengthening of the
     local health services through primary eye care.

2.   Analysis of the General Policies in Force:

a.   The importance of this program is reflected in resolutions WHA22.29 (1969) and WHA
     25.55 (1972) of the World Health Assembly, which led to the establishment of the WHO
     program for the prevention of blindness.

b.   In the XXXIV Meeting of the Directing Council, 1989, and by recommendation of the
     Executive Committee the same year, it was resolved to urge the Member Governments to
     continue to strengthen their eye health policies and programs, placing emphasis on the
     development of simple technologies for diagnostic prevention, treatment, and
     rehabilitation.  PAHO is committed to collaboration in research, training of personnel, and
     implementation and evaluation of national programs for blindness prevention and the
     promotion of eye health.

Furthermore, taking into account Resolution XVI of the XXIII Pan American
     Conference, the 107th Executive Committee resolved to recommend to the XXXV
     Meeting of the Directing Council the decision to eliminate certain communicable diseases
     such as onchocerciasis.


Activities 1991

     First Four-month Period

The regional adviser on blindness prevention was named, who traveled to the Ninth
     Meeting of the WHO Advisory Group on Blindness Prevention, which was held in Banjul,
     Gambia, in March.

During this first four-month period the regional adviser also had the opportunity
     to participate in the first Inter-American Conference on Onchocerciasis, which discussed
     the multinational plan for elimination of the disease.


     Second Four-month Period

As part of the mobilization of resources through the identification of national and
     international resources, correspondence was established with the NGOs, PWRs, Pan
     American Association of Ophthalmology, and the WHO Collaborating Centers.  Visits
     were made to the Director of the National Eye Institute, to the Executive Director of the
     International Eye Foundation, and to the Director of Helen Keller International.

With regard to the dissemination of information an informational outline was
     prepared on PAHO programs for the promotion of eye health and the prevention of eye
     disease.  This outline was published in the August 1991 edition of the Noticiero
     Oftalmológico Panamericano of the Pan American Association of Ophthalmology.

As part of the development of policies, plans, and standards, a report was made on
     the current state of the AGFUND project that was accompanied by a plan of action for the
     project.  It is hoped to obtain additional funds with this plan of action.

The plan of action of the eye health program for the following four years was also
     developed.

In the program for the elimination of onchocerciasis,  contact was established with
     two groups in Colombia in order to develop the program.  The interaction and
     interprogram cooperation have been outstanding.

With regard to direct technical advisory services, a visit was made to Paraguay, an
     evaluation of the program was made, the human resources were identified for developing
     cataract surgery, and a national committee was established for the prevention of blindness.

     The visit to Haiti had to be canceled by as a result of changes in the Ministry of Health.

A visit was made to the Sanitary Ophthalmology Service of Sao Paulo in Brazil to
     visit the Collaborating Center and to participate in the Seminar on the Prevention of
     Blindness in Joinville in the State of Santa Catarina.

     Third Four-month Period

As part of the mobilization of resources through strengthening of the ties with the
     NGOs, there was participation in the meeting organized by ONCE and Sight Savers in
     Madrid, and collaboration was requested from these organizations for the development of
     eye health programs in the Region of the Americas.

The Inter-Agency Coordinating Group for Eye Care in the Caribbean did not invite
     us to participate in the Caribbean Council for the Blind this year.

Dissemination of information:  During the Congress of the Pan American
     Association of Ophthalmology and the American Academy of Ophthalmology that was
     held in Anaheim, California, the programs on Health Promotion and Eye Health organized
     a working breakfast in which reports were made on eye health programs in the Region to
     a group of 25 ophthalmologists from 15 countries in the Region.  It is hoped to establish
     an information network and to execute regional programs with this group. 

A pamphlet was produced on the Program on Eye Health and Blindness Prevention
     that was distributed during the meeting in Anaheim.
     
With respect to the organization and transformation of the services, a follow-up was
     performed of the National Plan for Blindness Prevention in Peru and there was
     participation as guest of honor in the National Congress for Blindness Prevention.
     
Projects were developed to mobilize resources such as the use of mass
     communications for the promotion of eye health in Peru, Colombia, and Brazil.

An investigative project titled "Prevention of Blindness in Diabetic Retinopathy"
     was presented to the PAHO Internal Research Committee. 
     
With regard to direct technical advisory services, a visit was made to Bolivia in
     order to provide technical cooperation and perform a follow-up of the AGFUND project.


Activities by Country, 1991

A.   Follow-up was performed on the AGFUND project in the following countries:  Belize,
     Bolivia, El Salvador, Guyana, Haiti, Nicaragua, Honduras, and Paraguay.  A report was
     made on the project, additional resources were requested, and the national authorities were
     urged to continue the project.  As a result, all the countries involved expect to continue to
     develop the project, and Belize, El Salvador, Honduras, and Bolivia have showed their
     interest in receiving a visit from the regional adviser in 1992.

B.   Centers or institutions of technical excellence and with interest in the development of
     national eye health programs were identified as part of a regional network of institutions
     sharing this common interest.  The following countries were included:  Bolivia, Ecuador,
     Uruguay, Venezuela, Brazil, Chile, Peru, Mexico, Colombia, Paraguay, Guatemala,
     Argentina, and El Salvador.  The institutions mentioned have the capacity to support the
     secondary and primary care programs in the various countries and to become disseminators
     and promoters of the techniques of primary eye care.  As a result, great interest has been
     awakened in public, mixed, and private organizations in developing eye health programs
     characterized by the profile and the general guidelines outlined in the regional plan of
     action.

C.   A visit was made to Mexico and Guatemala as a participant in the First Inter-American
     Conference on Onchocerciasis, which outlined the regional plan for elimination of the
     disease and from which Mexico, Guatemala, Colombia, Venezuela, Brazil, and Ecuador
     are benefiting at the present time.

A visit was made to Paraguay and the national program was evaluated.  Solutions
     to the problems that were brought up were identified, thereby providing an impetus to the
     program.

In Peru there was participation in the Fourth National Congress on Blindness
     Prevention in support of the actions this country has been carrying out. 

In Brazil a visit was made to the Collaborating Center for Blindness Prevention and
     there was participation in the Eye Health Regional Seminar in the State of Santa Catarina.

D.   The Program on Social Communication and Eye Health is being launched in Peru,
     Colombia, and Brazil.  The benefits of the program will be evaluated once it has been
     implemented.



Activities 1992

3.   First Four-month Period:

     Social communication projects were prepared in order to promote eye health in Colombia
and Brazil.  A similar project was initiated in Peru. 

     There has been participation in the organization of a workshop for ophthalmological
evaluation of onchocerciasis, which will be held in Guatemala in July 1992.

     Advisory services have been provided for the multinational and interagency plan to
eliminate the disease in Colombia, Ecuador, Brazil, and Venezuela.  A visit was made to
Guatemala and Mexico together with the NGOs.

     There was participation in the mounting of a subregional network of national committees
for blindness prevention in Saint Lucia, Dominica, St. Vincent, and Grenada, organized by the
CCB and ORBIS.

     Projects for blindness prevention were presented by five countries (Bolivia, Colombia,
Ecuador, El Salvador, and Paraguay) to ONCE for consideration for financing.

     A meeting of coordinators of the AGFUND project was organized for blindness prevention
with the participation of seven countries (Bolivia, Paraguay, Nicaragua, Honduras, El Salvador,
Belize, and Guyana) in which projects were discussed that have been being developed since 1985. 
Very valuable information was obtained on strategies of great impact as well as on those without
impact.  The conclusions were presented at the regional level in order to be submitted for analysis
and for necessary adjustments for future actions.

     A survey on ophthalmia neonatorum was designed, prepared and sent.  

     Information has been distributed on eye health through the regional information network. 

     A manual on eye health for workers is being published. 

     Johns Hopkins University and the University of Chile are being supported in research on
the effects on the eye of exposure to UV rays due to the depletion of ozone in the extreme south
of Chile.

WORKING DOCUMENT

PRE-PROPOSAL FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF A
PAHO COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEM

1.   BACKGROUND

     In the course of its history, the Organization has developed
various mechanisms for the formulation and establishment of
operating standards, guideline
