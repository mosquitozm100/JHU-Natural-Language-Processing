a means to an end (for example: to
obtain gains by working in this area), and still others will
view health as the object of their institutional mission (for
example: sectoral public institutions).  Beyond the different
essential approaches, the way in which health problems are
broached and managed will also depend on a variety of
determinants and conditions are rooted in cultures, beliefs,
knowledge, and other dimensions which broadly and generically
may be regarded as ideology.

     The intricate web of actors and interests calls for a
strategic approach, and in particular it call attention to
the need to build a process of leadership throughout the
entire health care process.  Thus leadership, agreement,
negotiation, cooperation, and consensus are notions that are
central to LSA.  The leadership phase therefore assumes a
protagonism that is lacking in the approaches referred to as
normative planning.

     How should leadership be provided?  Who should lead? 
Based on what interests or agreements is leadership
established?  How is leadership built?  Who are the actors
that participate in the steering process?  These are some of
the questions that take on fundamental importance when it
comes to characterizing LSA.  These are the questions that
always call for decision-making on the part of the actors
involved in the process--decisions that will depend on the
configuration of power based on the relations between the
actors and therefore cannot be determined a priori.

     In any case, given the magnitude of the task being
undertaken, it is impossible to pose the issues from all
perspectives.  Accordingly, henceforth only one perspective
will be adopted, namely that of the actors in the State
health organizations, and specifically those in sectoral
agencies.  It should be made clear that this focus on the
State subsector is in no way intended to rule out or
subordinate the other actors in the process.  It merely
recognizes the dimension that predominates in the
institutional setting in which this analysis is being carried
out.

     The programming phase encompasses all activities that
have to do with foreseeing the courses of action to be
followed.  Programming should not be merely a ritual that is
the responsibility of a single institutional actor, usually
the State.  Rather, it should involve all the actors that are
in a position to plan their actions for the attainment of
their objectives, which is different  their actions for the
achievement of their objectives.  What will differ is the
level of formalization achieved.  However, for reasons
already indicated, the description will correspond, in its
first approximation, to the perspective of the public health
subsector.

     The programming phase ranges from the identification of
health problems to the design of the actions and activities
considered necessary for attaining the goals proposed. 
Throughout this process, leadership will be a fundamental
element in obtaining the consensus needed in order for the
different actors to join efforts in working toward the agreed
objectives.

     The explanation of the health situation, which involves
the use of information and the evaluation of processes and
results, is provided by each of the actors in terms of their
interests and specific perspectives.

     In particular, in the area of public institutions, the
identification and explanation of problem situations is
predominantly done by specialists from every particular
branch of health knowledge.  This activity should lead to
the formulation of options as a basis for determining
priorities for intervention.

     It should be borne in mind that the identification of
problems in this context implies, if the channels of
communication with other actors are to be kept open, clearly
stating the knowledge available and being utilized in
presenting and solving problems that are detected, given the
fact that they are part of the culture of one of the actors
and do not necessarily represent a consensus.

     Agreements in these areas will make it possible to
determine which resources or technological tools should be
available for solving the problems in each specific situation
and for promotion, prevention, diagnosis, treatment, and
rehabilitation, as well as those that are not provided for as
part of health services for individuals--including
environmental health, manpower planning, and the creation,
maintenance, and recovery of physical resources.

     For this reason, it is essential to identify or recognize
the relationship between problems and causes, and between
problems and the resources needed for their solution, at each
of the levels and in each area under consideration.

     These different types of information will make it
possible to strike a balance, at the local level, between
needs and existing resources in terms of quantity and
response capacity, which in turn will guide the determination
of different possible courses of action for solving problems
as well as the steps necessary for their implementation based
on the priorities set.

     In order to carry out the activities planned,
consideration needs to be given to the application and
utilization of methods, techniques, and procedures for
managing and administering the resources required in order to
solve problems and respond to demands.  Consideration should
also be given to the areas of monitoring, surveillance,
supervision, and evaluation, determining which indicators
could be used in the process and the outcomes thereof,
depending to the problem and the level of intervention.  The
activities required in order to carry out the foregoing
correspond to the management phase.

CHAPTER III

   LEADERSHIP IN LOCAL STRATEGIC ADMINISTRATION 

     1.-   CHARACTERISTICS OF THE LEADERSHIP PROCESS 

      LSA takes place in a scenario that is characterized, at
any given moment, by the configuration of relationships
between the various actors in the society--relationships that
are established in the midst of tensions between the actors. 
This means that local health systems, as social systems, are
enmeshed in environments characterized by conflicts of
interest, power struggles, institutional fragmentation, and
uncertainty as to the outcome of any actions that are carried
out.

      Thus there is justification for emphasizing a strategic
approach and for recognizing the importance of leadership. 
In particular, in the process of leadership in LSA, care must
be taken to:

    * recognize and deal with pluralism, multiple choices,
      negotiation, uncertainty, conflict, fragmentation,
      dependency, and complexity;
    * take into account and integrate, as well as analyze and
      address, existing social, political, economic, and
      cultural contexts;
    * consider and recognize the component elements in the use
      and distribution of political, administrative, and
      technical power;
    * continuously relate the short term to the medium and
      long terms;
    * consider consensus, agreement, and negotiation as
      fundamental instruments for making proposals viable;
    * seek to create the conditions necessary for extensive
      participation by all the involved social actors and
      groups;
    * relate and evaluate normative and strategic
      considerations.

    2.-    STEERING AND LEADERSHIP IN LOCAL HEALTH SYSTEMS

      Since in most of the countries of the Region the
operating capacity of the health system is under the
authority of the Ministries of Health, or their national
equivalents, the maintenance of control by these institutions
over that capacity and the achievement of maximum efficiency
and effectiveness are the strategic keys to establishing
leadership in the system.

      Increased efficiency in the networks of services,
including hospitals, should be accompanied by a
democratization of the steering process, allowing for social
participation in the service-providing units and in each of
the control/information/decision-making levels into which the
networks are organized.  In this connection, the
decentralization of institutional management, which leads
toward social control of management, should be accompanied by
a strengthening of the capacity for leadership of the system
within the decision-making spheres where national policies
are mapped out.

      Leadership, programming, and management in this context
necessitate development of the capacity to administer and
negotiate complex and conflictive processes; monitor
privileged social groups and control the health system in
accordance with concerted strategy; and adjust, orient, and
control external assistance, which in crisis situations can
become essential, at times with negative side effects.  All
of this requires highly developed strategic leadership.

      Leadership in the sectoral organs of government will
emerge as the process evolves, but this can happen only to
the extent that they gain credibility in the eyes of society
and the government in general.  Such credibility develops as
a result of concrete actions in their respective areas of
responsibility and through democratization of the system at
its various levels.  According to the concepts and notions of
strategic administration, leadership becomes apparent when
there is a situation of crisis that threatens institutional
survival and at the same time there is a strategic argument
that suggests a way of getting around the perceived threat.

      Because leadership involves an ongoing process of
negotiation from an unstable position of authority, it is
possible to expect that authority will be achieved by gaining
credibility and, consequently, the capacity for negotiation,
concerted action, and monitoring through the design and
administration, in conjunction with civil society, of
effective actions that will mobilize all actors in the health
system according to their spheres of action and effective
capacity.  These actions with regard to the short term must
be carefully considered, implemented, and reviewed so they
can yield to long-term actions that will constitute the
contribution of the health sector to higher standards of
living and fewer inequities, as an integral part of the
development of a national project of democratic coexistence
that will transcend immediate political/administrative
management concerns.

      The determination of institutional jurisdiction over
leadership and coordination of the process is a necessary
condition for the subsequent development of activities. 
Indeed, this can be seen as the first step in the
establishment of a local health system.

      The local health system should lead the process of
negotiation and agreement between the various social actors
that coexist in the local jurisdiction (public and private
subsectors, social security institutions, NGOs, social
groups) and take the initiative in the process of
programming, with the participation of those responsible for
the services, members of the local health teams, and social
groups.  This process must receive sustained support from the
regional and central levels of the health system.

      An important aspect within the organization of
leadership is coordination.  This can take the form, for
example, of a collegiate body with representation from
sectoral and extrasectoral institutions and social groups or
a working group established by the appropriate
political/administrative authority.  The degree of
development achieved by the social actors and groups involved
in the local health systems will determine the level of
complexity and formality attained in the organization of
administration and coordination.

      While the role of those who assume responsibility for
leadership cannot be ignored, it is important to emphasize
that this process does not take place in a vacuum. 
Leadership occurs in a specific society and situation, which
means it is essential to recognize that society (i.e., the
actors and social groups that form it) should carry out a
basic function:  the exercise of social control over the
system.  Monitoring and strategic evaluation should occur in
every local health system in order to ensure that social
participation is not reduced to its caricature form:
community participation as cheap or free labor to meet the
demands and needs of specialists and technicians in the
sector.

    3.-    RELATIONSHIP OF THE LOCAL HEALTH SYSTEM TO OTHER
POLITICAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE LEVELS OF THE HEALTH
SYSTEM

      The process of developing and strengthening a local
health system requires a guiding principle expressed in the
form of policies and various strategic alternatives that can
be used to make them viable and feasible.

      Policies for the development and strengthening of the
local health system should be consistent and congruent with
overall policies for development of the national health
system, since the local health systems are part of this
system, not independent and isolated units.

      Because the local health system is located in a
geographical area (and is responsible for the population
living in it) that is or is part of a political subdivision
of a territory, strategies for developing and strengthening
the system should be designed in light of the models of
political, administrative, economic, and sociocultural
behavior that characterize the region where it is located and
the modalities or styles of articulating their administration
within the corresponding local government.

      At the same time, the local health system is part of a
whole whose other levels of organization also have defined
and important roles in its leadership, programming, and
management.

      These other levels of organization--the intermediate or
regional and the national levels--should program their
support and functional articulation with the local health
system.

      The intermediate level assembles and analyzes the
requirements defined by the administrative entity of each of
the local health systems operating in the regional area, and
originates:

      - recommendations in regard to the adjustments needed to
      place these requirements within administrative and
      financial guidelines, adapting them to any budgetary
      ceilings and technical standards for the operation of
      physical resources in the health care field (physical
      plant, facilities, and equipment) and for
      recommendations for responding to health problems;
      - regional programs, timetables, and budgets;
      - demands that will be channeled to the national level.

      The national level brings the demands of the regions
into line with the standards, guidelines, and procedures of
the sector, carrying out in its sphere the same procedures as
those that fall to the regional level.  With regard to this
adaptation, the same considerations pertaining to demands
should extend to the appropriate international or
multinational agencies.


    4.-    THE IDENTIFICATION OF HEALTH PROBLEMS
    4.1.-  Conceptualization of Health Problems
    
      From the perspective of the health system, a problem or
problem situation can be said to exist when one or more
indicators deviate negatively from the values considered to
be acceptable or desirable.  The definition of the indicator
as well as its "acceptable" or "normal" values is context-
specific and should be determined in each individual area in
accordance with the objectives pursued.

      For those who carry out the evaluation, the negative
distance between the actual situation and what was expected
or desired, when properly measured, is a first indication of
the magnitude of the problem.  However, the problem, from a
social perspective, is always associated with the values,
needs, and expectations of some social group.  Thus the
definition established by the health system must be analyzed
in light of the definitions of other actors in order to
arrive at a concerted interpretation of sectoral problems. 
However, given that a problem manifests itself at a specific
time, its definition, and the assignment of priority to it,
is an ongoing process with neither a beginning nor an end.

      In reality, it is impossible to speak of or treat health
problems as if they were isolated occurrences.  Social
problems form complex and related systems that are mutually
conditioned and determined.  Identification of one of them
does not imply automatic identification of the system to
which it belongs.  Taking this into account and given the
power of the instruments of intervention that are available,
it is necessary to identify the greatest number of problems
and their components, as well as the systems to which they
belong, in order to be able to specify their causes and
determine the best interventions, based on available
knowledge and resources.

      On the basis of these reflections it is possible to
state the conditions that must be met in order to be able to
identify a health problem or set of problems. 

    - Define the characteristics of the phenomenon or
      situation that is considered normal or desirable. 
      Whenever possible this definition should consider the
      establishment of indicators, both qualitative and
      quantitative, that make it possible to identify problems
      in different areas;
    - Specify known causes of the phenomenon and, whenever
      possible, the characteristics of these causes that might
      be associated with various degrees of magnitude of the
      phenomenon or process;
    - Identify the social groups for which different values of
      the indicators define a problem.


    4.2.-  The Identification of Priorities and Assumption of
Commitments

      Priority expresses the order of importance of health or
health-related problems.  The term commitment, on the other
hand, expresses a political content, a responsibility for
guidance in order to ensure the implementation of a political
process aimed at achieving the desired objectives.

      Priority and commitment define an area of negotiation in
which the local health system leadership should seek to
ensure that the resources for solving health problems are
adequately balanced with those allocated for other sector
projects aimed at achieving more immediate political
purposes.  In other words, health should acquire political
importance. 

      The definition of priority problems and their acceptance
as political commitments brings up a two-fold consideration-
-who makes the decisions, and how and by whom are resources
assigned? 

      The identification and selection of priorities for
action are carried out in relation to the main problems
detected in health, the epidemiological factors that
condition or determine their appearance, and the population
groups at greatest risk of being affected by them, as well as
the technologies required to solve them and the assessment of
the various technical options available based on the
anticipated cost/benefit ratio. 

      In this process, the participation of all involved
actors is essential.  It is in the local area that the
promotion of social participation mechanisms can be most
successful and can bring about, in the most spontaneous,
creative, and integrated manner possible, the generation by
social groups of ideas, explanations, and solutions to deal
with problems.

      Each of the three levels of leadership (national,
regional, and local) has the authority to assume commitments. 
The national level, for example, makes international
commitments, hence the decisions to eradicate wild
poliovirus, establish a global AIDS program, extend coverage,
etc.  The intermediate level enters into regional commitments
within a country or commitments with regard to borders
between countries for the solution of common problems.  The
local level makes commitments for the solution of health
problems and the optimization of available resources in its
geographical area of authority in term
