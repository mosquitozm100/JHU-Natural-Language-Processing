BIOETHICS, THE ETHICS OF LIFE
     
     The technological revolution in the biological and medical sciences has produced
spectacular results while also sparking a revolution in thinking, conceptual traditions,
human values, and the notions of life, health, and death.  Organ transplants, genetic
engineering, artificial means of reproduction, euthanasia, ethics committees, and doctor-
patient relationships are current-day issues that have given rise to moral dilemmas which
are the object of academic and public concern and which are increasingly the focus of
articles in scientific publications, journals, and newspapers.

     The discussion surrounding this scientific-technological and cultural phenomenon
has shaped the field of bioethics (bios life + thik ethics) as a new professional and
multidisciplinary area of study and research.  Bioethics is not a new discipline, nor is it
a specialty within a particular discipline or profession.  No discipline or profession
appears to possess all the resources needed in order to address the political, economic,
social, biomedical, legal, ethical, and value-related dilemmas involved in bioethical
issues.  The development of bioethics is, without a doubt, a manifestation of a universal
cultural movement which in turn is an outgrowth of the concerns awakened by
progress in the area of biomedical technology and by the conflicts created by
progress and its application vis-Õ-vis basic human values, as well as its effect on the
health care of populations.

     Bioethics is being debated in every corner of the world.  In the developed countries
the debate began slightly more than two decades ago, and the proliferation of centers,
institutes, and national commissions on bioethics is clear evidence of the timeliness and
importance of this topic.  In Latin America, within universities, professional schools, and
other nongovernmental entities, there is a growing trend toward the organization of groups
concerned with bioethics.  In an isolated and fragmentary manner and with limited
resources, especially in terms of information, such groups are considering a number of
bioethical issues in response to growing public interest in this area.

     Medicine and health care have heretofore been and will always be social practices
with a profound humanistic and moral content.  As science and technology broaden the
capacity to intervene in the processes that determine or modify the life of individuals and
societies, there will be an increasing need to subject their use to ethical considerations. 
Bioethics is the challenge of the present that will reach into the future.
     
     BIOETHICS WITHIN PAHO

     Over the last several years the Organization has been exploring the subject of
bioethics. Its efforts thus far have been modest but have nevertheless had a significant
impact:

     (a) The publication of special issues of the Boletín de la Oficina Sanitaria
Panamericana and the Bulletin of PAHO devoted to bioethics (vol. 108, nos. 5 and 6, May
and June 1990, in Spanish and vol. 24, no. 4, 1990, in English) with a pressrun of some
11,000 copies, which was quickly exhausted, marked an important milestone in the
Region.  These issues of the Boletín are being utilized as study texts in numerous
universities and are being consulted as essential reference materials.  The content of the
Boletín was reprinted in Scientific Publication No. 527: Bioética - Temas y perspectivas
(1990) (also published in English:  Bioethics - Issues and Perspectives (1990)), which
have been as successful as the Boletín articles.

     (b) Scientific Publication No. 530, Aportes de la ética y el derecho al estudio del
SIDA (1991) (in English:  Ethics and Law in the Study of AIDS  (1992)), financed in part
by a generous contribution from the Federal Centre for AIDS in Canada, contains the
results of a successful Regional Consultation on the subject, held in Santiago, Chile, in
October 1990, with financing from the WHO Global Program on AIDS. 

     (c) Participation in specialized conferences and meetings on bioethics as a very
partial response to the numerous requests and invitations that are received.

     (d) Information and opinions about bioethical issues in response to requests from
government and university entities and individual investigators. 

     (e) Articles in specialized journals.

     (f) Organization of a data base with information on individuals and institutions
concerned with bioethics;

     (g) Institutional contacts with the principal centers and institutes of bioethics
throughout the Region and in the rest of the world.



ESTABLISHMENT OF A PAN AMERICAN INSTITUTE OF BIOETHICS
(BioEtica)

     A fundamental principle in the discussion of bioethics is that the criteria,
approaches, and solutions proposed must be consonant with the cultural context,
traditions, and institutions of each society.  In order to ensure that the conceptual and
applied development of bioethics in Latin America and the Caribbean takes place in an
informed, objective, and fruitful way, it would appear desirable and necessary to establish
an independent and pluralistic institution to carry out the functions of coordination,
cooperation, and support within a framework of international academic cooperation.

     A proposal has been advanced for the establishment of a Pan American Institute
of Bioethics (BioEtica), to be located at the University of Chile.  BioEtica would be a
program of study, research, training, cooperation, and international advisory services in
bioethics, as a Pan American institute under the administration and supervision of
PAHO/WHO, and at the same time it would be an academic, research, and extension
program in bioethics under the University of Chile.  BioEtica's dual role as a Pan
American Institute and a program of the University would be defined under an agreement.


     The Institute's mission would be the conceptual, normative, and applied
development of bioethics and the study of its relationship to health.  It would provide an
international, academic, pluralistic, independent, multidisciplinary, and professional
environment in which to carry out studies, technical discussions, research, education and
training, and dissemination of information on topics relating to bioethics, as well as to
develop and implement intercountry programs, projects, and activities and to provide
cooperation and advisory services in this area.
     
     BioEtica's functions would include the preparation of studies and reports, research,
education and training, dissemination of information, and advisory services and technical
cooperation in bioethics.  The foregoing would involve the analysis of bioethical issues
from a technical and ethical standpoint, taking into account the political, economic, social,
legal, cultural, and value-related dimensions in general and as they pertain specifically to
health care and medicine in the societies of Latin America and the Caribbean. 

     The Government of Chile would act as the host country, with the University of
Chile furnishing the academic and logistic facilities and the Organization providing the
international institutional framework in the form of a Pan American Institute.


     SYNOPSIS
     
     There is no doubt that bioethics is a signal concern of the present decade.  At the
academic and government level, and in the public mind in general, bioethical issues are
attracting more and more attention.  There is an increasingly urgent need for training,
research, dissemination of information, and technical cooperation. 

     The Director considers that this field of study, research, and reflection is
manifested in both the conceptual development and the application of bioethical
principles, orientations, and criteria.  The development of bioethics has a direct impact on
the social practice of medicine and health care, from multidisciplinary and
multiprofessional perspectives.  In this context, bioethics should have a place among the
activities of the Organization.

     The Director requests that the Executive Committee express its reaction to this
initiative for the establishment of a Pan American Institute of Bioethics (BioEtica), which
has the enthusiastic interest and support of Chile and which responds to a pressing need
that is of utmost importance for the health and well-being of the people of the Region.



DEMOCRACY, DEVELOPMENT, AND HEALTH



The relationship between Development and Health in Latin America is a complex one that
is dictated by interactions between the Development Model, the particular type of political
regime, and health.

In order for there to be Development there must be Democracy, since the former concept
is accepted to mean growth in the context of equity.  This in turn means that social
distribution must be a political function and that therefore certain mechanisms are needed
in order to guarantee both social and political participation.

Thus it will be necessary to institute processes to reinforce the social and political actors
who are in a position to generate, at the heart of the State, a negotiation space par
excellence--a balance of power between the interest groups affected in order to ensure that
they will encourage negotiation and the search for solutions based on consensus.

In this sense, liberal Democracy, as a political regime, emerges as a necessary and
sufficient condition for guaranteeing economic and social development in the medium and
long term.

It is desirable that there be a certain degree of development on the part of the various
social and political actors so that out of divergence the need for consensus will arise. 
Whenever the State (an Authoritarian State) imposes constraints that inhibit the
participation of some of its members, this promotes authoritarian-type solutions which in
the long run pervert the mechanisms of distribution and encourage, more than ever,
corporatist policies within the State.

The changes that have taken place in the Region in the last two decades have been the
result of failures in the implementation of developmentalist models which made it
necessary to suspend the development processes under way--processes based on local
industrialization (import substitution) and derived from the concept of a benevolent
redistributory State built on a foundation of liberal democracy.  The CEPALINO models
of the 1950s and 1960s contended that development in the Region necessarily called for
modernization and democratization of oligarchic societies that had found their expression
in populist States and corporatist and clientelist policies.

In order to achieve these objectives, it was proposed to broaden the urban and middle-
class base, and it was recognized that the extension of Social Policies was the means with
which to achieve this goal.

What in fact has happened, according to some authors, is a breakdown of the political-
economic structure that prevailed in many of the Latin American countries from the
beginning of the 1930s up until the 1970s (Cavarozzi, 1991)--the so-called state-
centered model.

From the political standpoint, this meant having to interrupt the political processes that
were keeping changes from being introduced (Argentina, Chile, Brazil and Uruguay), and
establishing what amounted to a new balance of power, which modified the nature of the
State.

At the end of the 1970s a number of factors (which will not be itemized here) came
together to force a reassessment of the democratic processes that would be needed in order
to ensure social peace, political stability, economic growth, investment, and the
development of social policy--concepts that set the tone for elections in Argentina, Brazil,
Chile, Ecuador, Paraguay, Guatemala, Honduras, and Uruguay during the 1980s.

But these Democracies emerged in the context of a series of new requirements:

·    To maintain the country's position in the international market

·    To guarantee social reproduction

·    To provide stability in order to give economic reforms a chance to be explored

·    To promote political reform within the State (reduction of the State apparatus)

·    To guarantee human, civil, and political rights


The responsibility vested in the regimes was great, and even in the partial list above we
can see that some of the objectives are inherently contradictory.

The crisis that arose in the Region during the 1980s was not limited to the economic
sphere; it was also seen in social and political symptoms of a structural nature. 
For example:

a)   The exclusion of certain key actors from the construction of Latin American
     societies;

b)   The inability of others to mount national-level initiatives that would rally the
     majority of the population;

c)   The resistance of traditional political parties to being restructured and democratized
     in order to adapt to the new political and social conditions in their societies, etc.

We should recognize two elements that were crucial to the changes taking place at the
level of the social actors.  The first is the significant contribution of the authoritarian
states--particularly the traditional ones and those associated with the protection of labor
interests such as unions and guilds--to the restructuring process.  The second is the failure
or lack of viability of the alternative social models that were being advanced by these
groups at the ideological level in a process that culminated in the crisis in the East in the
late 1980s and early 1990s.

But these constraints in themselves helped to set the stage for the appearance of other
actors, for a shift in their scene of struggle, and for the introduction of new issues on their
agendas.

Particularly in those countries that emerged from dictatorships during the 1980s, the
democratic struggle has engendered social movements aimed at the assertion of civil and
political rights, and specifically at the extension of individual rights in the areas of health,
education, housing, and the like, to broad sectors of the population--sectors that are highly
heterogeneous in terms of both class and political affiliation.

Thus a sort of interplay emerged involving, on the one hand, the actions of the Political
System, which usually reflect demands that are more structured and more tied to the
assertion of formal rights, and, on the other hand, those of the social movements, which
tend to relate to the substantive nature of the processes.  The outcome was to be a hybrid
that merged the characteristics of both political democracy and social democracy.

It must be acknowledged that this interaction has helped to advance the transition and
even to consolidate many of the claims that have been being asserted for as long as two
decades--e.g., the affirmation of human rights (in Argentina and Uruguay) and the
processes of constitutional reform which have served to broaden the concept of
citizenship, as the case of Brazil and Colombia.

It is often mistakenly assumed that economic decisions are entirely independent of
political decisions, since they are subject to natural laws that are beyond political
intervention.

In this view, the rising foreign debt service, the cutbacks in investments, and the
reductions in external savings are presented as phenomena that simply happen, whereas
in the political and social realms there are decisions that must be made.  These latter, in
turn, lead to increased unemployment, deterioration of public services, progressive loss
of State regulatory capacity, growth of the informal sector, increased violence, and
weakened social ties--all of which, along with other factors, have come together to
produce the serious social symptoms of the crisis.

If we approach this explanatory and analytical process from another angle, making an
effort not to lose sight of the process as a whole, we will see that these alterations have
taken place as a series of chain reactions, each constituting a milestone in the political
social and economic transition that is taking place in the societies of Latin America.  The
rise of authoritarianism, the constitutional-institutional shutdown, the prevalence of neo-
liberal views in the civilian and military leadership, the restriction of civil and political
rights, the trend toward democracy, the so-called "adjustment programs"--each of these
has been a phase in the construction of an alternative development model which is yet to
take final form.  Indeed, what we do see--namely the changes taking place within groups
and in the relationships between the dominant and subordinate sectors of society-
-are merely the tip of the iceberg.

The Latin American democracies, although they are opening up spaces for political
participation, are experiencing problems with regard to social participation, with the result
that in some cases the great majority of the population is excluded, and thus they are
revealing a certain incapacity to achieve not only political but also social stability.

In the words of former Argentine President Raúl Alfonsín, in his address at the opening
session of the Argentine Legislature in May 1988, the great challenge faced by the new
Latin American democracies is to meet the demands of society that have been pent up
over the last decade and at the same time to cope with the crisis and steer the restructuring
of the development models" (PAHO, 1990).

The political parties of today are not always able to serve as effective instruments for the
changes that are taking place in society, and hence it often happens that at the level of the
State the dominant groups govern without mediation.  There are innumerable cases of
cabinet members, advisers, and high-level public officials who have risen to their
positions not through any strong political mandate but rather through long association
with national and international economic groups.

There is yet another facet of the shifting dynamics in the strategies of the groups in power: 
attitudes are pervading the political system, sometimes even through parties of long
existence and tradition, that would tend to set aside populist practices and conceptions in
favor of an increasingly tecnocratic and pragmatic perspective.

The effects of this phenomenon are not measurable, but there appears to be a certain lack
of confidence in the ability of the parties to represent the entire population--as evidenced
by the frequent changes in government, the reduced political participation, and the
reappearance of charismatic leaders outside the party structure (Collor, Fujimori).

In 1991 and again in 1992 there have been a number of alarming signs such as the coups
that took place in Haiti, Peru, and the failed attempt last February in Venezuela.

We believe that the growing dissatisfaction of broad sectors of society and the frustration
of their aspirations in life and in the workplace can lead to the breakdown of institutions
and a loss of confidence in the democratic system.

The new democracies have emerged under the hegemony of neoliberal economic models,
but what is more important, they are also dawning in the context of new international
order.  This latter implies new economic, political, and military relationships between the
developed and the developing nations, and it calls for a world in which the alignments of
power are no longer bipolar but rather multicentric.

Some of the new factors that are conditining the democratic processes that we cited above
and serving as limitations to the consolidation of political and social democracy are:

1.   The budgets of the social sector.

2.   The rate of turnover at the cabinet level.

3.   A shift away from the 1970s concept of a single national health system.

4.   Deterioration of the social security systems.

5.   Emphasis on policies leading to privatization and on programs targeted toward
     groups at risk.

From among these factors,
