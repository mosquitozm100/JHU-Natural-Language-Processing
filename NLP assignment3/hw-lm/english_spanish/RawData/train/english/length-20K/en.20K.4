I.  INTRODUCTION

     In 1991 the guidelines in the plan of work, "Lines of Action
of the Campaign Against Malaria in 1991," which are analyzed
below, were adopted as the basic strategy for executing the
projects sponsored by the Nordic countries.  These guidelines
were presented to the participants in the Meeting on Sub-Regional
Technical Consultation on Malaria in Central America, held in
July 1991 at Managua.                                            
     It is important to note that in planning the activities of
the projects, the criteria adopted at the Ministry of Health\PAHO
meeting to evaluate international cooperation in Nicaragua, which
was held in June 1991, were used.  This meeting's principal
objective was to propose an execution of the projects more
logical and consonant with the priority policies of the Ministry
of Health, that is to say, based on the real needs of the Local
Systems of Comprehensive Care in Health (SILAIS) and their most
direct and effective participation.

     Also in 1991, Nicaragua succeeded in holding several
intercountry border-area meetings and another entitled "Sub-
Regional Technical Consultation on Malaria" with the
participation of all the Central American countries and Mexico,
whose immediate results were the preparation of a "Three-year
Project for 1992-94" and the Border-area Operational Plan for
1992.

     During the execution of the projects in 1991 two
occupational factors occurred which seriously affected the
execution of what had been programmed:  the general strike of
health workers (two months) and the Occupation Conversion Plan
(PCO), which affected a high percentage of personnel.

     In addition, the first financial allocation for 1991
transmitted by FINNIDA was received in March, which made
execution of the First Four-Month Plan difficult.

     It was in the above context that the execution of the
program was initiated almost in June, but planning was carried
out in order to promote development of Local Systems of
Comprehensive Care in Health (SILAIS) through the execution of
activities defined for that level.


II.  PROGRESS AND RESULTS

     Progress achieved
     
     The principal objectives of the project dealing with
strengthening decision-making capacity at the local level in
order to prevent and control vector-borne diseases in the
Honduras-Costa Rica-Nicaragua border regions (1991 Plan, drawn up
at San Pedro Sula in November 1990) were fulfilled:

     -    To promote increased closeness and strengthen the ties
of friendship among the people of Costa Rica, Nicaragua
and Honduras.

     -    To promote cooperation and mutual assistance among the
health sectors of the countries, as well as to be an
example and basis for cooperation among other sectors.

     -    To seek joint solutions to common health problems in
the border area through appropriate strategies.

     -    To maintain and improve health levels in border
communities.

     -    To strengthen the strategy of primary care, with Health
for All by the Year 2000 as the target.

     -    To promote the community's participation in the
identification and solution of its problems.

     -    To diminish the incidence and prevalence of vector-
borne diseases with emphasis on malaria, dengue, dengue
hemorrhagic fever/shock, leishmaniasis, and Chagas'
disease.

     The areas of cooperation among the border countries which
participate in the project were fulfilled by intensifying the
exchange of technical and operational information and mutual
support for works undertaken in the border areas.

     An increase in border-area epidemiological surveillance was
achieved through the signing of cooperation agreements at the
level of local systems (meetings at Estelí, Nicaragua; Liberia,
Costa Rica; Granada, Nicaragua, and local border-area operational
meetings).

     A joint review of the lines of action for controlling the
vector-borne diseases was carried out which emphasized patient
care, protection of the environment, and protection of workers'
health.  It was established in addition that hereafter the attack
on the vector will be based on analysis of risk factors to
diminish the indiscriminate use of insecticides.

     Joint plans for intercountry training were concluded,
especially in the SILAIS bordering on Costa Rica.

     The exchange of technical and epidemiological information
was carried out with both countries, particularly Honduras.

     All the activities were focused on development of the
SILAIS, a common strategy in the three countries.

     The operational decentralization of the projects toward the
SILAIS 
was initiated through direct relations with the regional health
directors, who assumed management of the activities planned in
the projects.

     Lines of propaganda and popular education in malaria were
defined as the acceptance by the population of medication and in
dengue as community participation in the destruction of breeding
sites.

     In Regions I and IV, meetings with voluntary collaborators
(345 participants) were carried out.

     Diminishing the incidence of malaria and dengue was achieved
in some border SILAIS, and epidemics of hemorrhagic dengue did
not occur.  Research on the incidence of Chagas' disease and
leishmaniasis continued to be carried out, and the structuring of
the national programs to control both diseases, which has the
technical and organizational support of Honduras, is under way.
     
In Summary:

     Concrete activities were defined in 1991 in accordance with
the National Plan for Controlling Vector-borne Diseases and the
projects were carried out according to lines of well-defined
action, in contrast to the execution in previous years when
technical material supply occupied a preponderant place and had
little relation to the targets to be fulfilled.  As a result, the
financial allocations were expanded to other areas of action
(1991 lines):

     1.   Training in measures against malaria and other vector-
borne diseases for SILAIS personnel.

     2.   Consolidation of social participation in the SILAIS.

     3.   Strengthening of regional entomology.

     4.   Development of operations research in the SILAIS.

     5.   Protection of the environment, utilizing insecticides
according to epidemiological criteria (risk factors).

     6.   Stimulus of intersectoral coordination.                

     7.   Increase in supervision and improvement of its quality.
     

     Activities and results obtained by project component

1.   Strengthening of the SILAIS.

     Activities aimed at strengthening the execution capacity of
the SILAIS were prioritized as the central strategy of the
Ministry of Health of Nicaragua.

     This is reflected in the direct award of funds to the
regional bureaus for expenditures on field operations (were
covered all the regions in this item) utilized in per diem,
repairs of vehicles, fuel, and purchase of technical equipment to
provide the SILAIS (20 microscopes, 600,0000 lancets, and 600,000
slides for taking blood samples).
     
     Automobile equipment (7 double-traction pick-up trucks),
water transport (5 pangas), 45 motorcycles, and 30 bicycles, all
obtained with funds allocated in the previous year, were
distributed.

     One hundred forty-seven Hudson sprinkler pumps, motorized
backpacks, and Swinfog devices which were purchased with 1990
funds were distributed.

     Funds were allocated to the border regions to control the
Aedes aegypti vector in vehicles which cross our borders.

     The Regional (100%) and Local (50%) Technical Councils were
carried out.  Activities to structure the Border-area Technical
Councils were initiated.

     Four local border-area meetings with Costa Rica by San
Carlos, Río San Juan, have been held.  The central subject was
epidemiological analysis and joint field measures between both
countries.

     A meeting was also held at Estelí in September by the health
personnel of Regions I and II and the personnel of the
neighboring SILAIS in Honduras, with 30 participants.

     A meeting to plan joint training activities for 1992 was
held at Granada (Region IV) with personnel from the border
regions of Costa Rica and participation by the central level of
Nicaragua.  A project to strengthen the educational processes in
the border-area SILAIS (38 participants) was prepared.  A joint
health diagnosis (Rivas SILAIS-Upala Canton-La Cruz Canton) was
also made and a system of epidemiological surveillance was
designed.

     In October there was participation in the subregional
meeting on dengue at San Pedro Sula (Honduras) and a three-year
operational plan for controlling dengue was prepared which is
pending approval by the Nordic countries.

     Other international events:

     -    A Technical Sub-Regional Consultation on Malaria in
Central America and Mexico, with the attendance of 40
participants, was held at Managua in July.

     -    Another meeting was held in August whose product was
the Three-year Plan for 1992-1994 for Controlling
Malaria and Other Vector-borne Diseases in Central
America and Mexico.  The first half of 1991 was
evaluated and the Operational Plan for 1992 was
structured with respect to the Honduras-Nicaragua-
Costa Rica border-area cooperation projects.

     Among the activities to develop the information and
surveillance system, six national meetings were held on
epidemiological evaluation of tropical diseases (50% of the
program), with the attendance of the regional management teams
(20 participants on the average).

     In addition, two courses were offered in the Central
Ministry of Health on "Basic Principles of Computation for
Personnel in the Regions" for a total of 80 persons from Regions
I, II, III, IV, and VI.

     The tropical disease personnel in the SILAIS were provided
personal protection equipment.

     With respect the active and passive search for cases of
malaria, the general health services contributed 40 percent of
the blood samples drawn and the voluntary collaborators
contributed 60 percent.

     Blood sampling was 64% accomplished, with 362,696 slides out
of a programmed total of 567,350 examined (Table 3).

     A total of 27,569 cases of malaria were detected (8,213
cases less that in 1990), and the Chinandega SILAIS, which
borders on Honduras, was found to be the most affected.  Even
though its Annual Parasite Incidence diminished with respect to
1990 from 44.8 to 33.8 cases per thousand population, it
contributed 43.3% of the country's malaria cases and 77.9% of the
cases in Region II in 1991 (Table 1).

     There was an increase with respect to 1990 in Plasmodium
falciparum cases of from 1,568 to 1,656 in 1991, and the most
affected SILAIS was Chontales (23.8% of the total) (Table 2).

     It is important to note that in the border-area SILAIS in
1991 there was a reduction in malaria cases, except for the Río
San Juan SILAIS bordering on Costa Rica, which because of
migration and new settlements resulting from the peace process in
the country experienced a marked deterioration in its
epidemiological situation (Table 2).

2.   Malaria and dengue situation by region

     REGION I (bordering on Honduras):

     Malaria increased by 106% over 1990.  Sampling increased
1.65 times.

     There were 964 detected positive cases, of which only three
were due to P. falciparum.   Cases increased in the three SILAIS,
although the most significant increase was in the Nueva Segovia
SILAIS, with an increase of 755.  The most problematic municipios
are Jalapa and Quilalí, which represent 70% of the cases in the
region and 92% in the Department of Nueva Segovia, located in the
zone bordering on the Republic of Honduras.  The parasitic index
increased from 1 to 2 per thousand population, and in Nueva
Segovia it rose from 2.11 to 4.37 per thousand.

     Control measures

     Household spraying was carried out in 5,029 dwellings (87%
of the total) in the municipios of Jalapa and Quilalí, but no
greater impact resulted because the situation worsened.

     Chemotherapy

     The principal measure was directed toward treatment of
positive cases, 92% by mouth, and there was also treatment of
cohabiters and control of foci in the localities of greatest
incidence.

     Training

     Training workshops were held for workers in the programs,
and five workshops were given for SILAIS workers and voluntary
collaborators in the municipios with the greatest malaria
problems, especially Jalapa and Quilalí.

     
     Dengue program

     Epidemiological situation:

     Only five presumptive cases of dengue were reported, three
in Estelí and two in the Madriz SILAIS.

     Entomological Situation:

     Control levels in infestation by the A. aegypti vector are
maintained in the region.  The SILAIS with greatest infestation
was Madriz, with 0.5% of the dwellings positive for the vector.

     Measures to control dengue were directed toward the vector:

     -    Inspection of dwellings.

     -    Treatment of foci, with abatization and peridomiciliary
and household spatial sprayings.

     Entomological surveillance measures using larval traps
located in places of highest risk gave us good results in
detecting foci, including the border posts of Las Manos and El
Espino.  As a surveillance measure, control was also maintained
by disinsecting vehicles in the border posts of Las Manos and El
Espino.

Principal problems

     -    The strike and the conversion plan, which reduced
personnel by 30%.

     -    Lack of supervision due to lack of transportation and
flexibility in per diems.

     -    Lack of inputs to fulfill the antilarval targets.

     -    Lack of materials for diagnosing malariaÐlancets, glass
slides.

     -    Lack of follow-up to vector reactions to the
insecticides used in the region for lack of a
biologist.

     REGION II (León, Chinandega, bordering on Honduras):

     Epidemiological situation of malaria

     Region II, located in the northwest part of the country
(Nicaragua), has an area of 9,896 km2 and a population of 688,868
inhabitants.

     It is an eminently agricultural region, with cotton,
sugarcane, and banana growing.

     Region II has the most serious malaria problem in the
country, having 52% of the cases nationally.  According to
statistical analysis and epidemiological studies, it has been
verified that of the 23 municipios that form region, only four
(El Viejo, Chichigalpa, Chinandega, and León) are responsible for
reporting up to 70% of the cases of malaria at the regional
level.

     Of these four municipios, El Viejo is that which has the
greatest malaria problem, while the municipio of León, which was
among those with the greatest incidence of malaria, has seen its
cases decrease by up to 50%.  It is important to note that this
municipio carries out its greatest effort in physical and
chemical control of anopheline breeding sites.  At the regional
level there was a reduction in the malaria cases of 5,913 in
1991.

     It is important to note that in blood sampling there was a
reduction of 37,981 samples compared to 1990.

     Conclusions:

     Despite the strike problem at beginning of the year, which
lasted up to two months, and the reduction in the field staff who
joined the Occupation Conversion Plan, the effort to carry out the
work of physical control of anopheline breeding sites, radical oral
treatment for most of the cases diagnosed, and the suspension of
household sprayings, after their application was evaluated,
continued, and we can conclude that the effort has been
advantageous.

     REGION IV (bordering on Costa Rica):

     In Region IV during 1990 and 1991, malaria cases were reduced
by 1,113, with five hundred cases in 1990.  Of a total of 51,616
samples examined, three of the cases which were classified as
imported from other regions of the country, were caused by P.
falciparum.  In 1991 there were 613 cases fewer than in 1990 in a
total of 48,668 samples examined, which means a reduction of 45.84%
in the number of cases and 5.71% fewer with regard to the samples
examined.  Of the cases that appeared in 1991, 11 were caused by P.
falciparum and classified as imported from other regions of the
country.

     1990 finished with a regional API of 2.08 and 1991 with 1.09
per thousand inhabitants.

     The Rivas SILAIS (bordering on Costa Rica) contributed 55.66%
of the malaria in the region, with an API of 2.90 in 1991 and an API
of 5.55 in 1990. 

     The region's problem municipio is Tola, which has 26.93% of the
regional cases and 48.38% of those in the SILAIS, with an API of
9.53.

     The municipios bordering on Costa Rica such as San Juan del Sur
and Cárdenas had a total of 23 and 37 cases of malaria in 1991,
respectively, with an API of 1.45 in San Juan del Sur and 11.21 in
Cárdenas.

     The reduction in malaria cases in the last two years has been
due mainly to the execution of epidemiological analyses in the
problem municipios and the selection, prioritization, and
application of different measures against the vector and the
parasite.  This has also been possible thanks to the fact that in
the same period we have had the effective support and execution of
the NIC-COR border-area agreement, sponsored by the Nordic
countries, which has translated into vehicles, motorcycles,
bicycles, equipment, materials, etc.  This has enabled us to
guarantee coverage to the municipios classified as at greatest risk
and to deal more rapidly with the situations which have arisen with
respect to the transmission of malaria.

     REGION VI (bordering on Honduras):

     From 1990 to 1991 cases were reduced by 3.75%, from 2,554 to
2,458, with an API in 1990 of 3.28 and in 1991 of 4.43.  From 1990
to 1991, sampling diminished by 11,276 (21.58%), with the variant
in population greater in 1990 of 776,297, and for operations in 1991
the population was 554,560.
