trary, it
characterizes a view of that kind as ethnocentric.  And it is
differentiated from the second by not giving priority to the
national-international relationship in its delimitation but
rather to the structure, processes, and relationships of world
power which in turn and to a different extent and in different
ways affect the configuration of the health-disease process and
the care systems within each national unit.

1.          The classical approach

The discussions during the meeting of concern to us revealed
the structural features of the model underlying the classical
approach to international health.  There was basic agreement as
to the characteristics of those features.

The features in question refer to both the definition of the
subject of study and the practices stemming from it.

In trying to present the characteristics of the classic
model schematically, as discussed during the meeting, the
ideological nature of the definition of the subject of study
which, based on an ethnocentric concept, defines the subject of
international health in relation to the "others" is seen.  This
definition of the "other" involves an attempt to understand what
is different by focusing on an implicit "we."  The "other" may be
peripheral countries or minorities in the central countries. 
Public health is limited to explaining and intervening in the
health question of the central countries, sometimes by excluding
minorities.  On the basis of this concept, the subject of public
health is thus defined on the basis of this implicit "we," while
that of international health is constructed in relation to the
cultural or economic "other."

This definition is not based on a relational analysis, i.e.,
on an approach that explains the emergence of a state of
development (for example, technologic underdevelopment) through
observation of those general processes which produce states of
technologic overdevelopment on the one hand, associated with
situations of technologic underdevelopment on the other.

Indeed, in this approach each category (underdeveloped
countries or minorities) appears as a total system, to explain
which it is only necessary to refer to the internal functions and
relationships of the system.

In this way, the asymmetry of power which occurs on a global
scale is hidden, and thus the fact that this may to a large
extent explain the conditions under which the countries on the
periphery are evolving.

In the same way, the fact that the asymmetrical
relationships of the different social groups within a national
unit is often omitted, which may explain the structures and
processes on which the subordinate social groups in the central
countries are articulated.

As discussed during the meeting, one of the consequences of
this definition is that the subject of study is made uniform. 
The peripheral countries appear to be subjects of uniform
actions.  The classic approach has in many cases operated on the
assumption that such countries are homogeneous among and within
themselves.

The foregoing has been expressed in the activities carried
out on the basis of this viewpoint in homogeneous and
decontextualized responses imposed on heterogeneous realities,
both from the cultural and economic viewpoints, of the peripheral
countries.

At the same time, the care concept was noted among others
which is implicit in the classic approach and which determines
the set of activities that are undertaken on the basis of this
viewpoint and that reduces a counterpart to an uncritical
internalizer of models and technologies whose priority and
pertinence was decided extranationally and from a unilateral
perspective.  Likewise, the importance of the prevalence of this
care concept in the treatment provided to social groups defined
as minorities became clear.

This care concept has impeded the execution of activities
aimed at strengthening the scientific and technologic capacity of
technologically underdeveloped countries.


2.          Some categories that could shape an alternative view of
international health

Points of agreement in relation to the critique of the
classic approach were not the only matters presented during the
meeting.  Certain categories could also be identified which were
pointed out by participants supporting different approaches which
could shape an alternative view in the subject of international
health.

In other words, there was a consensus on two points:  first,
on the recognition of the limitations of the so-called classic
approaches, and second, the need to construct new approaches in a
process already initiated by various groups in the Region.

The characteristics proposed for working out this new
approach include the aspects of delimiting the subject of study
from adequate theoretical and methodologic frameworks as well as
those aspects dealing with the mechanisms on the basis of which
the principles of international health can be implemented.

The need was pointed out for constructing independent
approaches which do not uncritically reproduce the dominant
concept of international health in the developed countries.  This
construction should include the contributions of investigators in
such countries who share the need to achieve a cooperative
approach.

The importance of not establishing a false dichotomy between
the northern and southern positions was stressed, but rather of
making an effort to develop, in view of the scant reflection in
this field in Latin America, an alternative of Latin American
thought as well as self-reflection for the set of actors involved
in matters of international health in the developed world.

With respect to delimiting the subject of study, it was
understood that international health should not be limited to the
field of the underdeveloped countries.  It was noted that there
are common themes in the regional health question which warrant
common reflection, basically at the level of the powerful spurs
which influence the health systems in most of the countries above
and beyond the north-south relationship and which are
crystallized in problems of financing the system; of asymmetry in
the relationships between the different professional categories
working in the sector; of the limitations of the proposals which
are predicated on volunteers, from whom it is expected that they
will make up for the inadequacies of the system; the introduction
of indiscriminate technologies; attempts to solve through
biomedical criteria the social problems arising from
socioeconomic determinants, environmental risks, and the
atomization of the health system.

As was emphasized in the meeting, the field of international
health requires an interdisciplinary approach.  This involves the
concurrence of both those disciplines which focus the analysis on
the international arena and the contribution of public health and
the social sciences.

At the same time, the intersectoral nature of the problems
of international health was noted for dealing with which both the
sectors directly linked to health care and those related to their
conditioners and determinants should take part.

Considered central in constructing an alternative approach
was the historical, national, and regional contextualization of
the activities established in order to preclude standardizing
normative actions by the countries, with a lack of information
about national processes.  Such contextualization would be based
on recognition of the cultural and economic heterogeneity among
and in each of the countries.

The essential objective of international cooperation in
health adjusted to this new approach would be to strengthen the
self-capacity of the countries intervening in the process of
cooperation in a conception according to which international
health activities would be used as an instrument of diplomacy and
solidarity and not as a mechanism of domination.

In turn, stress was put on the need to strengthen technical
cooperation among countries, which means a process of interaction
which is not unidirectional in nature and which is conducted not
only in the way in which it has been classically, i.e., from the
technologically developed countries toward the underdeveloped
ones.  In fact, the need was also considered of stimulating
cooperation between developing countries, between developed
countries, and from the former toward the latter, highlighting
the subjects of financing, organization, and development of
medical care services, human resources development, social
participation in health, and the environment.


3.          Two approaches to drawing up alternative models in
international health

Basically, two proposals were put forward during the meeting
to deal with the field of international health in order to
overcome the limitations of the classical approaches.  The first
is known as "new international health,"2 in contrast to that
called "traditional international health."  The second refers to
two dimensions of analysis:  on the one hand are the questions
which, from the international sphere, unduly influence the
health-disease process and the health care systems obtaining at
the national level (international dimensions of health); on the
other, there is the question of health as an international
matter.

These two proposals3,4 are developed by their authors in this
book and reflect the presentations made during the meeting.

The first approach starts from the idea that traditional
international health focuses on the health problems which affect
the developing countries, while the new international health
extends to health problems which affect all countries.

Traditional international health could be characterized by
an approach based on a view of developing countries which assumes
them to be homogeneous, while the new international health takes
into account the diversity between and within the developing
countries.  Traditional international health protect through
unilateral measures from the center to the periphery, while the
new international health would stimulate bilateral and
multilateral measures.  Traditional international health would be
based on the concept of aid in providing health services, while
the new international health would define the relationship
according to the concept and practice of cooperation in a gamut
which would include health teaching, research, and services.  The
approach of traditional international health would be based on
the concept of dependence, while that of new international health
would be carried out through the concept of interdependence.  In
turn, there is probably a difference of emphasis between
traditional and new international health:  while the former deals
with the communicable diseases, the latter would operate on the
basis of the epidemiologic transition.  Finally, while
traditional international health be based on primitive health
services, new international health would operate on and for the
transition of the health services.2

In the latter approach, international health is defined as a
field of public health and its interdisciplinary nature is
stressed.  Between the one and the other the difference would be
in the spheres of action:  while public health would constitute a
field of research and of action in health activities defined by
its population level and framed within the political and
administrative boundaries of the countries, international health
would take into account questions that transcend a country's
borders by using the tools of public health and information
contributed by other disciplines.

The second approach rests on two substantive factors: 
consideration of international health as a division of the vast
field of international relations which are thought of as a system
of power relationships and, in the second place, international
health as a field of health, thought of on the basis of its
internationalization as part of the transnationalization of
economics.5

These two elements are articulated to delimit a field
expressed as follows:  " ... one which corresponds to a
definition in the broad field of international relationships
considered as a political, economic, and military superstructure
which regulates relationships among nations and which we call
health as an international matter.  Health as an international
matter enables us to analyze ... the regulations, uses, and
customs of a health nature in the international framework,
financial resources, goods and services which flow from one place
to another on the planet, its participation in global flows, and
certain health events which are transformed into political
(border closings), economic (quarantines), or military events
(blockades of drugs and medical inputs, etc.)" ...  "Another line
of reflection arises from the national arenas of the Latin
American countries, i.e., from national health systems, by trying
to keep alive those phenomena or processes which are
international in nature.  We have called this second line of work
the international dimensions of health."3

From this approach an attempt would be made to reveal
dimensions which are systematically concealed in most
investigations of the health sector and which are, for example,
related to the marked and growing dependence which national
health systems have toward the transnationalized medico-
industrial complex.

From this perspective it is emphasized that the concept of
interdependence, used to take into account relationships between
countries of different technologic, economic, and military
development hides the asymmetry of such relationships.  "It is
obvious that a technologically advanced nation state needs the
markets and human and material resources of other nations in
order to guarantee its development, and in this sense there is a
certain amount of interdependence, but the quality of the two
`dependencies' is different."4


II.         Elements for defining a field

One of the advances at the meeting was the articulated
formulation of a set of questions about international health. 
Some of these questions are strategic in nature, while others are
theoretical and methodologic, and still others deal with
practices.  All of them refer to points which appeared to be
central in the discussions and implicitly or explicitly express
that need several times to construct explanatory models which
from international health lead to the search in which various
groups in the Region are engaged which, from different
disciplines, deal with the health-disease process and care
systems.

From this set of questions arise those which deal
specifically with international health as a subject of
consideration and whose point of departure is, What is meant by
the concept of international health? and continues with the
following:  When international health is spoken of, is one
referring to an explanatory model, a discipline, an intellectual
field, a problem area within public health, or a subject for
consideration?

And, in any case, What is the strategic usefulness of
arguing about legitimacy in a field appropriated by a concept
termed ethnocentric by most of the meeting's participants?

And then:  if up to now international health has had to do
with health in the developing countries defined according to the
views of certain interests in the central countries, what meaning
does the subject of international health have when seen from the
perspective of the peripheral countries?  And in such a case, Is
it pertinent to work out a view of international health which has
an explanatory capacity about the problems we have to confront in
the Region and therefore important in the North and South?

What are the body of knowledge, specific skills, and the
field of application of international health?

These and other questions should be dealt with in order to
define the nature of the question.  Some of them are also found
in the studies presented here.


1.          Why international health?

Without other intent than to initiate a problematization
and, in any case, a contextualization of the foregoing questions,
it is understood that it is important to observe that, in the
concern of the teams which are trying to develop international
health as a subject of reflection two observations converge, the
first sociohistorical in nature and the second of a theoretical
character.

In the first, reference is made to the intensification of
economic and political processes at the global level during the
past decade, with repercussions in the health field, which have
resulted in the adoption in the Region of economic adjustment
measures which lessen the ability of health systems to care for
the health of the population at the same time that poverty
increases and health conditions worsen.

As noted in one of the studies presented in this
publication, at the beginning of the 1990s the Latin American
economies had experienced a serious economic regression which
accentuated their basic characteristics of rates of inflation,
external indebtedness, and inequalities in distribution of income
which are among the highest in the world.6

Latin America's economic regression, as another of the
studies published notes, imposed to a large extent by concealment
of the geopolitical nature of external debt, occur in a world
which has undergone changes during the past decade characterized
by the development of the multipolarity of the centers of world
power, a period of instability in the industrialized countries
characterized by chronic inflationary processes, reduction in
their rates of growth and disequilibriums in the balance of
payments, inclusion of the peripheral countries in the new world
order under conditions of asymmetry characterized in the economic
sphere by the internationalization of their national markets and
by the external indebtedness and a strengthening of the
relationships of economic and political interdependence
stimulated by the expansion of financial markets, the interests
of transnational companies, and the opening of economic borders
caused by decontrol of exchange rates.5

The industrialized countries take part in this process of
economic internationalization by forming internal alliances among
economic interests, cooperation agencies, and the state.  For
that purpose, they also redefine the role of the state and adapt
their national policies on the basis of the new stage and, in
turn, formulate through it the rules which stimulate trade
exchanges and different bilateral and multilateral forms of
cooperation.

Meanwhile, the periphery attends this process with national
states weakened by those who impose integration rules on them
which are often contrary to national interests because of the
external indebtedness and relationships of subordination with the
centers of power.

In Latin America there is discussion about the need for
regional integration as a way to deal with such a situation of
subordination. It is recognized that the health sector can
contribute thereto by drawing up joint policies designed and
implemented through different mechanisms of technical and
financial cooperation among countries.

To support the processes of drawing up such joint policies,
whether they are governmental in nature or not, as well as to
take account of the socioeconomic and health conditions in which
they will be formulated, a level of explanation is required which
can be seated in the field of international health, as will be
defined below.

The foregoing does not mean that that level of explanation
required cannot be found through another kind of approach, but
that the concept of international health necessarily refers to
the consideration that the sociohistorical and health conditions
mentioned above with an implicit unity of analysis which is the
global social system.

Up to this point the sociohistorical reasons which draw us
to international health, a characterization of which are set out
in the first part of this book.

The second observation to which we refer is theoret
