aluation of Efficiency in Maternal and Child Health
Services."  This instrument makes it possible to examine
the structure of health care resources and assess their
capacity to ensure that the services operate effectively. 
The methodology has some limitations, but it is
nevertheless quite useful in identifying the structural and
procedural elements that either favor or hinder service
development.  Systematic application of the instrument can
contribute to the process of reorganization and
strengthening of maternal and child health services.

     This methodology for evaluating efficiency, which
originated during the 1960s, has been utilized in a number
of countries throughout the Region, with modifications to
tailor it to the epidemiology and operational modalities of
their services.

     In early 1985, the PAHO Programs on Maternal and Child
Health and Health Services Development brought together
several groups of experts to revise the guidelines for
evaluation, standardize the elements observed, and
introduce updated criteria and approaches in maternal and
child health care.

     A consensus model was thus developed, and application
thereof was promoted in all the countries of the Region. 
An attempt was made to keep the questions and scoring
uniform with a view to collecting data that would permit
some type of Regional analysis, although it was recognized
that the greatest value of this instrument lies in its
capacity to promote changes at the local health system
level.

     The model developed was disseminated in several
publications that were prepared for this purpose.  It was
soon accepted by the countries of the Region, which
undertook to apply it.  To date, 18 countries have utilized
this methodology based on the PAHO model to evaluate a
sampling of their services.  In one case (Córdoba,
Argentina), a study was conducted of all the services in
the public sector and the data have been cross referenced
with indicators of hospital productivity and performance.

     In several countries successive evaluations have been
carried out at one- or two-year intervals, which has made
it possible to follow the evolution of care conditions and
also to note whether or not the evaluations have had any
effect on the services.

III. SUMMARY OF RESULTS

     The instrument utilized makes it possible to express
numerically the degree of efficiency in every service.  An
optimum score would be 100% of the assignable points.  The
lists of questions are grouped into the following subject
areas:  physical plant, human resources, standards and
procedures,  programming and administration, supplies,
health education, and community participation.

     The different types of service that provide care for
the maternal and child population are grouped as follows: 
health posts, health centers or outlying physician's
offices, outpatient obstetrics and gynecology, outpatient
pediatrics, inpatient neonatology, inpatient pediatrics,
and inpatient obstetrics and gynecology.

    
     Thus, when the resulting figures are tabulated it is
possible to analyze the data by type of service (health
post, health center, etc.) or by area in general or within
each type of service (physical plant, programming and
administration, etc.).
     
     This summary presents only the results by type of
service (Table 1) and overall results by area in all the
services evaluated (Table 2).  Since there is a wide range
of scores, the following frequency distribution criteria
were adopted based on the scores obtained: 

     Scores under 40% - Critical situation
     Scores between 40% and 79%  - Unsatisfactory
     Scores of 80% or over - Satisfactory

     Table 1 shows the results of frequency distribution by
type of service and overall scores obtained for the 1,611
services that were included in this study.

     An initial observation is that 80% of all types of
service fall under the heading of unsatisfactory (i.e.,
scores between 40% and 79%) and 14% are in critical
condition, whereas only 6% achieve a rating of
satisfactory.

     An examination of the "critical situation" column in
Table 1 reveals that a low percentage of health posts,
health centers, and outpatient centers are in such poor
condition.  However, the figures for inpatient services in
the areas of neonatology, obstetrics, and pediatrics are
close to and sometimes above 20%.  This shows the weakness
of hospital referral levels and points up the need to
strengthen this area.

     Table 2 presents a similar classification of the
scores obtained in different areas within the various types
of services.

     It is clear that the area of "community participation"
is the weakest component, given that the situation is
critical in 61% of the services that should include such
participation, while it is satisfactory in only 2%.  The
Region has only recently begun the process of democratizing
health care, and even in services at the primary care level
authoritarianism and exclusion of the community from
decision-making processes are common.

     Next in terms of seriousness are programming and
administration, with 47% in the "critical situation"
category and just 7% at satisfactory levels.  These figures
reflect the frequently noted fact that the health care
services, especially hospitals, do not program their
activities or have data on the population that they are
responsible for serving.

     At the other extreme is the area of "supplies," with
just 9% in the "critical situation" column and 39% under
"satisfactory."  This is probably due to the tremendous
effort that has been put forth by different components of
the Program to ensure that essential supplies for maternal
and child health care are provided on a timely basis. 

     These are only a few examples extracted from the
totality of the data available.  Specific studies with
cross-referencing are being carried out with statistical
data on hospitals, which will yield information that will
be particularly useful for the improvement of health
programs and services and for the rechanneling of technical
cooperation.


IV.  OUTLOOK AND RECOMMENDATIONS

     Analysis of the information available shows the
tremendous weaknesses in the services that provide maternal
and child health care.  Nevertheless, it is encouraging to
note that less than 15% of all the services are in critical
condition.  In other words, 85% are in unsatisfactory or
satisfactory condition, and it should be possible to
improve this situation in the medium term without huge
outlays through efforts aimed at enhancing programming and
management in the services.

     This methodology should therefore continue to be used. 
It should be adopted by new countries and carried on by
those that have already applied it as a means of monitoring
the advances made in the implementation of local health
systems.  In fact, four countries have already undertaken
successive evaluations and as a result have been able to
identify changes in the condition of their services.

     The relationship between the process of
decentralization and the development of local health
systems led PAHO to establish an Interprogram Group, which
is formulating more comprehensive methodologies on the
basis of this experience with a view to developing
mechanisms for evaluating the general operating capacity of
the services and measuring their impact on community
health.   At the same time, the Program on Maternal and
Child Health is working to develop a methodology for the
evaluation of community participation.

     It is evident that the evaluation of efficiency and
progressive application of the methodology in the countries
is a positive contribution toward the development of local
health systems, the strengthening of coordination between
programs and services, and more rational utilization of the
sector's resources. 

SPECIAL REPORT

AIDS AMONG WOMEN
IN LATIN AMERICA AND THE CARIBBEAN

   In Latin America and the Caribbean the AIDS epidemic is increasingly affecting women and children. 
The proportion of accumulated cases reported among women in the Caribbean as of 1989 (49.7 per million)
was higher than the proportion in North America (28.6 per million).  Serological data confirm that the
prevalence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in prostitutes and women with infected male
partners is particularly high in the Caribbean, sometimes as high as 70% according to several studies. 
Morbidity reports received by the Pan American Health Organization show that the incidence of AIDS cases
in women increased by 185% in the Caribbean and 4548% in Central America between 1986 and 1989. 
Other areas of the Region, although they have not been as heavily affected, have also shown an increase in
the number of AIDS cases in women.  There is an urgent need to step up and coordinate serological
surveillance in order to enable better quantification of HIV infection among women in Latin America and the
Caribbean.  National AIDS programs should promote intensive education campaigns to protect women from
HIV.  In order to prevent infection, it is essential to ensure that no HIV-contaminated blood is used in
transfusions required for emergency treatment in connection with abortions or other obstetrical
complications.
INTERNATIONAL MEETING FOR THE ERADICATION OF
BOVINE TUBERCULOSIS IN THE AMERICAS

Saltillo, Coahuila, Mexico, 18-20 November 1991

FINAL REPORT

     Dr. Carlyle Guerra de Macedo, Director of the Pan American
Health Organization, in response to a request made by the
Ministers of Health during the VII Inter-American Meeting, at the
Ministerial Level, on Animal Health (RIMSA VII), held in
Washington, D.C., from 30 April to 2 May 1991, to prepare a
proposal for a plan of action for the eradication of bovine
tuberculosis in the Americas, convened the present meeting to
prepare and discuss the plan jointly with the national
authorities. 

     Thanks to the collaboration of the Office of the
Undersecretary of Agriculture and Water Resources (SARH) and the
hospitality of the State Government of Coahuila, the city of
Saltillo was offered as the venue for the meeting.

     The meeting, which was convened from 18 to 20 November 1991,
brought together 46 professionals from 20 countries in the
Americas:  Argentina, Belize, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Costa
Rica, Cuba, Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Ecuador, Guyana,
Honduras, Jamaica, Mexico, Nicaragua, Paraguay, Panama, United
States of America, Uruguay, and Venezuela.  The meeting was also
intended by four international organizations, IDB, IICA, OAD, and
IOE, and Mexican livestock associations. 

     The meeting was inaugurated on 18 November by the Governor
of the State of Coahuila, Eliseo Mendoza Berrueto.  Also on the
presidium were Dr. Gustavo Reta Petterson, Undersecretary for
Livestock in the Secretariat of Agriculture and Water Resources
of Mexico (SARH), Dr. Héctor Campos López, Director General of
Animal Health of SARH, Dr. Jorge Galo Medina Torres, Secretary of
Rural Development of the State of Coahuila, Dr. Raymundo Verduzco
Rossan, Secretary of Health of the State of Coahuila, Reginaldo
de Luna Villarreal, Delegate of SARH to the State of Coahuila,
and Francisco García Castell, representing the National
Livestock Federation.  During the ceremony, Dr. Juan Manual
Sotelo, PAHO/WHO Country Representative in Mexico, spoke on
behalf of Dr. Carlyle Guerra de Macedo, recalling the request of
the Member Governments to prepare a plan of action for the
eradication of bovine tuberculosis and the urgent need to
undertake actions in all the countries for this purpose in order
to reduce the financial and business losses brought on by this
disease.  He also referred to the importance of bovine
tuberculosis to public health at a time when almost 8,000 human
cases were reported in the Americas from this infection.

     Dr. Sotelo also mentioned the importance of ensuring that
the countries and areas, which had a total bovine population of
approximately 215 million head, were kept free from this disease. 
Finally, he urged the countries to pool their efforts in
formulating strategies to combat the disease jointly and offered
the support of the technical cooperation of the Pan American
Health Organization in reaching the targets set by the countries.

     Dr. Gustavo Reta Petterson, Undersecretary for Livestock of
SARH, after thanking PAHO/WHO for the honor of choosing Mexico as
the venue for such an important event, recalled that during the
1970s several countries took actions to combat bovine
tuberculosis with the result that at the present time there were
three categories of country situations:  1) Countries that have
achieved eradication or are very close to doing so; 2) Countries
that have succeeded in reducing prevalence to levels that will
make it possible to achieve eradication within a reasonable
amount of time; and 3) Countries that still have high prevalence
of the disease or do not have complete information available on
their situation.  Under present-day political, economic, and
social circumstances the plan of action represented a step
forward for the Latin American and Caribbean countries in the
elimination of bovine tuberculosis.  Dr. Reta noted that
diagnostic methods and epidemiological surveillance systems still
had to be improved; however, it was necessary to begin on a sound
basis by focusing on mass communication as a means of achieving
participation of the producers, even in the costs of the program. 
Lastly, Dr. Reta noted that the present time was a historic one
and therefore appealed to the participants to work hard and to
make appropriate recommendations for their countries. 

     Eliseo Mendoza Berrueto, Governor of the State of Coahuila,
viewed the meeting as a privileged opportunity to recognize the
ongoing work of the livestock producers of Coahuila in behalf of
public health in preserving the health of dairy cattle in the
region.  He also expressed concern for the bovine tuberculosis
situation in some countries, and in particular in Mexico as an
exporter of cattle on the hoof, noting that if the problem was
not dealt with properly it could bring about very serious
consequences.  The Governor then offered his decided support to
SARH and to all the organizations involved in undertaking the
venture and requested that all international organizations
provide collaboration in all stages of the programs.  He then
invited the cattlemen, as the principal actors involved, to
participate actively in carrying out the campaign.  Governor
Eliseo Mendoza Berrueto then concluded his remarks by welcoming
the participants and extending a warm greeting on behalf of the
people of Coahuila.

     The officers of the meeting were then elected, as follows: 
as Chairman, Dr. Douglas Hernández, Delegate of Venezuela; as
Vice Chairman, Dr. Silverio Tamayo, Delegate of Cuba; and as
Rapporteur, Dr. José Naranjo, Delegate of Chile.  PAHO/WHO acted
as General Secretariat for the meeting.


     The Program of Work (Annex 2) was developed in three plenary
sessions and in working groups in which the bases for structuring
the plan of action were discussed.

     The working group meetings were preceded by introductory
remarks by PAHO/WHO and SARH officials.

     During the plenary sessions the participants heard
presentations on:  "The Current Situation of Bovine Tuberculosis
in the Americas," by Dr. Elmer Escobar, Director of the Pan
American Zoonoses Center; "Bases for a Plan of Action for the
Eradication of Bovine Tuberculosis in the Americas," by Dr.
Eduardo Alvarez, Chief of Field Work of the Pan American Zoonoses
Center; and "Diagnostic Methods for Bovine Tuberculosis," by Dr.
Isabel Kantor, also of the Pan American Zoonoses Center.

     The participants were divided into four working groups on
the basis of the similarity of the epidemiological situation of
bovine tuberculosis and the geographical situation in their
countries of origin.  Officials from PAHO/WHO and other
international organizations, together with observers, were
distributed among the groups to provide support for and to act as
facilitators for the discussions (Annex 3).

     Dr. Albino Belotto of PAHO presented the methodology for the
working groups and explained how they were to be distributed,
noting further that all discussions would be accompanied by
guides prepared for this purpose (Annex 4).

     Four working sessions were held in which a topic was
discussed selected from the meeting's Program of Work.  At the
beginning of each working group session the topic was introduced,
as follows:

     -    "Definition of Areas on the Basis of their
Epidemiological Situation."
Dr. José Germán Rodríguez Torres - PAHO/WHO 

     -    "Bases for Epidemiological Surveillance of Bovine
Tuberculosis."
Dr. Salvador Solís - DGSA, SARH, Mexico

     -    "Strategies for the Control and Eradication of Bovine
Tub
