amming guide for each local health system
should come about through a flexible process of participation
that allows for the incorporation of each and every
experience that occurs in light of different types of
knowledge within a common framework that lends the
consistency and coherence necessary for their generalization.

      Because this is a process that develops and advances
over time, it should never be considered that what has been
achieved constitutes a new model of programming.  The guide,
or guides, should always be viewed as a consolidation of the
state of the art, subject to changes and alterations in form
or substance, based on the new knowledge and options that
will inevitably be generated throughout the process. 
Presented below is a possible sequence of some--though by no
means all--of the activities that may be carried out during
the process of programming.  It must be emphasized that these
activities can also be carried out simultaneously.


    3.1.-  Identification of Health Problems:  Application of
the Epidemiological Approach

      The identification of health problems is based on a
description and assessment of the health situation in
relation to the theoretical and methodological approach
adopted by whoever provides the assessment.

      However, the identification of problems depends not only
on who does the assessing, but also on the purpose of the
identification (why are they being identified?), the level or
position from which the problems are being identified (where
are they being identified?), and the group that is chiefly
affected by the problems identified.

      Within the approach that has been adopted, it is assumed
that the identification of problems, and the consequent need
for promotion, prevention, recovery, and rehabilitation of
the health of individuals and families, social groups and the
environment, occurs during the process of leadership in the
local health system (including the participation of all
involved social actors), the objectives being transformation
of the health system and health conditions and the
achievement of equity and greater effectiveness and
efficiency.  The final beneficiaries of this whole process
are the social groups, and therefore all the individuals, who
live within the sphere of action of the local health system.


      The process involves the participation of health service
technicians (from the public and private subsectors and from
social security institutions), political authorities,
professional associations, and representatives of population
groups, all of whom identify, discuss, and analyze health
problems.  In order for this to be possible, steps must be
taken to facilitate and promote social participation at all
levels so that the analysis, discussion, and determination of
the existing health situation is carried out by the
appropriate social actors.

      The initial assessment attempts to identify health
problems and their causes, with a view to providing the
elements necessary for programming the intervention of the
local health system, determining the actions that will be
required at other levels of the national health system, and
coordinating with other sectors the activities that, although
they affect health, require interventions that fall outside
the scope of the sector.

      The preliminary list of problems and needs should be
subject to a review in which specialists, applying the
appropriate specific knowledge, act as advisers in the
overall process of programming in the local health system. 
This review and adjustment may, and usually does, give rise
to new rounds of discussion involving social actors.  The
discussions should continue until there is fairly general
agreement as to the assessment of the health situation, as
well as its determining causes, within the area of the local
health system.

      To facilitate discussion, the following characteristics
of the population, resources, health status, and context
might be taken into consideration: 


    a)     Population.  The characteristics of the individuals
in certain social groups by sex, age group, socioeconomic
status, geographical area, and other variables that influence
or determine the epidemiological situation.  Families should
also be typed on the basis of several of the preceding
variables, as well as variables related to habits that can
affect health.   There should also be consideration of the
characteristics of family members, such as pathologies or
differentiated behavior, that can affect the family group.

      Information on persons who work in productive processes
and who are therefore subject to the influence of a work
environment that affects health, both individual and
collective, in terms of the type of process and the
integration and position of these individuals in the
productive system.

      It is also important to take into consideration
information on population groups in terms of the communities
they live in and the character
