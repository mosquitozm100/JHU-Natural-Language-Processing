ms for
comprehensive care of the elderly.

The primary emphasis of national
programs should be the maintenance
of elderly persons within their
family environment, enabling them to
preserve the utmost physical,
mental, and social independence.
STRATEGIES AND PRIORITIES

1.   To heighten awareness in the
     general public and in decision-
     making circles of the needs of
     the elderly and their right to
     non-discriminatory treatment
     and comprehensive care.

2.   To obtain and disseminate
     relevant information on the
     situation of the elderly in the
     Member Countries.

3.   To promote an examination of
     the medical and social programs
     and services for the elderly
     with a view to rationalizing
     their use within a framework of
     comprehensive coverage,
     efficiency, and effectiveness.

4.   To promote active involvement
     of the elderly in diverse
     pursuits that will enhance
     their bio-psycho-social
     capacities.









LINES OF ACTION


1.  Mobilization of resources

One of the Program's foremost lines
of action is to enlist the
participation of the various sectors
and agencies, both governmental and
private, in order to obtain greater
technical and financial support for
national activities.


2.  Dissemination of information

The dissemination of knowledge and
experiences in regard to programs
and services to help the elderly, as
well as support for the publication
of related information in the
countries, is an extremely important
facet of the Regional Program which
is backed by a technical information
service based at PAHO headquarters.


3.  Use of the mass media

The Program also promotes use of the
mass media as an instrument for
educating the public.  In this way
it attempts to combat the negative
myths that surround old age and
replace them with a positive
attitude toward the elderly and
their problems, while promoting the
adoption of appropriate policies. 


4.  Training 

Since 1986 the Program has sponsored
an Annual Regional Course on
Gerontology for health science
professionals involved in national,
provincial, or local care programs
for the elderly.  It also arranges
international workshops for the
exchange of experiences in the
provision of services for this age
group.

5.  Direct technical cooperation

Technical cooperation is provided to
the countries for the design,
execution and evaluation of
programs, the transformation of
services, and the adoption of
strategies for research and manpower
development.  The Regional Adviser,
supported by a panel of experts from
the Region, provides the services
required by the countries.


6.  Promotion of research

Within this priority area of the
Program, particular importance is
attached to epidemiological and
operations research.  Noteworthy
endeavors in this connection include
the Survey of the Needs of the
Elderly, carried out in 15
countries, and the studies of
morbidity, prevalence of dementia,
and patterns of drug use among the
elderly.
