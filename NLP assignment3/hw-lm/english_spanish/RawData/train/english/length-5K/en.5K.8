ll, perhaps, than the threat of
nuclear war.  I would like to mention four of them, since I consider these to be particularly important for
determining what kind of development we need.

First, while ideological differences and the East-West conflict may have been resolved, regionalist,
nationalist, and especially religious and ethnic fervor is on the rise.  The presence of this regionalism,
nationalism, and ethnocentrism has already been confirmed in the post-Cold War period, for example by the
Persian Gulf war, the regional conflicts in the Balkans, and the threat of many other conflicts in Eastern Europe. 
And there are other conflicts elsewhere that also pose a threat to peace and solidarity, which are essential and
universal conditions for progress. 

Second is the gap between rich and poor, another enormous conflict that the world has been unable to
overcome.  It is unbelievable, and it is absolutely unacceptable, at the end of this century, during which we
humans have learned to utilize science and technology to harness nature and put it to our service, that we
continue to increase our capacity for destruction and limit our capacity for creation.  And it is equally
unacceptable that three-fourths of humankind continue to live in poverty, and almost half of these people in
abject poverty.  The gap between rich and poor, between powerful and weak, may ultimately prove to be the
greatest threat to the stability and progress of nations.  The new international order that is being fashioned on
the basis of large blocs of power has yet to enlist the forces liberated from the East-West conflict and the arms
race to establish a new type of dialogue and cooperation between North and South, between developed and
underdeveloped countries (because we cannot use, even euphemistically, the expression "developing"
countries) so as to build the solid bases of support needed in order to preserve the stability of the universe.

Third, humankind's capacity to dominate nature has been wielded without respect for the finite
resources that have taken millennia to form.  Immoderate consumerism, unbridled materialism, and the license
to destroy, even in the process of producing, have become enormous risk factors that threaten to overwhelm
our planet and bring an end to life itself.  Pollution, the depletion of nonrenewable resources, and many other
expressions of environmental deterioration are manifestations of this enormous conflict that we have yet to
resolve.

We in this poorer part of the world are sometimes accused of arriving late at the banquet of modern
production and industrialization, and it is said that through our poverty we are destroying and contaminating the
earth's remaining natural reserves--and this is true.  But the powerful nations forget who it was that first
destroyed our natural heritage and overlook the fact that any damage we are now doing represents only a
fraction of the devastation that is being wrought on the environment, the common heritage of humankind.  The
environment is a resource that should be utilized for development intended to benefit human beings, but we
cannot forget that it is also the insurance policy that must secure the future of generations to come.

The fourth conflict, the development and consequences of which offer both extraordinary possibilities
and extraordinary risks for our countries, is the new economic order that is being forged at the global level.  The
major economic powers have joined forces, recognizing that, despite their size, their domestic markets are not
sufficient to sustain the new forms of production and the efficient use of science and technology that
development requires.  The "Europe of the Twelve," which will probably soon become the "Europe of the
Thirty," North America, and the Pacific Rim, constitute large economic blocs whose power and influence will
shape the immediate future of the universe.  The competition between them, coupled with the increasingly
rapid evolution of science, offer opportunities for the poor, but they also present a tremendous challenge for
which we are not prepared.  How can we confront the competition of such powers as Europe, the United States
of America, and Japan?  Can we, the underdeveloped nations of the world, and Latin America in particular, with
the divisive forces that undermine our unity, establish the conditions needed for a regional movement that will
lay the groundwork for a sustained process of negotiation and for real and effective integration of our countries
into the new world order?

It is in this context that we must face the great challenge to Latin America and to Peru--the challenge
of development.  But we must not repeat the mistakes of the past.  Minister Yamamoto has already alluded to
the failures that the Governments have experienced up to now in the promotion of development, and with good
reason.  Even during periods of accelerated growth, which in many cases were considered true economic
miracles (
