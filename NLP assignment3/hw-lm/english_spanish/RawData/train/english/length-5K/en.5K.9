on-evaluation may reveal. 

     -    Maintain appropriate coordination at all times with the
regulatory units at the central levels of the
participating organizations in order to ensure
consistency in direction and continuity, in addition to
support of technical assistance in any programs that
are put into operation.  

     It is important to implement and support large-scale
     national efforts aimed at redesigning national models for
     the development of health in the form of sets of regulatory
     criteria that can progressively serve as very effective
     guides and promoters of change in the management,
     configuration, and operation of health programs and actions
     in an intense and ongoing process of analysis and
     application that systemically synergize and integrate the
     principal components outlined below.


III  COMPONENTS OF THE PROJECT

     COMPONENT 1:   Redefinition of the Strategies for Attacking
Health Problems

     From a new concept of health in development, the business of
     the health sector extends beyond the limited framework of
     traditional concepts of health to consider the factors of
     living conditions and social welfare.  This imposes the need
     for the forms of sectoral action to review and reconsider a
     field of intersectoral intervention by multiple social
     actors in the biological, ecological, cultural, and
     socioeconomic processes that are predominant in a given
     society at a given time and that constitute a different
     approach and a different procedure in rethinking health
     problems and redefining the attack strategies by emphasizing
     consideration of the risk factors and the groups at risk in
     light of the sociopolitical, economic, and environmental
     trends characteristic of the present decade.

     COMPONENT 2:   Review of the Organization and Operation of
Health Care Systems 

     The fact that large sectors of the population still do not
     have access to the health services at a time when the living
     conditions of large social groups are deteriorating
     constitutes a great challenge to the ability of the health
     sector to organize and interact in a network of health
     services that functions as a system--especially in regional
     and local areas--improve the consistency and the
     complementarity of sectoral and intersectoral policies and
     programs in reducing the fragmentation of the organizations
     and the dichotomy between sectoral institutions and civil
     society, and achieve intense and coordinated mobilization
     and productive utilization of the resources available for
     population groups for the purpose of increasing coverage and
     resolving their priority health problems.


     COMPONENT 3:   Review of Sectoral Financing

     Concurrently with the transformations proposed in the
     organization, operation, scope, and strategies of sectoral
     action, the challenge emerges of reviewing the procedures
     for financing and channeling the expenditure on health. 
     Economic and financial criteria should be considered as
     determinants in evaluating the alternatives for
     incorporating the changes pursued by the aforementioned
     components into models for the development of health. 
     Furthermore, any transformations that are achieved should
     gear the decisions made regarding the allocation and
     application of national resources for health to achieving
     more intense and decided mobilization in accordance with the
     priorities of development in a framework of stability,
     productivity, equity, and social progress.

     COMPONENT 4.   Development of Strategic Administration at
the Local Level
 
     Within the context of policies of decentralization for the
     purpose of expanding participatory democracy that are linked
     to the need for establishing strategies to resolve the
     particular health problems of specific social groups
     deriving from particular conditions of life in a given
     historical time and place, the need arises for organizing
     comprehensive health actions and programs at the local level
     that are consistent with the needs and expectations of
     specific population groups by integrating the knowledge and
     resources of the various social actors making up such groups
     in a specific geographical space.  This makes it necessary
     to undertake a process of review and reformulation of the
     forms and instruments of local management through the use of
     a strategic approach that takes into account the objectives
     of development and social welfare adopted by these groups. 

     COMPONENT 5:   Development of Social Participation
     
     Both the concept and practical application of strategic
     administration at the local level are implicitly founded on
     the broadest possible social participation of the population
     groups and the institutions involv
