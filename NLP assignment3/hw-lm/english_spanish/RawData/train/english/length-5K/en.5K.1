MUSCULOSKELETAL DEVELOPMENT:



PHYSICAL AND MENTAL DIFFICULTY OF THE TASKS



PROGRESSIVE ELIMINATION OF THE MOST PHYSICALLY
DEMANDING TASKS



ERGONOMIC ADAPTATION OF WORK (TAKING INTO ACCOUNT
THE CHARACTERISTICS OF GROUPS, THE SEVERITY OF RISK
FACTORS, AND THE LEVELS OF CAPACITY)

WOMEN, WORK, AND OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH

Data that should be taken into account in preparing a
   NATIONAL PLAN FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF WORKERS' HEALTH 



MULTICENTER ACTIVITY TO BE DEVELOPED IN VARIOUS
COUNTRIES, AND SUGGESTIONS:

Argentina
Brazil
Colombia
Cuba
Guatemala
Guyana
Mexico



OBJECTIVES:

Understand the legal framework and determine its conformity with
international instruments

Determine the degree of enforcement of legislation, regulations, and
standards

Gain an appreciation of the real situation



MOBILIZATION OF RESOURCES AND SUPPORT:

Focal points for woman, health, and development

Focal points for workers' health

Human and material resources to be identified


WOMEN, WORK, AND OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH



Key areas of activity to be studied:* 


NURSES


TEACHERS AND EDUCATORS


OFFICE WORKERS


TEXTILE INDUSTRY


CHEMICAL AND PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY


FINE WELDING


ASSEMBLY PLANTS


FARM WORKERS (PESTICIDES)


DOMESTIC OCCUPATIONS





*          Because they employ large numbers of women and involve activities with high
levels of risk and low levels of protection and prevention.
WOMEN, WORK, AND OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH
Hypotheses for future scenarios:

RAPID INTEGRATION OF WOMEN INTO ALL OCCUPATIONS--
FACILITATED BY POLICIES FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF
OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH AND HUMAN RESOURCES--UNTIL THEY
REPRESENT APPROXIMATELY 50% OF THE WORK FORCE


This presupposes:                

A better division of labor
A reduction of the risk factors to which women are exposed
Adaptation of work to women's capabilities


This represents:

A basic frame of reference for equality and defense against
discrimination


This facilitates:

Equality of obligations, responsibilities, self-esteem, and responsible
competitiveness


SLOW INCREASE IN THE INTEGRATION OF WOMEN INTO MALE-
DOMINATED OCCUPATIONS 

This presupposes:

Maintenance of the current division of labor, with women remaining in
the most demanding, lowest-paying positions in which there is the least
opportunity for advancement 


This represents:

Continuation of the situation of inequality
