 the project, the research component
     is considered basic to achieving the proposed objectives.  It
     is felt that in this subcomponent, various techniques can be
     utilized, depending on the desired scope and degree of
     complexity.  In all possible cases, it will be attempted to
     use participatory research as part of a strategy whose aim is
     to involve the community in learning about and solving their
     own problems.  Unquestionably, the variants of this
     methodology--action-oriented research, self-study, and self-
     assessment--will be used to fuse together the participation
     of the technicians and the population during the different
     phases of the research process.

     The research component will seek to provide the basic tools
     for:

     a)   Learning about the gender relationships that occur in the
traditional ethnic groups and during the acculturation
process, as a means of individually breaking down the
problems that arise from these relationships.

     b)   Learning about the types of ethnomedical specializations
that are found in these communities, and about how the
men or women who are specialists (traditional health
workers, or THWs) obtain their knowledge.

     c)   Learning about the idea system employed by the THWs with
respect to the workings of the female body, the diseases
specific to women, and the types of ethnotherapy used. 

     d)   Learning about the networks that are derived from such
knowledge, especially in the woman-world and woman-man
binomials.

     e)   Learning about the types of popular ethnotherapeutic
practices and common procedures that are used in
diagnosis and therapy for the diseases that afflict women
as subjects and in their referential relationships.

     f)   Learning about the popular therapeutic practices in the
area of maternal and child health, including the popular
dietary practices of mothers whose children present
diarrhea symptoms and the common procedures for
diagnosing disease.

     g)   Learning about the therapeutic practices utilized by the
THWs, including the specific steps of a cure as well as
the medicines used, and showing how Western medicine
would cure the patient and how the two therapeutic
methods could be combined. 

     h)   Identifying the positive and negative factors that
influence the work carried out by the THWs from the
perspective of gender.

     i)   Showing which traditional practices are useful and which
are not, for the purpose of assessing endogenous
therapeutic resources. 

     j)   Showing the relationships that exist between the
acculturation process and the problems of gender and
mental health.

     k)   Analyzing the medical practices utilized by hospitals and
health posts to be able to enter into concrete-
operational areas as a means of understanding how Western
medicine is used.

     l)   Learning about and describing health systems that are
found to be able to use the natural resources in a
locality as the raw material for the therapeutic process,
and using this information as a basis for facilitating
policies aimed at reducing the high costs of importing
drugs.

     3.3.2 Training and Organization.

     The training component is designed to give a satisfactory
     response to the needs of the women and the communities
     selected.  This component envisages three types of training
     or training services:  training for research; training for
     health; and training for development and organization.

A. Training for research.

As a methodological proposal, this area will try to
involve indigenous women in learning about and solving
their own problems, preparing them to participate
actively in the decision-making process and in the
execution of some or all phases of the research to be
carried out under the project.

The principal objective of this type of training is to
train a certain number of indigenous women to serve as
bilingual aides in the research process.  Women with
training in this area can intervene constructively in the
detailed planning of the research process and the
collection, preparation, and interpretation of data.  The
training that being planned combines both theory and
practice, and the latter will be strengthened throughout
the research process.  The proposed methodology has
already been used in a project carried out in Guatemala,
where it has proved to be technically viable.

The ideal profile would include an adequate number of
bilingual indigenous women who have completed their
education to at least the secondary level.

The major outlines of this subcomponent are:

a)   To train the selected women to write their mother
tongue. 

b)   To train the selected women in the anthropology of
interethnic relations so that they are able to
revitalize their own identity in the acculturation
process by recognizing their own cultural patterns,
as well as to develop the capacity to interact with
people from different cultures with attitudes of
