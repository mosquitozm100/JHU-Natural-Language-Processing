suspended in March 1988.  In 1990, for the beginning of the
harvest, the National Malaria Eradication Service coordinated the
antimalarial measures to be carried out in border areas and in the
inlets jointly with the State Sugar Council, with a view to
avoiding increased incidence of malaria.  Unfortunately, there was
a mass entry of Haitians during the month of December, which
obliged the Malaria Program to expand coverage of epidemiological
surveillance nationwide, to ensure that the immigrants were given
the treatment of combined antimalarial drugs and registered by the
field staff of the NMES.
SURINAME 

     Due to hostilities in the interior of the country, where
transmission of malaria continues to be high, the control program
planned was not carried out; there was only a series of house
sprayings in areas where the hostilities diminished in intensity.

     During the year, 18,594 blood samples were examined, of which
1,608 were positive, while the previous year 23,364 blood samples
were examined, with 1,704 positives.VENEZUELA 

     Of the 46,910 malaria cases registered in Venezuela in 1990,
26,602 (56.7%) were from the state of Bolívar, for an annual
parasitic incidence in that state of 29.5 per 1,000 population. 
Of the malaria cases diagnosed in the state of Bolívar, 85% were
from the jungle areas, where mining activities are under way.  In
these areas the presence of the vector is permanent, dwellings are
precarious, access is difficult, and health services infrastructure
is lacking.  Preliminary data obtained in four indigenous and four
mining communities located in the mining region of the state of
Bolívar indicated a general prevalence of parasitemia of 4.1% (5.9%
among the indigenous population and 2.9% in the miners); nearly 70%
of the 1,353 persons interviewed had a history of malaria in the
last two years; one-third of the people who became ill with malaria
received treatment through the national control service.  The
others did not get treatment, or did so consulting with
pharmacists, healers, neighbors, or private physicians.

     The state of Sucre accounts for 14.6% of malaria cases in the
country; it has an API of 10.1 per 1,000 population.  Incidence is
still high because operational and administrative problems persist
that stand in the way of proper application of the antimalarial
measures in the entire state.  The largest share of the cases come
from the municipality of Santa Fe.

     The federal territory of Amazonas accounted for 10.6% of the
cases; it registered a 71.4% increase the number of cases from the
previous year, and annual parasitic incidence of 89.1 per 1,000
population.  This area represents the malarious area that cannot
be reached because of the problems of communication and access to
the jungle.

     The state of Apure (API of 6.5 per 1,000 persons), with 3.9%
of the cases, had an increase of 67.4% in relation to the previous
year, mainly from the process of colonization in the southwest
Andean region, in the municipalities of San Camilo and Urdaneta. 
The corresponding percentages for the states are:  Táchira 2.7%,
API=1.6; Monagas 1.7%, API=1.7%; Anzoátegui 1.7%, API=0.9; and
federal territory of Delta Amacuro 1.1%, API=5.9.

     It should be noted that a large proportion of the cases
diagnosed in the states in the maintenance phase are in general
imported from the states of Bolívar and Sucre.

     The treatment routinely provided by the program consists of
Chloroquine + Primaquine for infections by P.vivax and Amodiaquine
+ Primaquine for infections by P. falciparum.  Resistant cases of
P. falciparum are treated with Sulfadoxine + Pyrimethamine or
Quinine. 

Causes Affecting the Persistence of Malaria

     A series of biological, social, and administrative factors
have helped maintain the transmission of malaria.  Among the
biological aspects are the following:

·    The vector An. nuñeztovari, with exophilic and exophagic
     habits, avoids contact with the insecticide administered
     through intradomiciliary spraying, resulting in partially
     refractory malaria (north of Apure, Barinas, and Táchira).

·    An. darlingi is present in the jungle.  There it is found both
     within and outside of dwellings, which makes it less
     vulnerable to the insecticides.

·    The An. aquasalis vector mosquito in the state of Sucre is
     refractory to traditional spraying measures. 

·    The presence of infections caused by P. falciparum resistant
     to the four aminoquinolines, and to the association of sulfa
     drugs and pyrimethamine.

The social aspects that merit mention are:

·    Major migratory flows in the western part of the country,
     along the border with Colombia (Cúcuta-San Cristóbal and
     Táchira and also Puerto Carreño-Puerto Ayacucho), of day
     laborers who are carriers of parasites from malarious areas.

·    Areas characterized by foci of malaria that cannot be reached
     with rudimentary dwellings and a nomadi
