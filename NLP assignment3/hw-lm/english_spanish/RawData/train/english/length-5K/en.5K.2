e subject of
confidentiality in such a way that it corresponds to the daily
reality of individuals without succumbing to vague, substanceless
generalizations? 

     Unfortunately, I cannot answer that question.  I can only
say that local authorities should bear in mind not just the
epidemiological situation in the environment but also the social
and economic context, the community's level of knowledge and
assimilation of the information, and its willingness to deal with
the subject.

     Let us now examine the second case.  In it, Antonio is
mistreated by health personnel, who not only fail to provide him
with the medical care and attention that he requires but also
condemn him morally, showing no compassion whatsoever at a time
when he is most in need of understanding and support.  What
ethical and legal issues does this case raise?

     The treatment that Antonio receives is directly related to
his condition as an HIV-infected individual.  The case
exemplifies the discrimination to which AIDS patients and HIV-
infected people are subjected.  This situation is extremely
serious in the context of a broader policy on AIDS prevention and
control for the reasons that I will explain below.

     Equality before the law and the right to be protected from
discrimination constitute the foundation for both civil and human
rights.  The prohibition of discrimination is nothing more than
an attempt to ensure that the law offers the same opportunities
and is applied alike for all individuals.  Moreover, the right to
equal treatment is based on the conviction that all human beings
are created equal.  We are all therefore equally entitled to
develop ourselves and live normal lives within our own
possibilities.

     Let us recall the many international instruments that
consecrate the protection of human rights and in one way or
another prohibit discrimination on the basis of race, color, sex,
language, religion, political or other opinions, national or
social origin, economic status, birth, or any other status or
condition.  In these terms, AIDS and HIV infection would
constitute a specific status or condition and thus not be
justification for discriminatory treatment.

     Nevertheless, what happens in many cases with AIDS patients
or HIV-infected individuals?  In view of the fact that the
symptoms of the disease may not become apparent for years, should
the person be deprived of a normal life in the interim?  The
World Health Organization has taken a firm stance in this regard. 
Its position was ratified during the Forty-first World Health
Assembly in 1987, which adopted a resolution on the avoidance of
discrimination against HIV-infected people and people with AIDS. 
This resolution urges the 166 Member States of the World Health
Organization to foster a spirit of understanding and compassion
for HIV-infected people and people with AIDS through information,
education, and social support programs.  

     The experience accumulated in national and local AIDS
programs indicates that as the public gains more knowledge and
information about the disease, irrational fears concerning HIV
and its transmission tend to decrease.  Nevertheless, I must
point out that, unfortunately, even though people are aware that
HIV cannot be transmitted through casual contact, specific,
individual cases of HIV-infected children or adults with AIDS
often give rise to scandals, outrageous commentary in the
sensationalist press, and extreme reactions of rejection based on
deeply rooted biases held by society.

     This insistence on protection of the human rights and
dignity of persons who have AIDS or are infected with HIV is
founded on clear and powerful public health reasons to which I
have already alluded.  If HIV infection, or even the mere
suspicion of such infection, leads to stigmatization and
discrimination in the form of refusal of medical and hospital
care (as in the case of Antonio) or loss of employment, isolation
or quarantine, forcible separation from family, expulsion from
school, loss of housing, or any other similar situation, there is
great danger that the disease will spread unchecked, since
infected persons will choose to keep their condition a secret,
thereby hampering epidemiological prevention and control efforts.

     Thus, it is clear that protection of the human rights and
dignity of HIV-infected people, people with AIDS, and members of
population groups with risk-prone behavior is not a luxury but a
need.  It is essential to understand that it is a fallacy to view
this issue as a dilemma pitting the "rights of the many who are
uninfected" against the "rights of the few who are infected."  We
must realize that protection of the uninfected majority is
inextricably linked and ultimately dependant on protection of the
rights and dignity of infected persons. 

     It is for this reason that the World Health Organization has
urged the international network that exists for the protection of
human rights to endeavor t
