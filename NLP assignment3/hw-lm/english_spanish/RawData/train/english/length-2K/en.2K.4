OTHER ACTIVITIES


     In addition to the activities under the project described above, the Regional
Maternal and Child Health Program, through the Adolescent Health Unit and the
Units for Women and Children, will continue to carry out basic technical
cooperation activities with the countries of the Region in already existing areas.

a)   Mobilization of resources both within PAHO and with other agencies,
     particularly UNFPA, UNICEF, WHO, and NGOs (Carnegie Corporation,
     Pew Charitable Trust, IYF, and others).  Mobilization of scientific
     associations in the countries, subregions, and Region as strategic
     instruments or mechanisms for the implementation of new initiatives and for
     the strengthening of programs at the national, subregional, and Regional
     level.

b)   The distribution of scientific and educational material to institutions in the
     countries will also be a priority. 

c)   Direct technical assistance to the countries--especially in the development of
     plans and programs through PAHO/WHO resources and short-term
     consultants--will continue to be provided to the extent possible.  Technical
     resources in the countries will continue to be mobilized to support other
     countries.

d)   Support for health services research, including operational, epidemiological,
     and evaluative aspects, will also be continued. 

e)   The inclusion of topics relating to adolescence will be gradually
     incorporated into courses sponsored by the Program in the areas of maternal
     and child health and management at both the international and national
     levels.
