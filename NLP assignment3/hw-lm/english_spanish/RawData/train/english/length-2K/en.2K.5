dangerous accumulation of solid
wastes, growing industrial and vehicle contamination, and
deterioration in the environment and health caused by the
unrestricted use of pesticides.  The three remaining projects are
oriented to strengthening the first four by strengthening
institutional capacity, environmental education for citizens and
professionals, and evaluation of the impact that development
works have on the environment and health.

     The seven projects can be considered a whole in a matrix of
close interrelationships in which there are activities of
synergistic complementarity and strengthening.

     Within this context, and taking as an example the Education
on the Environment and Health Project, the strategic element of
MASICA is to develop and establish plans, programs,
methodologies, and educational activities whose results will make
it possible to increase knowledge and establish habits and
attitudes which guarantee better health status, an increase in
the quality of life, and behavior which promotes rational use and
conservation of natural resources, thus constituting a basis for
conducting the training component of the substantive programs.

     While the Education Project is oriented toward the citizenry
in order to produce changes in behavior which facilitate the
achievement of the objectives of the substantive projects, the
objective of the training component of such projects is to
provide training in the acquisition of specialized knowledge and
skills to learn to "do things" and resolve problems in their
specific fields of action:  water, refuse, industrial wastes, and
sustainable development planning.

2.  STRATEGIES FOR CARRYING OUT THE MASICA PROGRAM


     The fundamental strategy for carrying out the MASICA Program
as a whole is to strengthen interinstitutional coordination of
the counterpart organizations in each project and to take
advantage of already existing structures, jurisdictions, and
facilities rather than to create a new apparatu
