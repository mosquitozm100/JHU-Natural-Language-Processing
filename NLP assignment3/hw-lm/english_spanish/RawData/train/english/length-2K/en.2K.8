mosquito Aedes
aegypti.  In 1991, cases of dengue hemorrhagic fever were
recorded in Brazil, Colombia, Honduras, and Venezuela.  Only
Canada, the Cayman Islands, Chile, Costa Rica, and Uruguay can be
considered free from this vector.  The Organization cooperated in
Aedes aegypti control and surveillance with Brazil, Colombia,
Ecuador, Panama, Uruguay, Venezuela, and the countries of Central
America.  In addition, it prepared jointly with El Salvador,
Guatemala, and Honduras a trinational dengue control plan to
reduce the vector's density to levels which do not permit
transmission; strengthen epidemiological surveillance systems;
increase the response capacity of the general health services,
and achieve the participation of the population in preventing and
combating the disease.  It also promoted and organized an
international meeting to draw up guidelines for the dengue
prevention and control programs in the Americas, as well as a
meeting in Barbados to strengthen the information systems of
national Aedes aegypti control programs in which representatives
from the Ministries of Health of Martinique and Trinidad and
Tobago participated.
     With the collaboration of WHO's Parasitic Diseases Program,
it organized and carried out an informal consultation to define
regional guidelines for parasitic disease prevention and control
programs.  Finally, PAHO/WHO cooperated in rodent surveillance
and control activities in Anguilla, Dominica, Montserrat, and
Saint Lucia.
(Last part of chapter IV.E)
     Many activities to control sexually transmitted diseases
(STDs) were implemented, reflecting the Government's renewed
interest in halting the transmission of these diseases.
     At the scientific and technical level, the VIII Meeting of
the Latin American Union Against Sexually Transmitted Diseases
(ULACETS), held at Santo Domingo, served as a forum for
discussing STD laboratory needs as well as necessary
multidisciplinary support of medical and behavioral interventions
for ST
