t of local negotiating capacity for consensus
and management with regard to local health systems
(COR, ELS, HON, NIC, PAN).

     5.4  Training of health personnel for community work (HON,

     It is recognized that the logical relation of causality
     between the lines of action presently indicated for the
     first year and the outcomes expected at the end of the
     Project is not completely coherent; however, it is assumed
     that they should be used as a point of departure in
     preparing the first national work plans to specify the
     initial activities in the lines of action considered to be
     of a priority nature and to indicate the local health
     systems in which this is feasible.

     This option is considered to be fully valid, since, while
     respecting the current expectations of the countries, it
     provides the opportunity for identifying and reformulating
     the actions that must be taken in order to attain the
     expected results through in-service apprenticeship in the
     real environment of the local levels.  Successive
     evaluations and programmings will provide feedback for this
     preliminary assessment, and the new lines of action decided
     upon will be incorporated into the Project document.

     As a result, once the Project is approved, the next step
     will be the preparation of local programs for the
     formulation of national plans, which will be consolidated in
     the Annual Subregional Work Plan, to which will be added
     activities it is considered desirable to carry out at the
     subregional level in accordance with the principles of
     subsidiarity and economy of scale. 
VIIIBUDGET FOR THE FIRST YEAR

     The Project budget for the first year has first been
     organized generically and indicatively by each of the five
     components and then distributed according to cooperation
     mechanisms and resources.
