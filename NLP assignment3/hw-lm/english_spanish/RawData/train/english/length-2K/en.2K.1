Management is trying innovative strategies aimed at humanizing the work environment. 
It recognizes that it is essential to adapt work to the characteristics of human beings and
promote their aware participation in the planning, execution, and evaluation of their jobs,
with a view to bringing about a change in old styles of organization and management in
today's modern societies and in those that are in the process of modernization, as well as
promoting studies and new attitudes that will result in well-being and active participation
by workers.  This new type of management is certain that prevention and health in the
workplace, as effected by occupational health experts, will facilitate dialogue, increase
productivity and earnings, and help to improve morale among workers, and it therefore
seeks a rapid increase in the number of professionals and technicians, who are essential
for optimizing management capacity.

The spiraling costs of curative care and rehabilitation, as well as compensation for
disabilities resulting from work-related accidents and diseases, are an added incentive in
the search for effective and economic solutions aimed at controlling and eliminating risk
factors in the workplace.  The assignment of priority to prevention helps to reduce the
numbers of serious and incapacitating accidents and diseases, which results not only in
increased social well-being but also in greater productivity and overall quality.

The close relationship between deteriorating health, low productivity, and low
socioeconomic status has been one of the primary factors that has demonstrated the
necessity of stepping up joint promotion of activities by governments, private enterprise,
and workers, or the institutions represent them.  It has been demonstrated that in the
developing countries the negative results of bad health and working conditions are more
traumatic and are more sharply felt than in the developed countries
