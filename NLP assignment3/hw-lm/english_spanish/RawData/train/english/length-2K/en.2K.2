    Incidence in the exposed population:    202/2218 = 91.07 per 1,000
    Incidence in the unexposed population:  81/2892 = 28.00 per 1,000

      RELATIVE RISK = 91.07 = 3.25
28.00

      ATTRIBUTABLE RISK = 91.07 - 28.00 = 63.07
(in the population exposed)

% ATTRIBUTABLE RISK = 91.07 - 28.00 x 100 = 69.25%
(in the population            91.07
exposed)

POPULATION ATTRIBUTABLE RISK  =     O.434 (3.25-1)   x 100 =
49.4%

where P = 2218/5110, and RR = 3.25


       Based on the results obtained in the foregoing example, for
this population during the time period studied the risk of becoming
ill with malaria was 3.25 times greater for individuals who lived
less than 500 meters from the breeding sites of vectors than for
those who live at a greater distance from such breeding sites.  For
those exposed (those who live near the breeding sites), as much as
69.25% of their malaria problem could be explained by this risk
factor, and up to 49.4% of the malaria problem in this population
could be resolved if this risk factor is causal and were to be
eliminated.

       It is important to point out that there are other possible
explanations for these results, and the presence of other
concomitant factors could interfere with the influence of a
particular risk
