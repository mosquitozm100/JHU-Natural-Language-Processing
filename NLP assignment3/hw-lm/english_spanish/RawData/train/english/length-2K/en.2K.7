   Mr. Milam explained that the purpose of including projections for 1994-1995 was
to give the Governments two separate opportunities to consider the portion of the
budget that was being allocated to their countries so that the budget could then be
brought into line with their criteria and program priorities.

   The Director emphasized that this preliminary version of the proposal did not
include a program analysis nor was in-depth consideration given to the five priority
programs indicated by the Director-General because, among other reasons, there
had not been sufficient opportunity to consult individually with the Governments
in order to determine what activities they proposed to carry out in their respective
countries.  This will be done in late 1992 when the joint PAHO/WHO budget is
prepared.

   With respect to the five priorities, the Director pointed out that there are
considerable variations between the different Regions and Governments, both with
regard to conceptualization and implementation.  He noted that in other Regions
the percentage allocated to these five priorities are:  Africa, 36.6%; South-
East Asia, 49.3%; Europe, 13.5%; Eastern Mediterranean, 51.4%; and Western
Pacific, 45.5%.  The figure for Headquarters in Geneva is 23.3%. 

   A comparison of the various Regions and of WHO Headquarters in terms of
increases or reductions in their share of the WHO budget also reveals a rather
uneven situation.  In the European Region, with the exception of one activity in
Turkey, all the resources are concentrated in the Regional Office, whereas in the
Americas emphasis is placed on the activities that are being carried out in the
countries.  Any comparison should therefore take into account the level of
development of the countries as well as the way in which technical cooperation is
delivered to them.  The Director pointed out that the Western Pacific and the
Americas are the Regions that have suffered the largest reducti
