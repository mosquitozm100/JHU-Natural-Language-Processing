LEGISLATIVE INSTRUMENTS AT THE NATIONAL LEVEL

      In the countries, legislation and regulations on the subject of
working women most often refer to maternity protection, but some
legislation also focuses on minor female workers, night work, working
hours, work in mines, heavy labor, and hazardous and insalubrious working
conditions.

      Almost all the countries provide for maternity leave before and
after delivery amounting to a total of at least four months.

      Maternity benefits usually include subsidies during maternity leave
plus medical benefits.  In addition to medical care for the mother and the
newborn, there is often provision for assistance related to breast-feeding.

      Legislation relating to job security includes prohibition against
discharging a woman during the period when she has the right to maternity
leave, and in many countries this protection is extended for a longer
period.
