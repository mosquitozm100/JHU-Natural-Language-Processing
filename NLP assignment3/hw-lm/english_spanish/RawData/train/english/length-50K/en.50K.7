thropology but there is little integration into the content of the professional courses.Recognizing the importance of sociocultural factors
in the profession, practical work in aspects related to rural sociology, health education, or social communication has been initiated.The school
demonstrates the importance of and interest in sociocultural aspects through curriculum development, supplementing that with extension and
research activities and specific projects involving the participation of students, instructors, professionals, and the community.Manpower
development policy

12. Only estimates of the number of veterinarians in existence are available.  There is a need to define the profile of the professional in keeping
with the strategy of veterinary public health.

There is information on the number of professionals available, and the school utilizes it to establish curricula, mainly following a profile derived
from traditional practice.

The school, on the basis of a study of the needs of veterinarians, coordinates with the various sectors of the labor market, providing the quantity
and quality of professionals needed to contribute to the development and well-being of man.13. The policy of personnel training in veterinary
medicine is determined by the rare or very relative participation of the veterinarians who teach and those in professional practice.Manpower
training policy in veterinary medicine is defined by groups composed of veterinarians and other professionals through formal and/or informal
mechanisms.  However, its relationship to a general policy of manpower development is weak.Manpower training policy in veterinary medicine
integrates the general policy of manpower development in health and agriculture and is defined through formal mechanisms with the participation
of veterinarians from the different areas.14. The school receives the decisions on the number of entrants per year from the university; there is
little participation in the decision-making.The faculty participates in planning the number of entrants per year on the basis of projections of the
needs of the population, national policies, and possibilities of employment.The school plans the number admitted per year according to the needs,
health and labor policies, and the demand for veterinarians.  It participates actively in the search for mechanisms and resources to adapt the
demand to the needs.Social basis of veterinary practice

15. The conditions in veterinary practice that facilitate and guarantee the full exercise of the profession are considered as matters that concern
the employing institutions and the individuals, outside the purview of the school.

The curriculum envisages working conditions that facilitate and guarantee full exercise of the profession, with joint activities with professional
associations.

Throughout its curriculum development, the school, taking into account the utilization of the veterinarian under the various working conditions,
promotes the full exercise of the profession and takes an active role in this process.Entrance requirements

16. The previous education of the student is taken into account, in requesting as an entrance requirement the years of previous schooling and/or
the level of academic performance of the student.

The school considers prior preparation in biological and social sciences and certain abilities, such as reading, drafting, and communicating,
important and includes them in the criteria for admission.

In admitting new students to the university, the faculty compares their previous preparation in basic, exact, social, and natural sciences in relation
to a set of criteria that include an analysis of skills in addition to academic performance.  I have designed mechanisms to facilitate the
development of these attributes in the applicants that do not possess them.
S T R U C T U R E

Organization of the school -  Management of knowledge

17. The institutional structure promotes independent development of the various health professions.  Integration is sporadic and informal.


The institutional structure provides mechanisms through which the students develop joint activities with other health professions through specific
coordinated works.


As an integral part of its institutional structure the school includes educational activities in veterinary public health in multidisciplinary teams, both
theoretical and practical.18. The school is organized on the basis of isolated disciplines that are the responsibility of independent
departments.The school is organized into departments that unite various disciplines or subjects.The school organizational structure facilitates
the representation of various areas in the different units.19. The organization of the curriculum reflects a lack of integration, rote learning, and
repetition of subject matter.The curriculum follows an organizational model that permits horizontal and vertical articulation but that depends on
the desire of the various chiefs of departments or units to participate.The structure of the curriculum is directed toward the processes of health
and development.  This requires the integration of various areas of knowledge in addition to their logical, continuous presentation.20.  In the
structure of the curriculum, the school emphasizes the clinical and therapeutic aspects.In the structure of the curriculum, the study unit is oriented
toward the sick animal and incorporates elements of livestock production, risks to man's health, and planning.In the structure of the curriculum,
the unit of study includes clinical, epidemiological, and managerial aspects, enabling veterinary public health to contribute to health and
development.21. Program activities are based on objectives that do not include definition of the minimum competence of the graduates.Program
activities are guided by objectives that include specific competencies of the graduates in veterinary medicine, which are derived from profiles
developed individually for each subject.Program activities are based on objectives that specify an occupational profile of skills for the graduates,
emphasizing the contribution of veterinary medicine to the solution of problems in order to achieve the goals of health and development.Relation
to the organization of the services

22. The structure of the school bears little relation to the organization of the services; there is some development through certain programs for
control of specific diseases of animals.  Existence of agreements for student practice in the area of food protection.

The organization of the school corresponds to the services of zoonoses, production, and animal health, reflecting limited connections with the
new fields in veterinary public health.

The structure of the school provides several mechanisms (for example, agreements) that ensure a close relationship with the organization of
the veterinary public health services in such areas as food protection, biotechnology, control and eradication of zoonoses, development of
biomedical models, and protection of the environment.23. In the constitution of a practical base, the school has access to and/or utilizes a
limited number of services, which restricts the development of their programs.For the development of the practical base, the school utilizes a
variety of services, thus ensuring adaptation of its programs.The school utilizes for its programs a variety of different services that in their
entirety constitute broad populational and organizational bases and represent the elements of a comprehensive veterinary public health
system.Structural flexibility

24. There are committees in the school to examine necessary changes.  They tend to be limited to curricular aspects and there are long delays
in making adjustments.

Through institutional and structural integration, the school has mechanisms that permit adjustments without a long process.  Within every subject
the changes are relatively easily accomplished.

The school has dynamic mechanisms that facilitate and generate processes of transformation according to need.  There is continuous updating
of the curriculum; the absence of this represents instability.Research

25. The organization of the school indicates a low priority for research.  When it is included, it is isolated.

The organization of the school indicates a recognition of the need for research.  It provides means for its development but there is very little
linkage with the services and teaching.

In the organization of the school, research is considered of fundamental importance to the country in the educational and service processes;
it is incorporated into the theoretical and practical aspects of the curriculum.Social communication and extension

26. In the structure of the school, extension activities are located in such a way that their importance is minimized.

The structure of the school permits the realization of activities of social communication, without much substantive development.

The place occupied by social communication and extension in the organization of the school demonstrates the relevance of these activities to
the mission of the university in the national context.Administrative support

27. The structure of the school only encourages coordination between administrative and educational activities in limited instances, each being
developed independently.

The overall structure of the school facilitates the coordination of the administrative and teaching activities, but two separate structures are
maintained for them.

The school utilizes an administrative structure that prioritizes the management of education, extension, and research.28. In the preparation and
administration of the budget, the school has little access to the decision-making process.The school prepares the budget and administers it, but
enjoys limited participation in the decision-making related to its approval.The school prepares its budget, participates in the related decision-
making, and administers it.Access to bibliographic information

29. The school has a limited library and does not have a budget devoted to its maintenance.  The information is concentrated in books and there
are few journals and offprints.  The available journals are often not appropriate for the curriculum content or because of their language.

The school has a library of books and nontraditional materials, adequate in quantity and quality.  There are Latin American and other journals
available with relevant information for the development of the programs of the school and there is a reference system that allows access to
bibliographic information outside the school.

The school has introduced automated systems for access to information that are connected with other schools and international reference
libraries.Availability of audiovisual aids

30. The school has limited audiovisual aids, acquired through commercial catalogs, to illustrate the teaching presentations.

The school has an adequate quantity of audiovisual aids to illustrate the lectures but the possibilities of their being updated are limited.

The school has and updates its audiovisual aids for illustration of the lectures.  In addition, it cultivates and maintains an active exchange with
other teaching and research centers.Structure of the faculty

31. The school, in establishing criteria for selecting faculty members, pays little attention to specialization and/or professional experience in the
specific area.

The school has determined criteria for selection of the members of its teaching staff that include scientific and technical preparation and/or
experience in their specialization.

The criteria for selection of instructors include scientific and technical preparation and experience in their area of the work, in addition to  the
abilities needed to conduct research.32. The faculty consists of a group of instructors that participate very little in the practice of the profession
after they are named.With the support of the school, the teaching staff is composed of personnel that engages in the practice of veterinary
medicine without regulation.The faculty is fully incorporated in the practice of veterinary medicine through varied mechanisms; this facilitates
its continuous updating.
F U N C T I O N

Relationship of theory to practice

33. The theory is taught in accordance with a preestablished program.  The practical experiences bear little relation to the theoretical.

Because the theory and practice are planned separately, they are related through coordinating mechanisms.

The interrelationship of the theoretical and practical elements of the curriculum is comprehensive, stemming from a single program basis.34.
The teaching and learning processes are carried out mainly in the lecture hall.  The practical experiences lack planning and the teaching in this
regard is occasional.The teaching and learning processes are carried out both in the classroom and in practice although sometimes the emphasis
is different in the two aspects.The processes of teaching and learning are carried out in varied situations with integrated emphasis and content.35.
The school selects some practices for the students to learn, with priority on technological development.The school takes the analysis of
technological development into account in its curriculum.  In the selection of experiences for students, it takes into account the appropriate
utilization of technology, but this is given a low priority.The school takes into account and participates in the critical analysis of technological
developments in the practice, assessing to what degree it utilizes and produces technologies that respond to its needs.  Students are given
experience in the rational utilization of technology.36. Participation of the nonteaching personnel in the public and private sectors is minimal or
tangential to the development of the curriculum.Nonteaching personnel in the private and public sectors participate with the instructors in the
identification of health problems and the areas to be emphasized in curriculum development.  Some participate in classroom
teaching.Nonteaching professionals in the private and official sectors participate fully in the different aspects of curriculum
development.Methodology

37. Professors utilize existing methods and means of transmission of knowledge that correspond to previously established behavior, which leads
to rote learning.

In some courses methodologies are utilized that promote the development of critical and analytical abilities in the students.

The faculty incorporates educational methods and means in the program so that the student develops critical and analytical abilities with regard
to the program contents and to their professional actions.38. The school utilizes a variety of educational materials in the more highly developed
media that are not adapted to the reality.There are departments that analyze and adapt educational materials produced for different media. 
Production in the school is minimal.The school identifies the needs for educational material; it searches for what exists, prepares it, or coordinates
its production.Evaluation

39. Curriculum evaluation is developed only to fulfill an administrative requirement and the results are not utilized for curriculum changes.

There are departments that carry out evaluations in an attempt to improve subjects and areas but the curriculum itself is not affected.

The school periodically develops an evaluation of its curriculum that is based on the political, economic, and social changes in the country and
an assessment of the performances of the graduates.40. Evaluation of the students is individual and measures almost exclusively the capacity
to repeat theoretical material with little or no emphasis being placed on the practice.Evaluation of the students provides a balanced measure
of the development of aptitudes and knowledge, the degree of conceptualization, and analytical capacity, as well as practical abilities.The school
favors self-evaluation by the student and by the professor, emphasizing the capacity for analysis and the solution of problems.41. Evaluation
of the teaching and learning processes is utilized informally and sporadically through evaluation of the faculty.Evaluation of the teaching and
learning processes is continuous through evaluation of the faculty.Evaluation of the teaching and learning processes is a mechanism integrated
into the curriculum for analysis of the performance of the school, along with the educational methodologies and the performance of the
graduate.Updating (training)

42. The activities to update the instructors constitute particular actions to meet the individual interests of the professors.  The school supports
the activities with blocks of time or salary but does not initiate or encourage them.

The activities of updating involve continuing education through courses with clear objectives and defined programming, to improve technical
knowledge in fields specifically related to the teaching and learning processes.

The subjects to be updated are chosen on the basis of needs identified by the school, by professional groups, and by the services.  They are
framed within a concept of continuing education.43. The school has few professors with pedagogical training, which is acquired as a result of
personal interest on the part of the instructor and not as a requirement of the school.The school encourages pedagogical preparation and
establishes opportunities and programs for continuous training in order to develop the teaching skills of all the instructors.The school has a
program of continuing education for its personnel, thus facilitating the application by the school of the pedagogical principles and techniques that
the institution has selected.44. The activities of continuing education are scarce and directed only toward the professionals in veterinary
medicine.The school has developed a formal program of continuing education for the professional veterinarian in which participation in some
events is open to other professionals.The school has a permanent program of continuing technical and scientific education that leads to the
development of knowledge and the transformation of the reality.  It is incorporated in multidisciplinary groups for certain programs.Production
of scientific knowledge

45. Research is generated by the particular interests of the investigators with no priorities established by the school.

Some units of the school have defined lines of research based on their area of work or on the possibilities of budgetary support.

The school defines lines of research in accordance with the needs of the profession, the educational process, and the population.46. Research,
when it is carried out, is done sporadically, and is not formally incorporated into the programs.Research is a formal activity in the curriculum; it
is carried out at several levels with emphasis on biological and pathological aspects.Research forms the basis of the programming.  Emphasis
is placed on the social and epidemiological aspects, although some space is made for other kinds of research.47. The faculty publishes few
works, usually in the form of monographs to disseminate the results of its teaching, service, and research work.The faculty occasionally publishes
in the areas of its teaching, service, and research work.The faculty periodically publishes material on its teaching, service, and research work
in an established professional journal.Budgetary availability

48. The school budget allows it to fulfill only its teaching function and even this is limited.

The budget of the school allows it to fulfill its functions, with priority for education and care, or in some cases for the interests of certain
departments.

The budget of the school, for research and as well as for teaching, service, and extension, reflects its commitment to programs that respond to
the health needs of the population.49. The school makes few attempts to find sources of extrabudgetary financing for several reasons, among
which are lack of access and lack of information.The school occasionally seeks extrabudgetary sources of financing, usually at the national level
and through the initiative of some individual on the teaching staff.The school has the capacity and mechanisms to generate its own resources
(through advisory services and projects, for example), which has significance for the budget.
I N T E G R A T I O N

Conceptual framework (guidelines for the development of the institution)

50. The instructors are guided by their own systems of values, although the school might have unified the philosophy of veterinary medicine to
apply to curriculum development.  Therefore, their impact on the actions of the institution is rarely noted.


The instructors have determined the philosophic framework of the school.  The need to include representatives of the students, graduates, and
personnel of the services in its preparation is still not well-recognized and its review is sporadic.  However, it provides general guidelines for
the development of the teaching aspects.


The teaching personnel of the school, jointly with members of student groups, graduates, and service personnel, determines the philosophical
framework of all the institution's activities.  That framework is redefined periodically, as the situation demands.51. The school has a conceptual
framework of veterinary medicine in accordance with the health and development situation in the country, but its influence on curriculum
programming is limited.The school has a conceptual framework in accordance with the social, health, and development situation in the country;
this is more evident in the theoretical aspects than in the overall programming.In all its activities the school reflects a valid current conceptual
framework in accordance with the social, health, and development situation.Role of the school in the society

52. The school prepares human resources on the assumption that they participate in the process of the development of the country.

The school identifies its action in regard to manpower training with the process of development in the country.  With respect to extension and
research its response is more limited.

The school, through its functions of education, service, and research assumes a dominant role in promoting transformation of the health and
development situation, participating in the process of decentralization and in other forms of social change.53. The school participates with the
various social actors in the planning and/or evaluation of veterinary public health only when it is requested to do so.The school is represented
in coordinating committees for the planning and/or evaluation of veterinary public health activities.The school is actively involved with the
various social actors (health, agriculture, associations, veterinary school, private sector) in planning and evaluation related to public health.54.
The school participates in health services delivery only through the practice of the students.  It has little contact with its graduates for purposes
of improving veterinary care.The school, through its instructors and students, contributes to changes of orientation in practice.  There are
mechanisms for follow-up and the graduates are incorporated into this process.The school utilizes mechanisms to integrate instructors and
students, and also graduates, whom it involves in educational and research activities and in contributing to the veterinary practice of the
students.55. The school carries out its functions with a predominantly curative approach without prioritizing the activities of management and
preventive medicine.
In the development of the functions of the school the role of the veterinarian in health promotion and disease prevention is emphasized.  Material
on administration and the rural economy are incorporated.The school in the fulfillment of all its functions emphasizes the fields of action of
veterinary public health and management as axes of the professional activities of the veterinarian in the search for social transformation for health
and development.56. The school prepares the veterinarian to occupy a position on the health or agricultural team.  It discusses his role within
a multidisciplinary context in a limited way.The school of veterinary medicine considers the veterinarian as an independent professional member
of a multidisciplinary team.  This concept is made viable through its theoretical and practical content.The school considers multidisciplinary
teamwork and the capacity to make decisions with professional independence as basic; it participates actively in searching, planning, and
implementation that demonstrate these qualities and elements.57. In its teaching the school utilizes the results of research carried out by various
health professionals, but the actual research activities are minimal.The instructors, students, and graduates question the models of animal health
care, carrying out research on related problems.The instructors, students, and graduates of the school, forming interdisciplinary teams, participate
through the results of their research in the prevention and solution of the priority problems in veterinary public health.58. The school, through
its instructors, students, and graduates, participates in discussions (for example, scientific days) that tend to define the functions and bases of
the profession.The school, through its instructors, students, and graduates, organizes activities to discuss the nature of the profession,
using the existing theories as a basis.  The professional profile responds partially to the needs of the country.The school, through its instructors,
students, and graduates and with the help of the various social actors, assumes a significant role in research and other activities that tend to
define the profile of the veterinarian to include contributing to the resolution of problems related to health, food protection, the environment,
animal production and health, and the development of biomedical models.59. The school treats the subjects related to working conditions in the
profession very lightly, both in the theory and in the practice.The responsibility for improving working conditions in the profession is assumed
by the school as a line of action in the institutions where the students practice; the latter participate in a limited way in the discussion of the
curriculum.The school assumes a significant role in the improvement of working conditions in the profession.  It prepares the veterinarians to
take an active part in the search for the strategies and mechanisms that are conducive to good professional performance.The graduate of the
school in the society

60. The graduates of the school have knowledge, abilities, and skills in their field of work.  In the labor market they demonstrate their limitations
in analysis and research.

The graduates of the school demonstrate knowledge and abilities in the practice while at the same time conducting applied research to improve
the services.  Their critical attitudes are limited to their participation in review and improvement committees in their places of work.

The graduates of the school demonstrate knowledge, abilities, and professional aptitudes and perform efficiently.  They develop critical and
analytical aptitudes in their occupation in order to identify, through applied research and other activities, new ways to promote health and
development.61. The graduates accept the ethical values of the institution where they work.The graduates consciously apply professional values
in considering the environment.The graduates of the school have an ethical social conscience which they apply to social transformation.62. The
graduates of the school enter the labor market where they follow the existing lines of authority and standards.  They demonstrate a personal
interest but participate only in the application of some specific regional and local health programs.When they enter the labor market, the
graduates of the school demonstrate qualities of leadership, striving for the improvement of veterinary care and veterinary personnel.The
graduates of the school demonstrate capacities of leadership and management that are conducive to the transformation of health and
development.63. The graduates of the school see veterinary medicine as a dependent profession and a source of relatively secure
employment.The graduates of the school are identified with their profession and become leaders in its promotion.The graduates of the school
are fully identified with the profession, promoting its development in all areas.

     TOBACCO OR HEALTH


















ANALYSIS OF THE SITUATION

.    At least 90% of the deaths from
     lung cancer, 75% of those
     caused by chronic bronchitis,
     and 25% resulting from ischemic
     heart disease can be traced to
     smoking.

.    It is estimated that in the
     Americas smoking is associated
     with more than half a million
     avoidable premature deaths
     every year. 

.    In Canada and the United States
     of America, which have had
     prevention and control programs
     for more than two decades, a
     sustained decline in tobacco
     use has been observed, owing in
     large measure to the fact that
     many adults have given up the
     habit. 

.    In Latin America and the
     Caribbean, where only a few
     countries have national
     programs for prevention and
     control, it is estimated that
     tobacco use is increasing in
     some population groups,
     especially among adolescents
     and young women with stable
     incomes who live in urban
     areas.

PAHO PROGRAM ON TOBACCO OR HEALTH

The Governing Bodies of PAHO/WHO
have adopted a number of resolutions
urging the Governments and the
nongovernmental agencies to assume
a more active role in the fight
against the use of tobacco.

Activities in this regard have
included the convening of panels of
experts, the organization of
workshops, and the promotion of
policies, plans, and programs for
the prevention and control of
smoking in the countries.

The Organization cooperates in the
analysis of existing legislation and
in the promotion of legal measures
aimed at reducing the use of tobacco
and protecting the population
against its harmful effects.

As the culmination of this process,
PAHO/WHO has established a program
on "Tobacco or Health," the plan of
action for which is based on
Resolution XII of the XXXIV meeting
of the Directing Council (1989) and
is supported by the Ministers of
Health of the Region.

PAHO, in addition to promoting
awareness of the risks of smoking
and encouraging the implementation
of control measures in the
countries, provides technical
advisory services, identifies
critical areas and deficiencies,
collaborates with the countries in
the development of programs, and
cooperates in training and research.
OBJECTIVES OF THE PROGRAM

1. To promote public health measures
at  the Regional, subregional, and
national levels in order to reduce
the incidence and prevalence of
smoking and protect the health of
non-smokers, working to see that
their rights are upheld.

2. To ensure that future societies
and generations will remain "smoke-
free."




STRATEGIES AND PRIORITIES

The attainment of the ultimate
objectives of the program will be
facilitated by the adoption of
strategies for implementation of the
Regional Plan of Action for the
Prevention and Control of Smoking. 
This plan recommends concrete
control measures, including:

*    Promoting the development of
     policies, plans, and programs
     for the prevention and control
     of smoking.

*    Facilitating the mobilization
     of public opinion, the
     encouragement of appropriate
     political action, and the
     utilization of resources for
     prevention and control of the
     habit.

*    Facilitating the production,
     collection, and distribution of
     pertinent technical
     information.











LINES OF ACTION


1.  Development of policies, plans,
and programs

Promotion of policies, plans, and
programs on smoking.  Efforts in
this regard are aimed at raising
awareness of the health risks posed
by tobacco in the general public,
opinion groups, and decision-making
circles in order to promote the
adoption of clear-cut policies on
the problem.

2.  Mobilization of resources

Identification and mobilization of
all possible resources that could
contribute to execution of the
program:  mobilization of public
opinion, identification of
preeminent experts and centers,
determination of sources of
financing, utilization of social
networks, cooperation with involved
community groups.


3.  Dissemination of information

Collection, production,
dissemination, and exchange of
educational/informative material on
smoking.  Use of the mass media as
an instrument for prevention.


4.  Training

The Program supports short-term
training activities for personnel in
charge of formulating and
implementing programs for the
prevention and control of smoking.


5.  Research

The Program encourages and supports
research on the causes and
prevalence of smoking, as well as on
the effectiveness and impact of
prevention and control activities.


6.  Direct technical cooperation

Technical advisory services are
provided to the countries that
request them for the development of
national programs that are
compatible with the Program's lines
of action.  The Program arranges for
the services of experts and
cooperates in working group meetings
and activities of planning and
evaluation.
4.    Epidemiological Research on Malaria

      4.1   Introduction

      The need for epidemiological research on malaria can vary
greatly not just between countries but also from one locality to the
next.  The incidence of malaria as well as mortality from the disease
vary both geographically and with the social composition of
populations.  For example, in 1986, although just 3.8% of the
population of the Region of the Americas was living in the subregion
comprising Central America, Panama, and Belize, this area accounted for
123,000 cases of malaria, or 20% of the total number of cases in the
Region.  Within this subregion, Costa Rica and Panama had only 2% of
the cases, while 98% were concentrated in the five remaining countries
(PAHO, 1988:5).  Within these countries, it is possible to identify the
localities and population groups which account for the majority of
malaria cases and in which the probability of occurrence of the illness
is greater than in others places or groups.  It is therefore of vital
importance to identify the set of characteristics or factors in such
localities and groups that explain the increased probability of
becoming ill or dying of malaria.

      Recognition of the risk factors for malaria, and of the relative
importance of each of them, in each of the localities and population
groups during a specific period can be accomplished through
epidemiological research studies.  Epidemiological research seeks to
collect and organize information on the risk factors associated with
a higher risk of becoming ill with a disease, thereby contributing to
more complete knowledge of the epidemiological situation of that
disease.  In addition, it facilitates the establishment of a
population's risk profile and the selection of interventions aimed
specifically at modifying or eliminating this profile in high-
risk localities and groups. 

      The three basic assumptions that provide the rationale for
malaria research based on the epidemiological risk approach can be
stated as follows: 
      (1)   Within the malarious areas selected, it is possible to
identify, through indicators based on risk factors, certain
subgroups of the population in which the probability of
contracting malaria is greater than in the rest of the
population.

      (2)   Such subgroups account for a substantial proportion of the
morbidity from malaria that occurs in the total population.

      (3)   It is possible to increase the effectiveness and efficiency
of the general health services in the management of malaria
prevention and control interventions by rechanneling
activities and resources toward:
a.   the causal risk factors identified; and
b.   the individuals and groups that are at greatest risk
of contracting malaria.


      These three premises facilitate the formulation of research
objectives and hypotheses that will establish the correlation between
malaria and the various risk factors under study.

      4.2   Definition of Purposes and Objectives

      In all situations in which an epidemiological study of malaria
risk is to be carried out, it is fundamental that the purposes and
objectives of the research be rationally defined.

      One of the general objectives of epidemiological research on
malaria is to identify those individuals and social groups in malarious
areas who, by reason of their social, economic, or environmental living
conditions, are at very high risk of becoming ill or dying of malaria.

      4.3   Formulation of the Research Hypothesis

      Epidemiological research is conducted with a view to answering
certain specific questions, or hypotheses, relating to the frequency,
distribution, and determinants of malaria in various social groups.

      Thus, an initial step in epidemiological research is the
formulation of relevant questions that can be the subject of research. 
Such questions are presented in the form of one or more hypotheses. 
These hypotheses express the probable correlation that exists in the
study population between exposure to one or more risk factors and the
occurrence of an impairment to health, in this case malaria.

      RESEARCH HYPOTHESIS:

      An assumption or conjecture that is advanced to account
      for certain facts or events and is used as a basis for
      research which seeks to prove or disprove the hypothesis.
      (OMS/OPS, 1986:47)


      Well-formulated hypotheses lead to better-structured research. 
An example of a hypothesis for epidemiological research on malaria
might be the following:

      The individuals in locality "x" who lack regular access to
      medical care will have greater morbidity from malaria than those
      who have regular access to health services.


      The number of hypotheses will depend on the objectives and scope
of the research as well as on the number of risk factors under study. 
Most research hypotheses are stated in negative terms.  This way of
stating a hypothesis is known as a null hypothesis.

      NULL HYPOTHESIS:

      The statistical hypothesis that one variable has no
      association with another variable or set of variables...
      In simplest terms, the null hypothesis states that the
      results observed in a study, experiment, or test are no
      different from what might have occurred as a result of
      the operation of chance alone (Last:90).
      

      The basic reason for formulating a research hypothesis as a null
hypothesis is that the tests of statistical significance utilized in
the analysis of the hypothesis can only reject (or not reject) it when
they measure the probability that the results obtained in a study might
have occurred by chance.

      The null hypothesis corresponding to the research hypothesis
proposed above is as follows:

      There is no difference in terms of morbidity from malaria
      between the individuals of locality "x" who do not have regular
      access to medical care and those who do have regular access to
      health services.


       The formulation of research hypotheses facilitates selection
of the research design, the methodology to be used, the variables that
will be included, and the way in which the data will be analyzed. 
Moreover, it avoids confusion, loss of time, and unnecessary data
collection.
EXERCISE 1


      Malaria has been defined as a priority problem in Malarialand,*
and a group of investigators from the general health services of that
country have therefore decided to carry out a series of epidemiological
studies on the risk of malaria in the malarious areas of the country. 
Annex I presents general information about the country and its four
malarious areas. Using the information that you have at your disposal,
start your research with the following activities:


STEP  1:  Of the four malarious areas in Malarialand, select the one
that can be defined as having the highest priority.  Also identify,
within this area, the locality or localities in which research will
be initiated, specifying the criteria you applied or the reasoning
behind your selection of the particular region and locality or
localities.

STEP  2:  Formulate the general objectives of the epidemiological
research on the risk of malaria.

STEP  3:  State six hypotheses that the research will seek to prove
or disprove with a view to studying the role of six probable risk
factors that might account for the increased incidence of malaria in
the localities selected.

STEP  4:  Formulate a null hypothesis corresponding to each of the
six research hypotheses.

STEP  5:  Prepare a preliminary list of the information that you will
need to collect in order to prove the research hypotheses.








     4.4 Selection of the Research Design

      Like all scientific research, the epidemiological study of
malaria should be carried out on the basis of a structure, plan, or
design.  The research design makes it possible to structure the
theoretical frame of reference in accordance with the research
hypotheses.  Moreover, it facilitates selection of the number and type
of characteristics or factors to be studied and of the methods for
organizing, analyzing, and interpreting the data. 

      RESEARCH DESIGN

      The procedures and methods, predetermined by an
      investigator, to be adhered to in conducting a research
      project (Last:114).


      The selection and planning of the research design implies
identification of the variables or characteristics to be investigated
and definition of the procedures for selecting the groups that will be
studied, as well as the plan for randomization, if the design is
experimental.  As was pointed out in the Chapter 3, the most frequently
used epidemiological research designs are: 
(a) cross-sectional; (b) retrospective (case-control);
(c) prospective (cohort); and (d) controlled clinical trial.

      The research hypotheses and objectives must be taken into
account in selecting the research design.  In addition, it is necessary
to bear in mind existing limitations on information and resources. 
Finally, consideration should be given to whether or not a particular
research design will provide the structure needed in order to
adequately analyze the basic questions to be studied.

      4.5   Analysis of the Correlation between Malaria and the
Probable Risk Factors to be Studied

      4.5.1 Introduction

      After the research design has been selected, the next step is
to actually carry out the study.  Once all the epidemiological
information has been collected and sorted, it is broken down into the
corresponding contingency tables.  This is followed by calculation of
the basic measures for study and application of the statistical test
that has been selected for analysis of the study hypotheses. 

      The analysis and interpretation of epidemiological studies is
based on the results obtained in the tests of statistical significance. 
One of the most frequently used tests in epidemiology, and one that
exemplifies the use of contingency tables, is the chi-square test.

      4.5.2 Chi-Square Test

      In epidemiological research, one of the analytical strategies
for interpreting data is the use of a statistical test that makes it
possible to determine if there is a statistical association between the
presence of a disease--malaria, in this case--and the set of risk
factors postulated.

      The statistical association indicates the degree of probability
that an observed value, or a series of values, or the differences
between two values could have occurred by chance.

      STATISTICAL SIGNIFICANCE:

      Statistical methods allow an estimate to be made of the
      probability of the observed or greater degree of
      association between independent and dependent variables
      under the null hypothesis.  From this estimate, in a
      sample of given size, the statistical "significance" of
      a result can be stated.  Usually the level of statistical
      significance is stated by the P value (Last:124).
      
      Although there are many tests of statistical significance, the
selection of the one to be applied will depend to a large extent on
the type of research hypothesis formulated and the statistical
measurement that is desired.  In Section 4.3 it was pointed out that
all tests of statistical significance include null hypotheses.  The
development of null hypotheses is an indispensable requirement, since
statistical tests can be applied only with this type of hypothesis. 
As was mentioned previously, these hypotheses posit that there are no
differences in the population parameters (average, proportions, etc.)
between the two or more groups compared.  Statistical tests measure the
probability that the results obtained in a study could have occurred
by chance (see definition of P or probability value).  If it turns out
that there is very little probability that this could have happened,
the hypothesis of "no difference," or null hypothesis, can then be
rejected and the alternative hypothesis--i.e., the proposed research
hypothesis--accepted.


      Since the primary focus of the epidemiological research
discussed in these materials is malaria, and one of the research
hypotheses is that living in a dwelling that is not completely enclosed
is one of the probable social risk factors that increase the risk of
developing malaria, we must first establish the existence of a
statistical association between malaria and exposure to this risk
factor.  A frequently used test for determining this statistical
association is the chi-square test.

      CHI-SQUARE TEST
      Any statistical test based on comparison of a test
      statistic to a chi-square distribution.  The oldest and
      most common chi-square tests are for detecting whether
      two or more population distributions differ from one
      another; these tests usually involve counts of data, and
      may involve comparison of samples from the distributions
      under study, or the comparison of a sample to a
      theoretically expected distribution (Last:18).


      This test makes it possible to reject or not reject the null
hypothesis.  In other words, it makes it possible to establish the
association or lack of association between malaria and each of the
risk factors postulated.  It indicates the probability that the results
obtained could have occurred by chance.  This probability is stated as
the P or probability value.  This value expresses the probability that
the difference observed could have occurred purely by chance.  The P
value that is universally accepted as statistically significant is P
< 0.05.  However, this is an arbitrarily selected value and should be
considered merely a guide for interpreting the results.

      P VALUE:

      The letter P, followed by the abbreviation n.s (not significant)
      or the symbol < (less than) and a decimal notation such as 0.01,
      0.05, is a statement of the probability that the difference
      observed could have occurred by chance, if the groups are really
      alike (Last:94).


      Table 5 shows four cells, indicated by the letters a, b, c, and
d, which represent the number of individuals who possess both
characteristics at the same time.  Thus, for example, cell a expresses
the number of individuals who have the risk factor in question and who
also developed malaria (the health impairment that is being studied). 
Cells b, c, and d also express other important relationships.  The
formula for the chi-square test is as follows:

Sum of the
four cells  = (observed value -  expected value )2
expected value

Calculation of the expected value for each cell:
