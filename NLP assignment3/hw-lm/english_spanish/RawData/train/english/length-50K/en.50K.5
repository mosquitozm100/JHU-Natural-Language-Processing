d mention was made of the desirability of
incorporating the actions into the framework of primary care.  With this purpose in mind, it was
recommended that this should be carried out as a specific strategy.

     The strengthening of intersectoral relations was another approach underscored repeatedly by the
Group.  The desirability was emphasized of dynamically promoting both intersectoral incorporation of
the formal structures of administration related to the health, well-being, and education of children and
those of a nonofficial nature in the national area and at the level of the communities.

     Legal reforms oriented toward the protection and promotion of mental health of mothers and
children was another of the strategies pointed out during the meeting.  Among the changes discussed,
fundamental importance was given to the reforms required in labor legislation affecting women.

     Another strategy that was considered referred to the promotion of recreation programs
appropriately adapted to the needs of children and their families.






Several approaches through which the activities
making up the Regional Plan of Action could be carried
out were examined, and it was determined that the time-honored categories of promotion of mental
health and primary prevention, repair of damages or secondary prevention, and rehabilitation or tertiary
prevention were appropriate to the purposes of the Regional Program.

     The vastness of the field of action of these approaches confirms the need to establish priorities
both with regard to already selected fields of action and to the population groups for which preference
would be given to the use of available resources.

     From the perspective of the health sector, the setting in which its immediate actions will take
place is the area of the health services, which can play a double role with regard to the mental health
of children in acting as elements of health care per se and, paradoxically, as iatrogenic agents.

     The emotional equilibrium of mothers and children who are seeking health care is often
threatened by situations that arise in the health services.  Certain attitudes and behavior on the part of
the suppliers of the services and the general environment in many centers, where treatment is brusque
or the human rights of the patients are openly violated, sometimes succeed in producing emotional
imbalance. 



     




     The various mental health activities that make up the plans and programs should not be
developed monolithically in the manner of highly centralized vertical programs.  To the contrary, they
should be incorporated horizontally as elements of already existing child health programs, especially
as elements of maternal and child programs, and programs for the health of preschool and
schoolchildren.  At the same time a close relationship to the existing child care programs in other
sectors will be promoted, particularly with regard to education.

     Throughout the meeting several priority subjects considered to be of a priority nature were
discussed in the understanding that they do not exhaust the inventory of problems and conditions that
affect the mental health of children, although by virtue of their importance they deserve to be
considered among the foremost priorities.  They constitute points of departure that can serve as a basis
for the development of proposals for drafting the Plan of Action.

     The tentative nature of the proposals brings to light the general tone it is desired to imprint on
the Plan, whose preparation will not consist merely of the formulation of rigid canons but will rather
form part of a process of consultations, revisions, and reapproximations over the next two years.

     An abbreviated version of the presentations that served as a point of departure for the discussions
is contained in the annexes of the present report.  A summary is provided below of the most outstanding
points of the debate:


     Diagnosis of the Situation

     The information available in Latin America on the programs is insufficient to make an
approximate diagnosis, much less an accurate evaluation, of the situation of the mental health of
children, either with regard to the most important problems or to the services provided to care for them.

     The impression given by the specialized publications and general health reports is that at the
present time no specific programs exist for the mental health of children.  It may be affirmed with
relative certainty that national or provincial programs with defined structures and systematized actions
do not exist, although it is possible to identify actions and isolated programming elements in a very
small number of health services that could be considered to constitute mental health care.

     Thus, in several countries mental health considerations have been introduced into prenatal control
service, delivery care, and the management of high-risk deliveries.  In other countries infant stimulation
has been incorporated into maternal and child health programs.  Isolated mental health actions have also
have been carried out in programs for nutritional surveillance and family planning and in community
activities related to the extension of coverage of the general health services.  Evaluation of the maternal
and child health programs in the Hemisphere generally have to do with physical health care and, with
certain exceptions, do not emphasize the psychosocial aspects of maternal and child health.

     With regard to the most prevalent problems, some epidemiological research on mental health in
the general population in the 1960s included questions on the problems of children, and the results led
to the conclusion that a relatively high prevalence of mental retardation exists, both organic and
functional.  Subsequently, a few studies were carried out on the prevalence of epilepsy in the school
population that indicate surprisingly high rates, in some cases higher than 2% of the population studied. 
Child development studies have generally accentuated physical considerations.  Some studies have been
carried out on family dynamics, emphasizing the small amount of stimulation received by children in
the lower income strata and the consequent impairment of their social and cognitive development. 
More information is available in the education sector, especially with regard to school failure and
desertion, and to a lesser degree to learning and behavior problems.  However, generally speaking, the
health sector does not manage such information nor has it undertaken broad programs of cooperation
with the school system.


     Primary Prevention and Promotion

     Promotion of the mental health of children and primary prevention of psychosocial development
disorders, emotional imbalances, and mental disorders in children was dealt with throughout the
meeting and especially referred to in the working groups.  It was pointed out that the psychosocial
development of children does not end with adolescence, although there is evidence that the first six
years of life are critical to child development and that emphasis should consequently be given during
this period to actions to prevent imbalances and promote optimal development.

     The importance of global policies was underscored, particularly with reference to economic
policies and the consequences for the mental health of the family and children of the restrictions
imposed in most of the countries by the economic readjustment measures that have been carried out,
which have been largely the consequence of the external debt.  Note was taken of the importance of the
legal framework, which influences the daily lives of families and has a decisive effect on the mental
health of mothers and children.  Attention was also drawn to the need for analyzing the sociocultural
aspects involved, especially with regard to the practices followed in rearing children and to certain
attitudes and beliefs particularly prevalent in the Region.

     The existence of numerous prevention measures of proven effectiveness was repeatedly
mentioned, although it was considered desirable to weigh the cost/benefit ratio of each, both in
proposing them and in evaluating them.  

     Among the interventions considered, great importance was assigned to those capable of being
incorporated into programs for family planning, prenatal care, immunization, disaster preparedness,
prevention of malnutrition, and accident prevention.

     Some aspects of general health care that take place outside the health facilities can incorporate
effective prevention and promotion actions at low cost with proven effectiveness, as, for example, house
calls and of school health programs.


Role of the Family

     The family as a determining factor in the mental health of children was an important item on the
agenda; it was also considered repeatedly in discussing other subjects during the meeting.

     The subject of the dissolution of marriages and its social and economic consequences-
-which are mostly negative for mothers and children--was examined in detail, and the promotion of
legal protection measures was suggested.  The Group also formulated other recommendations to prevent
harm, including the identification of couples at risk, the training of health workers to carry out concrete
interventions, the development of educational programs, and, as in other aspects of the Plan, the
adoption of legislative measures.

     The effects of dysfunctional couples and the adverse consequences on children of abandonment
of the home by one of the parents were debated widely.  The provision of psychological counseling and
care services for couples with problems was another one of the recommendations formulated.

     Physical and psychological abuse of mothers and children was analyzed with respect to its effects
on the mental health of the victims and the need for providing specific assistance and for promoting
protection and rehabilitation measures. 

     The role of mothers is customarily underscored as the key element in promoting the psychosocial
development of children, thereby ignoring the role performed by fathers in this process.  It has been
suggested, accordingly, that the programs consider both partners of the couple in educational initiatives
oriented to promotion and prevention as well as in direct care when it is indicated.

     Among the measures for the promotion of mental health and primary prevention based on family
life are the sharing of tasks between the spouses, house-call services, and the granting of paid leave
from work for both parents on the occasion of births and adoptions in the family.

     It should be pointed out that the activities prescribed in this field precede birth and continue
beyond adolescence; consequently, they should be initiated before conception and even before
formation of the couple.


     Role of the School

     The school plays a determining role in the psychosocial development of children.  Unfortunately,
the conditions prevalent in the school system in most of Latin America are not propitious to optimal
development.

     The training of teachers is almost always a cause of controversy, and studies are generally
lacking on what the most appropriate training should be in view of the heterogeneous situations of the
countries.  As a rule, teachers do not receive any training or field experience with regard to the mental
health of children.

     Teachers not only are poorly trained but in practice are forced to develop curricula within a short
period of time, teach a large number of classes, and be subjected to numerous administrative controls. 
The parents, whose opinion as a rule is not required by the school system, cannot make their voices
heard with regard to the educational process, and still less are they able to intervene actively and
contribute along with the educators in processes that are not strictly academic, such as in the promotion
of mental health.

     A high proportion of the children who begin primary education do not finish it, and the number
of school desertions before the third grade is high.  A substantial portion of the population therefore
remains in a state of semi- or total illiteracy.  Under such conditions adequate psychosocial development
is threatened, and a socially and economically disadvantageous situation is created for the future of the
child.  School desertion is associated with patent risks for mental health, as is demonstrated by the high
proportion of school dropouts revealed by surveys carried out on inhalers of solvents, prostitutes,
common delinquents, and the perpetrators of violent acts.

     An appreciable portion of the school population in the Region, which in some cases may reach
as much as 10%, demonstrate learning problems.  However, the educational system does not have
facilities for evaluating these children nor does it provide services for assisting them.  It was
recommended that these deficiencies be remedied, and that in the case of children with learning
problems, that their cultural particularities, their native languages, and their home conditions be taken
into account when they are evaluated in order to ensure that cultural deterioration is not interpreted as
a lack of intelligence. 

     In general, the schools do not possess the equipment and facilities necessary for the promotion
of academic development, such as libraries, data processing, and periodicals. 

     Despite the apparent cultural uniformity of Latin America, the product of Spanish and Portuguese
colonization, the Region is home to a multitude of cultural groups, scattered in a mosaic of communities
that use different languages, are in various stages of development, and have disparate degrees of
technological development.  A particular case is that of the indigenous peoples, many of them
monolingual, for whom the school systems, with certain exceptions, do not provide.  But other
marginalized groups also exist who are not necessarily indigenous and who also live in a state of
abandonment or neglect. 

     The conditions outlined above produce great educational differences, both at the hemispheric
level and within the countries.  Only in exceptional cases have experiments been carried out in which
the modalities of the educational system have been adapted to the characteristics of the various
population groups.  In general it may be said that the Latin American educational system is undergoing
a crisis, determined in part by the economic situation.  There is a predominant trend toward the
decentralization and privatization of teaching that has resulted in progressive abandonment by the State
of its responsibility in the field of education.



     Communications Media

     The influence of the mass communications media on the mental health and psychosocial
development of children is a matter of great concern.  Although these media could be utilized as
instruments to promote and develop mental health, the use that is being made of them at the present
time has, on the whole, produced negative effects.  Of particular interest is the influence of television,
whose effects on the behavior of children and the thought patterns it conveys were strongly underscored
during the meeting. 

     The contents of television programs, in which violence, the consumption of mind-altering
substances, and promiscuous sexual behavior predominate, not to mention the constant encouragement
of consumerism and the introduction of cultural distortions, cannot fail to leave an impression on the
minds of children who are exposed daily, in many cases for hours at a time, to the messages of this
communications medium.  Children can and in fact often do imitate the violence and sexual behavior
shown in television programs and thus generally become familiarized with the lifestyles represented.

     On the other hand, it must not be forgotten that television is a socializing factor which, although
competing with family life and with school activities, can also provide an effective environment for
education and for the promotion of mental health.  In order to achieve this end it is necessary to
undertake the single-minded task of educating and negotiating with the television industry, whose
leaders on many occasions have shown their willingness to cooperate.


     Health Services

     As already pointed out, the mental health services for children in the Region are limited or
nonexistent.  In the few instances in which resources have been allocated for the care of children they
are almost always used to provide direct services to individuals and only in exceptional cases are aimed
at particular population segments. 

     The care pyramid in the field of mental health is inverted:  its broad base corresponds to highly
specialized tertiary care that essentially serves the adult population and consumes most of the resources. 
The intermediate portion of the pyramid corresponds to psychiatric services in general hospitals and
mental health units of limited quantity and coverage in the health centers.  The vertex corresponds to
a few feeble endeavors to provide community services and some very limited attempts to provide care
at the primary level.

     Some specialists are inclined to favor the development of vertical and centralized programs,
which perpetuate the situation described above.  In the opinion of the Group, it would be wiser to
promote the creation of horizontal programs centered on the community and incorporated into the
traditional health programs that serve the communities.

     In this connection, mental health actions can gradually be integrated into the health teams at the
primary and secondary care levels and carried out by nonspecialized health workers.  The function of
the specialist will be to provide continuing education for these workers and to provide advisory services
for the identification and management of problems.  Disorders such as enuresis, hyperactivity, and
convulsive attacks are demonstrative examples of problems that can be solved at the primary and
secondary levels.  Situations will arrive, of course, that surpass the capabilities developed in the health
workers at those levels.  As a result, it will be necessary to establish effective mechanisms for the
referral of patients to specialists and for feedback to the originating entity. 

     Of great importance in this system, which attempts to strengthen the services in the communities,
is the promotion of social support networks.  These are, in fact, the first point of contact between the
population and the health services and education systems.  By promoting them and providing them with
technical support, the services will be able to establish an early warning system to monitor and solve
some of the population's psychosocial problems, in addition to providing care when it is needed. 

     There are numerous examples of maternal and child mental health activities that may be carried
out in the general health care facilities.  For example, prenatal care provides a unique opportunity for
promoting the establishment of early ties between mothers and children; the training of hospital
personnel and workers in health centers can assist in reducing the traumatic effects these institutions
may have on mothers and children; and the family planning clinics can develop activities relating to
family counseling, management of the home economy, analysis of problems, and the improvement of
family communication.

     In general, the relationship of patients and family members with the health care providers can
provide an exceptional opportunity to strengthen the roles of individuals, foster contact with reality, and
promote communication--all of which are elements of great value in the promotion of mental health. 
In order to achieve these relationships, the training of health professionals must be restructured, both
at the academic level and in the services.  Such changes are necessary not only with regard to general
health personnel but also to specialists.


     Research

     Research is a fundamental strategy for the development of services to promote the mental health
of children.  Each country must determine the areas in which special importance will be given to
research and appropriate priorities will be established.  In any case, there was consensus regarding the
desirability of promoting applied research that will be focused on the solution of the most urgent
problems in every country.

     An area of research that is of common interest to all the countries is epidemiological research
on population groups, either of the limited, cross-sectional type or of the longitudinal type.  It was
noted, however, that the latter, in spite of its evident merits, is problematic by virtue of the absence of
a service structure that facilitates data collection and processing over a period of several years and of
the varied and costly resources that would be required to supplant this absence. 


     There was agreement on the need to systematize, register, and disseminate information on
various aspects of the mental health of children.  As the programs are expanded, monitoring of the
population strengthened, and the activities evaluated, exchanges in this area will become more feasible.

     The capacity of the countries to carry out research on the mental health of children is limited by
the lack of human resources, technical capability, and material inputs.  In this regard, the appropriate
international organizations should act as mediators for obtaining material and technical assistance.

     The recommendation was reiterated of carrying out epidemiological research, both operational
and on specific aspects of collective mental health.  The specific subjects for research will vary from
country to country.  A few are mentioned below by way of example:

     -    epidemiological studies of divorce;

     -    landmarks in psychosocial development;

     -    adolescent pregnancy;

     -    birth control practices used by young people;

     -    functionality of low-income urban and rural families;

     -    attenuating risk factors for mental health;

     -    self-care arrangements; and

     -    social support networks and their function in the promotion of the mental health of
children.


     Personnel Training 

     Mention was made of the relative shortage and uneven distribution of personnel specialized in
the mental health of children.  There was also mention of the relative lack of expertise in this field on
the part of unspecialized health personnel and also of pediatricians, family physicians, and internists. 
The lack of training of educators in this field as a whole was also stressed. 

     Manpower development in the field of the mental health of children should include the
participation of the academic environment, in-service education, continuing education, and community
extension programs.  A very important element is the training of primary care personnel by virtue of
the fact that they are the first to establish contact with the community.  It is appropriate to point out that
personnel training cannot follow a uniform pattern in all the countries and that it should be geared to
the particular problems of the population, the availability of resources, and their distribution and
utilization.

     Formal training, conceived in this way, should be supplemented with a system for the
dissemination of information--whether technical or administrative or for the information and education
of the public--and special emphasis should be placed on keeping the decision-making levels duly
informed.








     The text of the present report contains numerous recommendations, some of them implicit, the
majority expressed clearly.  However, at the end of the meeting the working groups formulated the
following additional recommendations: 

     1.   The Plan of Action should take full account of the existence of highly vulnerable
population groups in which risk factors are concentrated.  Such is the case of the victims
of poverty and marginalization, the children of disappeared persons, and refugees, among
others.  As a result, when policies are proposed, specific measures for the protection of
these groups should be indicated. 

2.    A priority that was made evident for the Group and whose specific
      consideration is recommended was aid for the children of refugees and
      disappeared persons, and for abandoned children, who at the present time
      constitute a particularly severe problem for the Region.
     3.   Policies should also be oriented toward the protection of rural and
indigenous populations, who, in addition to suffering the ordeals of poverty
and abandonment, are forced by political, economic, and unlawful interests
to carry out actions that in the final analysis prove to be self-damaging. 

     4.   The Plan of Action should be structured from an epidemiological perspective
that makes it possible to identify priority problems at both the regional and
local levels.  Special emphasis should be placed on participation in this task
by representatives of the various sectors involved, particularly education and
health.

     5.   The mental health problems of children should be dealt with through the use
of comprehensive criteria that consider them in the framework of their
relationship with the environment.  In using this approach, special
importance should be assigned to the prevention of potentially dysfunctional
relations, such as child/family, child/school, and child/community, and the
linkages between peers and with adults should be taken into consideration.

     6.   Steps should be taken to ensure the continuity of child health care from birth
through adolescence.  This continuity should be facilitated in the
administration of mental health services and in the transition within the
school system from preschool education through primary school, secondary
school, and university levels. 

7.    Although the study and correction of the most frequent pathologies and
      adverse situations that affect children should be included in the Plan and in
      the programs deriving from it, no less importance should be given to study
      of the potentials of children who have not been exposed to imbalances and
      who have been able to successfully overcome unfavorable conditions. 
      Adoption of this approach is crucial for the development of promotion and
      prevention programs.
     8.   The Plan should strengthen the regional networks for the exchange of
information on the mental health of children and facilitate the fluid
management and transmission of statistical, clinical, and technological
information.

     9.   Among the lines of program action recommended for consideration are:

-    deficits of development;

-    promotion of the establishment of early ties and study of the factors
that affect them;

-    specific programs for children at high risk (undernourished and
abandoned children, refugees, children of disappeared parents, etc.);

-    the influence of violence on child development and prevention and
care measures, with special emphasis on care for children who are the
victims of aggression.

     10.  The need was emphasized to strengthen research by all available means and
to promote technical cooperation among the countries.  Specific
recommendations were made to: 

-    identify problems of common interest and, if possible, to undertake
research in which several countries participate through the use of a
common protocol;

-    assign priority to epidemiological studies;

-    support action-oriented research or research that will lead to useful
interventions in order to reduce damages;

-    create or adapt appropriate screening instruments for the detection of
risks.

     11.  The recommendation was reiterated of promoting the training of human
resources in the mental health of children in view of the need to: 

-    introduce or strengthen, as required, subject areas concerning the
mental health of children in the curricula of the various health
professions and in other university or technical programs containing
a social component that affects the lives of children;

-    include the subject in programs for continuing education and in-
service education, and for programs for the training of primary health
care personnel.

     12.  A specific recommendation was made to PAHO to convene a meeting of a
group of experts on children who are the victims of aggression. 

     13.  It was recommended to include specifically in the Plan of Action the
bioethical aspects of care and research as they pertain to the mental health
of children. 

14.   PAHO was urged to transmit the present report and the working material for
      the meeting to the World Committee on the Child and to the meeting
      summits that have been programmed.

      EXTERNAL EVALUATION OF THE ADMINISTRATION AND 
     ORGANIZATION OF THE PERUVIAN PRIMATOLOGY PROJECT



CONSULTANT:  Dr. Otoniel Velasco F.

REFERENCE:  Contractual Services Agreement No. 92/P-024-ASC



METHODOLOGY


Information on the Project was obtained from Dr. Sato in Lima,
after review of the annual reports for the period from 1985 to
1990.  A field trip was made to Iquitos (from 26 to 28 March)
where extensive interviews with the professional personnel of
the Project were conducted and the animal reproduction
installations in Iquitos and the stations on Padre Island and
Muyuy Island were visited.  The Strategy and Plan of Action of
the Project for the period from 1985 to 1990 were reviewed, as
well as the draft of the report for 1991.


ANALYSIS


1. In the middle of the 1980s the consultant visited the
Project, making it possible to present an opinion on the changes
observed between 1984 and 1992:

a)   With regard to reproduction in captivity, the colonies have
been stabilized; the pathological problems have been reduced
significantly; and the diet utilized has minimized the
importation of supplies from outside the region.

b)   With respect to reproduction in the wild under control of
the above-mentioned stations on the islands, there has been
significant progress in determining the behavior and habits of
the primates and field specimens brought from other areas and
maintained in captivity adapted well to the natural conditions
upon being set free in the forest.

c)   The Project has promoted the seeding of native forest
species that produce fruits and flowers utilized by the primates
in their feeding and ensure ecological equilibrium.

d)   In addition, a very interesting relationship has been
achieved with the small communities on the islands, which the
Project provides with direct and, most particularly, indirect
support, facilitating the provision of agricultural,
educational, and health services by the state organizations of
the country.


2.   As is known, the Project originated in 1975 in an agreement
signed by PAHO and the Government of Peru, represented by the
Ministries of Agriculture, Foreign Affairs, and Health.  The
corresponding letter of agreement has been amended and expanded
four times, the last time in 1992, when its life was extended
to 1995.


3.   It should be noted that the letter of agreement was signed
at a time when the decentralization of the Peruvian state
apparatus had not yet begun.  In the 16 years that have passed
since then, the Peruvian Amazon Research Institute (IIAP) has
been created for the study and protection of the natural
resources of the national Amazon region with relatively
significant financial resources, in particular, those
corresponding to a percentage of the petroleum royalties.  In
addition, in more recent years a vigorous process of
decentralization directed toward the constitution of regional
governments has been initiated.  This process, although it is
questioned by some political forces, is irreversible and
responds to a long-standing yearning in the provinces, which
complain of the excessive centralization in the capital of the
republic.


4.   Although the amendments to the original agreement have
facilitated the participation of the IIAP and the regional
government of Amazonas, this participation is relatively
marginal.  The IIAP has a nominal presence in the governing
bodies and there is potential duplication of functions; with
respect to the regional governments, there are no mechanisms
that permit the participation of the governments of the other
regions in those in which the Project has jurisdiction.


5.   The Project operates as an agreement among the following
parties:  the Ministry of Agriculture, San Marcos University,
the Ministry of Health, the IIAP, and PAHO.  The parties
contribute in various ways; thus:

a)   The Ministry of Agriculture, through the Office of Forestry
and Fauna (DGFF), provides the political and legal framework
inasmuch as the protection of the wild fauna and its enforcement
is within its purview.  According to the letter of agreement the
Project should be administered by the DGFF, but that
organization has formalized an agreement with the Veterinary
Institute for Tropical and Highland Research (IVITA), which is
the administrative entity.

b)   The San Marcos National University contributes facilities
and personnel through IVITA.

c)   The Ministry of Health does not contribute resources but
develops a secondary activity.

d)   The IIAP contributes neither human nor financial resources.

e)   PAHO has a staff consultant at the Project headquarters,
finances temporary consultants, and arranges for the transfer
of primates requested by research laboratories in the United
States of America or third countries.  Until recently PAHO
administered the funds from those transfers but by a recent
agreement these resources are transferred to the Project, which
is charged with their administration.


6.   The financing of the Project comes from several sources:

a)   National sources:

-    IVITA, which finances the wages of twenty-three persons: 
     eight professionals (three veterinarians and five
     biologists) and 15 aides (office and field).
-    Ministry of Agriculture (Loreto Regional Office), which
     finances one professional half time.

b)   External sources:

-    Contributions from PAHO with extrabudgetary regional funds.
-    Income from the transfers of primates.


7.   The Project does not maintain an integrated accounting
system because of the nature of the financing scheme, so that:

a)   It is not possible to establish the total amount of the
budget and analyze the existing relationship among approved
budgets, budgets expended, and the structures of the financing
and of the corresponding expenditure.

b)   According to the information collected, the incomes from
transfer of primates are as follows:

Years               1985 1986 1987 1988 1989 1990 1991
($US thousands)     86.7 l94.2241.6374.8...  214.7249.5

These funds are used to contract auxiliary personnel (32
positions), to augment the wages of the national personnel, and
to cover the operating costs of the Project, including the
feeding of the colonies, fuel and lubricant purchases,
maintenance of the physical infrastructure, and expenditures for
trips into the forest.  When there is money left over, it is
applied to the acquisition of equipment.

c)   On the basis of partial information it has been possible to
establish the following table of expenditures with the funds
from transfers of primates:

 
(In $US thousands)              1990      1991        1992*

- Salaries and wages            66.4      52.4         52.4
- Allowances                    23.5      23.2         32.6

_______   _______       _______
2l4.7     249.5         l50.0

* Budgeted.


In light of this situation it is foreseen that in l992 serious
difficulties will arise for the functioning of the Project.


8.   In regard to the organization, it is responding to a
solution involving a compromise between the parties and with
slight modifications the same scheme described in the Regulation
of the Organization and Functions in effect has been maintained.


9.   The organization has three levels:  the Advisory Council,
the Directorate, and the advisory, support, and line units.

a)   Advisory Council:  It has its headquarters in the city of
Lima.  Presiding over it is the Director-General of Forest and
Fauna and its members include a representative of IVITA, a
representative of the Ministry of Health, a representative of
the IIAP, a representative of PAHO, and the Director of the XXII
Departmental Agrarian Unit in Loreto in his role as Chairman of
the Directorate.  The Council is the highest level decision-
making body of the Project; it sets the general policy, approves
the budgets and plans, accepts donations, approves the
Regulation of the Organization and Functions of the Project,
arranges legal matters, and secures relationships with other
national or foreign institutions.  In sum, despite its name it
is actually constituted as the Directorate of the Project.

b)   The Directorate has its headquarters in Iquitos.  Presiding
over it is the Director of Natural Resources and the Environment
of the Region of Loreto and it is composed of the Technical
Coordinator of IVITA in Iquitos, the Chairman of the IIAP, the
Departmental Director of Health, and the PAHO Adviser in
Iquitos.  The Directorate is the permanent directing body,
responsible for the operation of the Project and the fulfillment
of the agreements emanating from the Advisory Council.  What is
called the Directorate is actually the Executive Committee of
the Project.

c)   In regard to the advisory units, the Regulation mentions
the Legal Counsel and the Office of Planning and Budget.  But
neither of these was found to be functioning due to a deficiency
of financial resources.

d)   The Office of Administration is the support unit of the
Project; it is charged with the administration of the material,
human, and financial resources.  It is under a Director who
reports to the Directorate.

e)   In regard to the line units, a Bureau of Research and
Management has been established.  It is responsible for carrying
out, coordinating, controlling, and evaluating the activities
in the areas of research and technical assistance and is headed
by a Director who also reports directly to the Directorate. 
This Bureau includes two departments:  Reproduction in Captivity
and Natural Areas.


EVALUATION


1.   The organization described above is understood to be the
result of a transaction among the various integral parts of the
Project which has required the Project to function in practice
with ad hoc solutions in order to ensure that it operated at
least minimally as a unit.  Thus, for several years the
Coordinator of the IVITA in Iquitos was simultaneously the
Director of Administration of the Project, performing in
practice the functions that would correspond to an executive
director.  This solution, although it resolves some concrete
problems, is not basic and introduces an element of instability
in the Project that is expressed in the absence of what we could
call consolidated formulation of policies and plans.


2.   Indeed, when the plans are reviewed it is observed that
these are an aggregate of initiatives by the biologists and the
veterinarians that work in the Project.  Each group attempts to
dominate the Project, creating a hegemony that is translated
into a claim for a greater allocation of resources for
activities that, although they are complementary in the long
term, are competitive in the short term.  The biologists only
pay attention to the field work, that is, to the capture of
primates and to research on their habits in the natural forest,
while the veterinarians devote themselves almost exclusively to
reproduction in captivity and related problems.  Since there is
no executive director, that is, no full-time staff member on the
Project who is responsible for its daily conduct in all its
aspects, there is no discussion of the various initiatives and
no search for consensus; hence, at the meetings of the
Directorate, each group applies pressure so that resources are
assigned to it.


3.   In addition, the presence of the IIAP in the Project is
very important but, according to the information collected, the
Project does not utilize the potential resources of that
organization.  For example, it does not appear reasonable to
have the Chairman of the Directorate of the Project be a staff
member of the Loreto Region which does not have jurisdiction in
the area of the Project.  It would seem to be more desirable to
have the Directorate presided over by the Chairman of the IIAP,
an institution that has jurisdiction in the entire area of the
Project (except the Department of Tumbes) and that, as a center
for research on problems of the Amazon region, is vitally
interested in the business of the Project, which handles matters
related to the protection of primates and wild fauna in general.


4.   In reference to budgetary matters, the Project should
define some expenditures as fixed and others as variable.

a)   Among the fixed expenditures are those for the regular
staff for the operation of the animal reproduction unit and the
field stations.  In total, there are 55 persons working on the
Project full-time and one, half time; of these, eight are
professionals and 47 are aides; this last number appears to be
excessive and there is no rational explanation that justifies
it.  Expenditures for feeding the primates in captivity and a
minimum amount for the maintenance of the installations are also
fixed expenses.  The costs of expeditions to the field which,
according to a consensus of the professionals in the Project,
should include a minimum of one trip a year for each of the
species managed by the Project (six), are also fixed
expenditures.


b)   Among the variable expenditures should be the resources
necessary for expeditions to collecting primates to fill
specific orders.



RECOMMENDATIONS


1.   In regard to the organization:

a)   There should be a review of the role assigned to the
Advisory Council, which, as we have pointed out, actually
performs the functions that correspond to a directorate; it
should be limited to providing advice and support for
negotiations for the Project in Lima.  This presupposes that
what is now known as the Directorate ought to assume most of the
functions of the Advisory Council and delegate to the Executive
Director of the Project most of the functions that currently are
assigned to it.

b)   The Project should have an Executive Director responsible
for the administrative and technical aspects and the pertinent
offices for advisory, support, and line functions should be
under his direction.  The Executive Director should be the only
staff member reporting directly to the Directorate and his
appointment should be made by consensus.  The profile of the
Executive Director should be characterized by abilities in
management and project administration and by academic training
in veterinary sciences and primatology.


2.   The basic agreement signed in l975, which has been being
renewed only formally, should be reviewed in depth.  In the
almost l6 years that have passed, not only has the national
scene been modified, in terms of strong currents of
decentralization as we have pointed out, but also the
international setting has changed, with high priority being
given to the protection of nature, expressed in what is called
the "green wave."  It should be recalled that the Project was
born with the priority of rationalizing the provision of
primates for biomedical experimentation.  Currently, priority
appears to be assigned to the protection of the primate species
as a substantial part of the protection of the natural resources
of the Amazon region and to the utilization of primates bred in
captivity for biomedical experimentation.  These changes in
emphasis can be processed so that the international effort
contributes to their strengthening.  For these reasons the
preparation of a new agreement appears to be appropriate.


3.   Given the precariousness of the national institutions it is
difficult for a project such as this one to be sustained over
a sufficiently prolonged period to achieve self-financing and
be transformed into a center for innovation and technological
development, if it does not have substantive international
support.  In this respect international collaboration is basic
and given that PAHO has carried out pioneer work in this field
it appears desirable that the Project be transformed into an
International Center for Primatology under the auspices of PAHO
which could call on other international entities directly
involved in the defense of nature and other sources of
financing.  The international collaboration can be designed so
that it constitutes 50% of the financing of the center, with the
other 50% financed by national sources.  Among the national
sources it is very important to involve the IIAP for the reasons
previously cited and also IVITA, which already has resources and
experience in this field.


4.   With respect to the budgetary aspects:

a)   It is important to introduce a rationale to the current
expenditures, in particular in regard to auxiliary personnel. 
Apart from continued exploration of the possibilities of
reducing the costs of feeding the primates by increased use of
local supplies, there should be a review of the desirability of
continuing to maintain a significant stock of some species whose
second and third generations have been born in captivity and the
demand for which has been drastically reduced.  The cost of
maintaining these animals constitutes a significant drain on the
finances of the Project and alternatives, such as the donation
of specimens to animal reproduction units or to various
institutions for pets, should be studied.  It is also necessary
to study an alternative destination for some individuals of
endangered species that are kept in the Iquitos reproduction
unit by order of the DGFF.  The costs of maintaining these
individuals fall on the Project and it would not be difficult
to have them transferred to some national zoo.

b)   The fixed costs should be identified precisely so that
their financing is assured.

c)   With regard to the variable expenditures, it appears to us
desirable that the office in Washington, on accepting an order
for primates, request an advance of 50% of the agreed-upon
price, in order to finance the costs of the collecting
expeditions.

d)   The accounting should be unified in such a way that the
Project has timely information on the structure of the financing
and the expenditures.  On the basis of realistic analyses,
medium-term projections could be made to be used in preparing
strategies for financing.


5.   The Project has used as its framework for planning the
Strategy and Plan of Action for l985-l990.  Although it has not
been possible to do a thorough evaluation, broadly speaking it
is perceived that the degree of execution has been relatively
satisfactory.  But we are already in l992 and there is no
framework of planning for the medium term.  It is therefore
desirable that in the very n
