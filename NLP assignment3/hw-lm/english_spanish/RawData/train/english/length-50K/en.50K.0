The meeting at Quebec called "International Health:  A Field
of Professional Study and Practice" made clear the pertinence of
a meeting whose subject was an analysis of the status of thinking
in the field of international health.

As the sessions revealed, that pertinence was emphasized
from three viewpoints.  The first was represented by those
participants who held that the meeting could create a landmark by
helping advance from the old to the new international health,
from the colonial or neocolonial idea which has reigned until now
to an independent-cooperative model.  The second viewpoint was
represented by those who thought that beyond a break, the meeting
established the status of the question in the field and to what
point it had advanced, and who were concerned about the impact it
might have on formulating new approaches to the subject. 
Finally, some participants stressed the relationship between
public health and international health, and noted that the
meeting disclosed certain limitations on explanations provided
exclusively by the health sector.

With the idea of recovering some of the central points in
the discussion, some of the items of collective reflection are
dealt with quite schematically in this section (Part I), while
aspects that are considered central to defining a field of study
and practice are taken up later (Part II).  Finally, a few
proposals for developing the field of international health as to
the production of information and training of human resources are
enumerated (Part III).


I.          Recapitulation:  Toward the construction of an alternative
to the classic international health approach

On the basis of the discussions which took place during the
meeting, it is possible to identify the existence of at least
three approaches to the question of international health
according to the boundaries of their subjects of study.  Indeed,
this is the aspect dealt with most extensively during the
discussions.

International health approached from the viewpoint of
delimiting its subject matter obviously does not exhaust all the
aspects which various authors have taken into consideration in
defining the field.  The approaches which are implicit in an
equal number of meanings of the idea of international health,
using different variables, have been the subject of a survey
which is set out in one of the studies published here.  Such
approaches involve other ways of defining priorities, theoretical
frameworks, and areas of application.1

The first of the three approaches identified during the
meeting, which might be called the "classical approach,"
construes its subject of study and intervention as health in the
underdeveloped countries and, in some instances, adds minorities
and marginal groups in the central countries to this
delimitation.  This approach basically occurs in most of the
international health programs offered by schools of public health
in the United States.

The second approach tries to go beyond the classical
approach by highlighting the need to construct a "new
international health" whose subject would not be defined by
delimitation based on the level of development achieved by
countries but by recognition that there are national and
international arenas.  International health would be the
correlate of public health on the plane of the ... "phenomena,
links, actions, and interactions in the health-disease process
which occur between the subjects and the spheres of international
society."2

Finally, the third approach joins the international
dimensions of health with health as an international matter.  It
is differentiated from the first in that it does not limit its
subject to the underdeveloped countries; on the contrary, it
characterizes a view of that kind as ethnocentric.  And it is
differentiated from the second by not giving priority to the
national-international relationship in its delimitation but
rather to the structure, processes, and relationships of world
power which in turn and to a different extent and in different
ways affect the configuration of the health-disease process and
the care systems within each national unit.

1.          The classical approach

The discussions during the meeting of concern to us revealed
the structural features of the model underlying the classical
approach to international health.  There was basic agreement as
to the characteristics of those features.

The features in question refer to both the definition of the
subject of study and the practices stemming from it.

In trying to present the characteristics of the classic
model schematically, as discussed during the meeting, the
ideological nature of the definition of the subject of study
which, based on an ethnocentric concept, defines the subject of
international health in relation to the "others" is seen.  This
definition of the "other" involves an attempt to understand what
is different by focusing on an implicit "we."  The "other" may be
peripheral countries or minorities in the central countries. 
Public health is limited to explaining and intervening in the
health question of the central countries, sometimes by excluding
minorities.  On the basis of this concept, the subject of public
health is thus defined on the basis of this implicit "we," while
that of international health is constructed in relation to the
cultural or economic "other."

This definition is not based on a relational analysis, i.e.,
on an approach that explains the emergence of a state of
development (for example, technologic underdevelopment) through
observation of those general processes which produce states of
technologic overdevelopment on the one hand, associated with
situations of technologic underdevelopment on the other.

Indeed, in this approach each category (underdeveloped
countries or minorities) appears as a total system, to explain
which it is only necessary to refer to the internal functions and
relationships of the system.

In this way, the asymmetry of power which occurs on a global
scale is hidden, and thus the fact that this may to a large
extent explain the conditions under which the countries on the
periphery are evolving.

In the same way, the fact that the asymmetrical
relationships of the different social groups within a national
unit is often omitted, which may explain the structures and
processes on which the subordinate social groups in the central
countries are articulated.

As discussed during the meeting, one of the consequences of
this definition is that the subject of study is made uniform. 
The peripheral countries appear to be subjects of uniform
actions.  The classic approach has in many cases operated on the
assumption that such countries are homogeneous among and within
themselves.

The foregoing has been expressed in the activities carried
out on the basis of this viewpoint in homogeneous and
decontextualized responses imposed on heterogeneous realities,
both from the cultural and economic viewpoints, of the peripheral
countries.

At the same time, the care concept was noted among others
which is implicit in the classic approach and which determines
the set of activities that are undertaken on the basis of this
viewpoint and that reduces a counterpart to an uncritical
internalizer of models and technologies whose priority and
pertinence was decided extranationally and from a unilateral
perspective.  Likewise, the importance of the prevalence of this
care concept in the treatment provided to social groups defined
as minorities became clear.

This care concept has impeded the execution of activities
aimed at strengthening the scientific and technologic capacity of
technologically underdeveloped countries.


2.          Some categories that could shape an alternative view of
international health

Points of agreement in relation to the critique of the
classic approach were not the only matters presented during the
meeting.  Certain categories could also be identified which were
pointed out by participants supporting different approaches which
could shape an alternative view in the subject of international
health.

In other words, there was a consensus on two points:  first,
on the recognition of the limitations of the so-called classic
approaches, and second, the need to construct new approaches in a
process already initiated by various groups in the Region.

The characteristics proposed for working out this new
approach include the aspects of delimiting the subject of study
from adequate theoretical and methodologic frameworks as well as
those aspects dealing with the mechanisms on the basis of which
the principles of international health can be implemented.

The need was pointed out for constructing independent
approaches which do not uncritically reproduce the dominant
concept of international health in the developed countries.  This
construction should include the contributions of investigators in
such countries who share the need to achieve a cooperative
approach.

The importance of not establishing a false dichotomy between
the northern and southern positions was stressed, but rather of
making an effort to develop, in view of the scant reflection in
this field in Latin America, an alternative of Latin American
thought as well as self-reflection for the set of actors involved
in matters of international health in the developed world.

With respect to delimiting the subject of study, it was
understood that international health should not be limited to the
field of the underdeveloped countries.  It was noted that there
are common themes in the regional health question which warrant
common reflection, basically at the level of the powerful spurs
which influence the health systems in most of the countries above
and beyond the north-south relationship and which are
crystallized in problems of financing the system; of asymmetry in
the relationships between the different professional categories
working in the sector; of the limitations of the proposals which
are predicated on volunteers, from whom it is expected that they
will make up for the inadequacies of the system; the introduction
of indiscriminate technologies; attempts to solve through
biomedical criteria the social problems arising from
socioeconomic determinants, environmental risks, and the
atomization of the health system.

As was emphasized in the meeting, the field of international
health requires an interdisciplinary approach.  This involves the
concurrence of both those disciplines which focus the analysis on
the international arena and the contribution of public health and
the social sciences.

At the same time, the intersectoral nature of the problems
of international health was noted for dealing with which both the
sectors directly linked to health care and those related to their
conditioners and determinants should take part.

Considered central in constructing an alternative approach
was the historical, national, and regional contextualization of
the activities established in order to preclude standardizing
normative actions by the countries, with a lack of information
about national processes.  Such contextualization would be based
on recognition of the cultural and economic heterogeneity among
and in each of the countries.

The essential objective of international cooperation in
health adjusted to this new approach would be to strengthen the
self-capacity of the countries intervening in the process of
cooperation in a conception according to which international
health activities would be used as an instrument of diplomacy and
solidarity and not as a mechanism of domination.

In turn, stress was put on the need to strengthen technical
cooperation among countries, which means a process of interaction
which is not unidirectional in nature and which is conducted not
only in the way in which it has been classically, i.e., from the
technologically developed countries toward the underdeveloped
ones.  In fact, the need was also considered of stimulating
cooperation between developing countries, between developed
countries, and from the former toward the latter, highlighting
the subjects of financing, organization, and development of
medical care services, human resources development, social
participation in health, and the environment.


3.          Two approaches to drawing up alternative models in
international health

Basically, two proposals were put forward during the meeting
to deal with the field of international health in order to
overcome the limitations of the classical approaches.  The first
is known as "new international health,"2 in contrast to that
called "traditional international health."  The second refers to
two dimensions of analysis:  on the one hand are the questions
which, from the international sphere, unduly influence the
health-disease process and the health care systems obtaining at
the national level (international dimensions of health); on the
other, there is the question of health as an international
matter.

These two proposals3,4 are developed by their authors in this
book and reflect the presentations made during the meeting.

The first approach starts from the idea that traditional
international health focuses on the health problems which affect
the developing countries, while the new international health
extends to health problems which affect all countries.

Traditional international health could be characterized by
an approach based on a view of developing countries which assumes
them to be homogeneous, while the new international health takes
into account the diversity between and within the developing
countries.  Traditional international health protect through
unilateral measures from the center to the periphery, while the
new international health would stimulate bilateral and
multilateral measures.  Traditional international health would be
based on the concept of aid in providing health services, while
the new international health would define the relationship
according to the concept and practice of cooperation in a gamut
which would include health teaching, research, and services.  The
approach of traditional international health would be based on
the concept of dependence, while that of new international health
would be carried out through the concept of interdependence.  In
turn, there is probably a difference of emphasis between
traditional and new international health:  while the former deals
with the communicable diseases, the latter would operate on the
basis of the epidemiologic transition.  Finally, while
traditional international health be based on primitive health
services, new international health would operate on and for the
transition of the health services.2

In the latter approach, international health is defined as a
field of public health and its interdisciplinary nature is
stressed.  Between the one and the other the difference would be
in the spheres of action:  while public health would constitute a
field of research and of action in health activities defined by
its population level and framed within the political and
administrative boundaries of the countries, international health
would take into account questions that transcend a country's
borders by using the tools of public health and information
contributed by other disciplines.

The second approach rests on two substantive factors: 
consideration of international health as a division of the vast
field of international relations which are thought of as a system
of power relationships and, in the second place, international
health as a field of health, thought of on the basis of its
internationalization as part of the transnationalization of
economics.5

These two elements are articulated to delimit a field
expressed as follows:  " ... one which corresponds to a
definition in the broad field of international relationships
considered as a political, economic, and military superstructure
which regulates relationships among nations and which we call
health as an international matter.  Health as an international
matter enables us to analyze ... the regulations, uses, and
customs of a health nature in the international framework,
financial resources, goods and services which flow from one place
to another on the planet, its participation in global flows, and
certain health events which are transformed into political
(border closings), economic (quarantines), or military events
(blockades of drugs and medical inputs, etc.)" ...  "Another line
of reflection arises from the national arenas of the Latin
American countries, i.e., from national health systems, by trying
to keep alive those phenomena or processes which are
international in nature.  We have called this second line of work
the international dimensions of health."3

From this approach an attempt would be made to reveal
dimensions which are systematically concealed in most
investigations of the health sector and which are, for example,
related to the marked and growing dependence which national
health systems have toward the transnationalized medico-
industrial complex.

From this perspective it is emphasized that the concept of
interdependence, used to take into account relationships between
countries of different technologic, economic, and military
development hides the asymmetry of such relationships.  "It is
obvious that a technologically advanced nation state needs the
markets and human and material resources of other nations in
order to guarantee its development, and in this sense there is a
certain amount of interdependence, but the quality of the two
`dependencies' is different."4


II.         Elements for defining a field

One of the advances at the meeting was the articulated
formulation of a set of questions about international health. 
Some of these questions are strategic in nature, while others are
theoretical and methodologic, and still others deal with
practices.  All of them refer to points which appeared to be
central in the discussions and implicitly or explicitly express
that need several times to construct explanatory models which
from international health lead to the search in which various
groups in the Region are engaged which, from different
disciplines, deal with the health-disease process and care
systems.

From this set of questions arise those which deal
specifically with international health as a subject of
consideration and whose point of departure is, What is meant by
the concept of international health? and continues with the
following:  When international health is spoken of, is one
referring to an explanatory model, a discipline, an intellectual
field, a problem area within public health, or a subject for
consideration?

And, in any case, What is the strategic usefulness of
arguing about legitimacy in a field appropriated by a concept
termed ethnocentric by most of the meeting's participants?

And then:  if up to now international health has had to do
with health in the developing countries defined according to the
views of certain interests in the central countries, what meaning
does the subject of international health have when seen from the
perspective of the peripheral countries?  And in such a case, Is
it pertinent to work out a view of international health which has
an explanatory capacity about the problems we have to confront in
the Region and therefore important in the North and South?

What are the body of knowledge, specific skills, and the
field of application of international health?

These and other questions should be dealt with in order to
define the nature of the question.  Some of them are also found
in the studies presented here.


1.          Why international health?

Without other intent than to initiate a problematization
and, in any case, a contextualization of the foregoing questions,
it is understood that it is important to observe that, in the
concern of the teams which are trying to develop international
health as a subject of reflection two observations converge, the
first sociohistorical in nature and the second of a theoretical
character.

In the first, reference is made to the intensification of
economic and political processes at the global level during the
past decade, with repercussions in the health field, which have
resulted in the adoption in the Region of economic adjustment
measures which lessen the ability of health systems to care for
the health of the population at the same time that poverty
increases and health conditions worsen.

As noted in one of the studies presented in this
publication, at the beginning of the 1990s the Latin American
economies had experienced a serious economic regression which
accentuated their basic characteristics of rates of inflation,
external indebtedness, and inequalities in distribution of income
which are among the highest in the world.6

Latin America's economic regression, as another of the
studies published notes, imposed to a large extent by concealment
of the geopolitical nature of external debt, occur in a world
which has undergone changes during the past decade characterized
by the development of the multipolarity of the centers of world
power, a period of instability in the industrialized countries
characterized by chronic inflationary processes, reduction in
their rates of growth and disequilibriums in the balance of
payments, inclusion of the peripheral countries in the new world
order under conditions of asymmetry characterized in the economic
sphere by the internationalization of their national markets and
by the external indebtedness and a strengthening of the
relationships of economic and political interdependence
stimulated by the expansion of financial markets, the interests
of transnational companies, and the opening of economic borders
caused by decontrol of exchange rates.5

The industrialized countries take part in this process of
economic internationalization by forming internal alliances among
economic interests, cooperation agencies, and the state.  For
that purpose, they also redefine the role of the state and adapt
their national policies on the basis of the new stage and, in
turn, formulate through it the rules which stimulate trade
exchanges and different bilateral and multilateral forms of
cooperation.

Meanwhile, the periphery attends this process with national
states weakened by those who impose integration rules on them
which are often contrary to national interests because of the
external indebtedness and relationships of subordination with the
centers of power.

In Latin America there is discussion about the need for
regional integration as a way to deal with such a situation of
subordination. It is recognized that the health sector can
contribute thereto by drawing up joint policies designed and
implemented through different mechanisms of technical and
financial cooperation among countries.

To support the processes of drawing up such joint policies,
whether they are governmental in nature or not, as well as to
take account of the socioeconomic and health conditions in which
they will be formulated, a level of explanation is required which
can be seated in the field of international health, as will be
defined below.

The foregoing does not mean that that level of explanation
required cannot be found through another kind of approach, but
that the concept of international health necessarily refers to
the consideration that the sociohistorical and health conditions
mentioned above with an implicit unity of analysis which is the
global social system.

Up to this point the sociohistorical reasons which draw us
to international health, a characterization of which are set out
in the first part of this book.

The second observation to which we refer is theoretical in
nature and is based on the notion that explanatory models which
try to take into account economic, political, health-system
processes which Latin America is experiencing are passing through
a crisis or stagnation which began about fifteen years ago and
corresponds to that of the model of Latin American development
promoted since the 1950s.

Both public health and the social sciences and social
sciences applied to health are in a process of constructing new
approaches which include a reconstruction of its epistemologic,
theoretical, and thematic basis which go beyond those which today
seem mechanistic explanations with slight power of explanation
and prediction.

Equally, in the social sciences and in public health,
present ability to intervene and the lack of effectiveness of
activities undertaken of normative and ahistorical principals is
questioned.

The concerns of the teams which are trying to develop the
field of international health thus occur in a movement which
attempts to undertake the construction of new analytic frameworks
by recovering the knowledge produced in a group of areas and
disciplines of which it forms part.  Such analytic frameworks
will in turn support the configuration of alternatives of
intervention in accordance with the explanations obtained.


2.          Elements for defining a concept of international health

Approaches can be found in the bibliography on international
health which present it as a discipline, others which describe it
as an approach or an explanatory model, and still others which
define it as a field.  Some of these approaches are illustrated
in the studies presented in this book, while others have served
as a basis for preparing some of the articles which were
discussed at the meeting.

In the bibliography published on international health which
defines it as a field are authors who limit that field to a set
of activities of international technical and financial
cooperation in health and those who define it as a field of
professional knowledge and practice.

In the perspective proposed here, international health is
not a discipline in the sense of consisting of a particular body
of knowledge and methodology, nor is public health a discipline. 
International health is shaped on the basis of the knowledge
produced by different disciplines which converges in an area of
specific problematization.

According to the direction which we have opted to examine,
the concept of international health refers to two levels, which
it is pertinent to limit:  the first refers to international
health as an approach and the second to a field of study and
practice.  In this view, the two levels are not exclusive; on the
contrary, it is understood that they participate in delimiting a
field from a particular approach.

The approach in international health attempts to make
reference to a dimension of analysis of the health-disease
process and the care systems which involves explicit
consideration or not of a set of determinations which occur on a
global scale and which not only refer to economic and political
processes but also to health ones.  In this approach, the
category of totality is both a theoretical and methodologic
requirement in the construction of the subjects of study.

Going beyond some reductionist approaches to public health
involves not only switching from a sectoral to a multisectoral
viewpoint, or from an institutional one to a relational approach
with an axis set in the social groups, but also transition to
consideration of the world social system as a unit of
reproduction in power relationships, which in varying degree
influence the configuration of the morbidity and mortality
profile as well as the structure, execution, and response
capacity of health systems.

Explaining the health-disease process and care systems in
most cases involves bearing in mind the global operation of the
capitalist system and the international division of work between
the central capitalist countries and the periphery and asymmetry
in the power relationships which spring from that structure.

In the second place, an attempt is made through the concept
of international health to limit a field of professional study
and practice by adopting an alternative to the traditional
definition, according to which international health is the study
of health in the underdeveloped countries.

In this alternative view, the term international health is
used to designate a field of research and intervention which
designates the international dimensions of the health-disease
process and care systems.  This refers to a level of analysis
which includes focusing on external economic, political, and
health determinants as well as reciprocal determination of the
health of populations.

To take account of the problems identified in this field,
the articulation of knowledge produced in different disciplines
is required.

The processes of intervention in international health
include, among other dimensions, international technical and
financial cooperation in health and analysis of the assumptions
and mechanisms on the basis of which such cooperation is defined.

An approach to these characteristics may reveal other levels
of explanations than those customarily offered by public health
by promoting the production of information about international
arenas and the external processes which influence national health
systems.


3.          International health and commitment

One of the emphases of the meeting was on the idea that
talking of international health also involves recognizing a
dimension of political activity which defines the service from
which the strategic project will be the information produced and
the practices derived from it.  This was again noted basically
because international health is defined as a field of
intervention as well as a field of professional study and
practice.

If the activities of one country can be used as both an tool
of diplomacy and cooperation and of domination, then an
independent approach in international health has a role to play
in supporting the strengthening of solidarity among peoples.

This commitment also involves the production of information
about strategic problem areas which support both the development
of health awareness at the level of social groups as well as the
unlinking of processes oriented to redefining the relationships
of subordination of the peripheral countries to the central ones.

At the level of the training of human resources, in addition
to the academic aspects related to the training of investigators
in various disciplines oriented to scientific production, it is
important to consider the spheres of international action in
which a sizable part of the practices in the subject which
concerns us are carried out and the commitment of the subjects
toward the processes of cooperation.

As the study which refers to PAHO's international health
program noted, "... the articulation of a subject in a practice
of cooperation per se does not guarantee the transformation of
the individual nor the execution of a commitment.  An uncritical
articulation which only gives an individual knowledge of how to
be a successful manager, without real commitment to the
countries, would be really frustrating.  We believe that the
dynamic of carrying out the process, collective reflection, and
the effort of the individual aware of his responsibility as a
social subject are basic elements in ensuring adequate
interaction of the participants in the different arenas of work
of the institution and is an element enhancing his future
employment."

The program has been quite clear in that its objective is
not to train individuals to enter the competitive market, or what
Taussig calls the grants rat race.  On the contrary, we are
convinced that the individual should not only formulate a
project, determine the financing institutions and their policies,
but and above all should determine the impact or the implications
of assistance, the role they play, the timeliness of their
awarding, and the responsibility for following up their
utilization.  We would not like our former residents to enter
this labor market of experts who parade around the countries
without any commitment and with complete unsettling of the
country and the groups they are supposed to help and for which
they are remunerated.  We therefore repeat that the most
important thing in this articulation in the work of international
health is that technical excellence that includes mutual
commitment.  Recognizing that work in international health is not
only determining the technical and financial resources which
exist in the field, is not only being an uncritical participant
in that history."7


III.        Some proposals

It should be pointed out that the contributions made during
the meeting focused basically on the aspects noted above, without
for reasons of time being able to deal in depth with proposals
for carrying out lines of work at the different levels.

The proposals which are set out here were in part drawn from
those made by the participants during the discussions and can be
organized in two categories:  the first are those which have to
do with the production of knowledge; the second are those which
deal with aspect of training human resources in the field.


1.          Production of knowledge

It is understood that it is necessary to conduct the
production of knowledge at three main levels:  (a) in each of the
problem areas which appear to be the most noteworthy in the field
of international health; (b) in the aspects of conception,
transmission of knowledge, and practice in international health,
and (c) of the processes and mechanisms of international
technical and financial cooperation in health.

(a)        The problem areas initially identified were:  (1) the
health-disease process:  the international determinants of
environmental health (including the environment and occupational
health); (2) the health-disease process:  profiles or morbidity
and mortality, opening of borders, and communicable diseases; (3)
processes of health care:  the medical-industrial complex, the
medical model, and dissemination of service models on an
international scale; (4) processes of health care:  comparative
national health systems; (5) processes of health care: 
comparative informal health care systems; (6) the health-disease
process and international policies on controlling birth rates,
communicable diseases, and developing national health services.

(b)        A second aspect to take into account is production of
information based on the field of international health taken as a
subject of reflection, i.e., those aspects having to do with the
study of the conception, transmission of knowledge, and practice
in international health.  The objectives would be to (1)
reconstruct the emergence and development of the concept of
international health and analyze the historical processes which
affected it; (2) continue research on the teaching of
international health in schools of public health in the United
States by determining the times of structuring of the units and
their determinants, as well as the amounts and origins of the
financing obtained; (3) making a survey of the academic
institutions in Latin America which work in fields which, because
of their content, are interested in the field of international
health, not limiting this to the programs of schools of public
health, and (4) studying the state of thought in international
health, which means the updating of information in each of the
identified problem areas.

(c)        Finally, it was thought that information must be
produced about the processes and mechanisms of international
technical and financial cooperation in health.  The main aspects
are (1) international cooperation in health:  international
economic and political determinants in the processes of
cooperation; (2) international cooperation in health:  the actors
and arenas in the processes of international cooperation; nations
and agencies, banks and cooperation agencies; strategies; and (3)
international cooperation in health:  international policies
regarding health and how they are implemented.


2.          Training human resources in the field of international
health

The characteristics of the training of human resources in
the field of international health are determined both by the
approaches employed by training institutions and the spheres of
recruitment of qualified staff.

To analyze the interests of the training institutions, the
objectives which are pursued in the field of international health
in each institution, and the national needs according to which
they operate to definitively design the nature of training in
this field as well as the arenas of professional practice, a
process of regional discussion must be undertaken which deals
with matters such as (1) the scope of training in international
health:  area of specialization or supplementary training
programs for public health workers, social scientists, or
specialists in international affairs; (2) scope of training in
international health:  public health-international health
articulation, analyzed at both the theoretical and methodologic
levels, of the delimitation of their subjects of study and
intervention, as well as matters dealing with prevailing or
anticipated professionalization in each area; (3) scope of
training in international health:  training institutions and
limitations or not on training in schools of public health; (4)
scope of training in international health:  definition of
curricula linked to the production of information in the field,
and (5) scope of training in international health:  programs of
training for international cooperation in health.


IV.         Final thoughts

We have so far presented an outline of the contributions
made during the discussions at the Quebec meeting and certain
proposals worked out on the basis of analysis of the reports and
discussions.

The significance the meeting may will depend on the ability
of those who took part in it to move forward and deepen the
orientations which were profiled and, in turn, promote the
production of information, training of human resources, and
action in the field of international health in relevant spheres
in accordance with a concept which goes beyond the limitations of
the classical models and appropriately establishes the actors
linked to the commitment to health and solidarity among peoples.

PANAMA
     The general purpose of the health policy of the Government
of Panama is to achieve for all inhabitants in the country a
level of well-being and health which enables them to live better
and lead lives useful to their families and the entire national
community.

       The institutions in the health sector--the Ministry of
Health, which is the regulatory unit, the Social Security Fund,
and the National Institute of Water Supply and Sewerage Systems-
-each has its own identity, carry out their programs in
coordination, and form a decentralized, pluralist, and
articulated National Health System in which responsible
participation by the community is promoted.

     During the year the health authorities continued
strengthening local health systems to provide greater flexibility
at the local level in using their resources and to motivate them
to program, carry out, and evaluate their own health activities. 
Responsibility for the administration of policies and health
standards continues at the central level.

     The efforts and national resources of the health sector were
oriented toward the prevention, surveillance, and control of the
problems or conditions that affect the great majority of the
population.  The maternal and child, workers' health,
environmental sanitation, old age, chronic and social disease,
communicable disease, and vector control health programs were
strengthened; a national policy on human resources in the sector
was formulated in which coordination is established with
institutions training health resources; and policies on drugs and
information science systems for health management were prepared. 
To develop the physical health infrastructure, the application of
technical and economic criteria in the planning of installations
and equipment was promoted, and a national system of medical
equipment and physical infrastructure maintenance was
established.

     PAHO/WHO's technical cooperation with the country responded
to the cooperation priorities proposed by the national
authorities and was framed within the strategic orientations and
programming priorities defined by the Governing Bodies.  The
principal axis of cooperation was support for local health system
development in a search for an adequate strategy for coordinating
the Organization's various programs in the country.  The policy
of decentralization continued to be applied, and the training of
personnel for local levels in various aspects of management was
given support, mainly in administrative systems, maintenance,
statistics, planning, local programming, use of computers, and
administration of health services.  There was collaboration with
the National Commission on Drugs in regard to the selection,
purchase, quality control, storage, distribution, and use of
drugs, information for patients, remodeling and equipment,
personnel training, and the establishment of pharmacies within
local health systems.

     Special situations made it necessary to introduce
significant changes in the programs of the Ministry of Health and
also in PAHO/WHO's technical cooperation.  An important region of
the country, in addition to experiencing an earthquake in April,
suffered heavy floods in May which caused destruction in the
infrastructure of the health services, including water and
sewerage networks.  In addition, in September the epidemic of
cholera made its appearance, strongly attacking one of the most
disadvantaged regions in the country.  PAHO/WHO supported the
national program of emergency preparedness and disaster relief
coordination, and because of the epidemic of cholera cooperated
with the Ministry of Health in the control, surveillance, and
treatment of cases.  It also collaborated with technical
personnel in the Ministry and the communities in organization,
logistical support, and health education to control and treat
diarrheal diseases.

     In collaboration with the Program of Training in Health for
Central America and Panama (PASCAP) and the Schools of Medicine
and Public Health of the University of Panama, the Organization
reviewed the curricula of the regional teaching units and gave
financial assistance to 12 fellows so that they could participate
in the master' degree course in public health which the latter
School offers.

     Through INCAP, PAHO/WHO provided technical advisory services
and financial support to several national projects for defining
policies on nutrition, the introduction of food and nutrition
components in the formal teaching curricula, research on iodine
deficiency, and oral health in schoolchildren.  In addition, the
Organization worked jointly with the Ministry of Agriculture in
programs to improve seeds and food production, and with the
Spanish Agency of International Cooperation (Spain) and the
Ministries of Agriculture, Education, and Health in the
production of the fortified foods "PANACREMA" and the "Enriched
Cookie."

     PAHO/WHO collaborated with the Interinstitutional Committee
on Water, Sanitation, and the Environment in carrying out
projects to mobilize external resources, and with the National
Technical Commission against Cholera on aspects of water quality
control, environmental sanitation, and elimination of hospital
wastes.

     In regard to workers' health, the national authorities were
supported in planning activities to define and implement a
national program in this field.

     In maternal and child health, PAHO/WHO cooperated in
training personnel in the management of programs and in self-
management projects; it tried to bring about the participation of
adolescents in activities to prevent and control sexually
transmitted diseases, family planning, AIDS, the improper use of
drugs, tobacco, alcoholism, and adolescent pregnancy.  The
Organization continued cooperating with the National Department
of Epidemiology in the activities of the Expanded Program on
Immunization (EPI); follow-up and evaluation of vaccination
coverage was established, and specific activities were carried
out to serve population groups that still had not received
immunization services.  PAHO/WHO also collaborated in purchasing
biologicals for the EPI, chain cold surveillance, and personnel
training.

     The national program against AIDS received considerable
support from the Organization, mainly in matters relating to
epidemiological surveillance, prevention of transmission by blood
and blood derivatives, and health education, as well as
logistical support and the supply of materials, equipment, and
other inputs.

     During the year PAHO/WHO cooperated with the National
Service for the Eradication of Malaria in the campaign against
malaria and the vector Aedes aegypti.  In addition, it provided
support for the mental health, hypertension, diabetes, smoking,
food safety, zoonosis control, and foot-and-mouth disease
surveillance programs.

     The National Focal Group of the Program on Women, Health,
and Development received technical advisory services and economic
support from PAHO/WHO to carry out activities aimed at its
strengthening and development.

     During the year nearly 90 foreign experts provided technical
advisory services through the Organization for a total of
approximately 300 days.  In addition, the Organization
contributed technically and financially to holding 359 national
seminars with 14,062 participants and to the participation of 163
nationals in 80 seminars, workshops, and meetings abroad. 
Through the Organization's purchasing program, several national
institutions acquired materials, vehicles, parts, drugs,
vaccines, and other inputs.

CHAPTER V

DEVELOPMENT OF HEALTH PROGRAMS


INTRODUCTION


     During 1991 the application of the strategic orientations
and programming priorities for the Pan American Health
Organization during the 1991-1994 quadrennium were promoted. 
Efforts focused on the lines of action of greatest impact for
articulated execution of technical cooperation programs, and
emphasis was put on intersectoral cooperation and social
participation in national programs to promote health and
environmental health.

     Periodic meetings of the program coordinators and the
Organization's Pan American centers were held in order to analyze
information about the planning, execution, surveillance, and
evaluation of the programs and projects concerning the
performance and development of personnel, budget management, and
generation of scientific and technical documents.

     Progress was made in articulating plans of work, and quite
concrete results were achieved in joint, coordinated, and
institutional action among the centers, the regional programs,
and PAHO/WHO's Country Representatives' offices in the countries.

     Plans of action were shaped for every program and Pan
American center in the Area of Development of Health Programs for
1992-1995.  The experience acquired during the year was
appropriately documented so that this information can be utilized
by the Bureau of the Organization, the Member Governments, and
other interested agencies and institutions.

     Critical analysis continued of the quality and quantity of
technical cooperation activities; progress was made in
identifying and quantifying indicators to measure the factors
which determine efficiency, effectiveness, and equity, and the
structure, process, and impact of technical and financial
cooperation provided to the countries were evaluated.

     The mechanisms for the most efficient execution of joint,
interprogram, and intercenter activities and projects were
reviewed by working groups of experts, committees, and action
nuclei for manpower development in the Secretariat itself;
manpower development in the countries; research proposals and
projects, feasibility studies, direct technical cooperation;
mobilization of scientific, technical, and financial resources;
development of plans, standards and manuals, and generation and
dissemination of scientific and technical information, for which
