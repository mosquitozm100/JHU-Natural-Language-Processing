the
family so that it assumes responsibility for the care
of the patient in the home.

     Home care as an isolated activity loses
effectiveness.  For this reason, it is recommended that
the Pan American Health Organization reinstate home
care as a basic primary care activity in order to
reintroduce it into the local health services and
develop coordinated joint actions that encompass the
three principal areas of health care:  continuous
ambulatory and hospital medical care, community
support, and home care.

     The Member States of the Pan American Health
Organization accepted the world strategy of health for
all by the year 2000, which envisages community
participation as a fundamental policy.  However, the
participation of the community organizations in the
activities for the control of AIDS has generated tense
situations in some countries, which must be relieved if
really effective cooperation is to be achieved.

     Finally, the recommendation is made to the
countries to adopt specific policies and mechanisms to
provide decisive backing, through technical advisory
services and support in the form of resources, to the
participation of community organizations in the
planning and in the execution of activities against
AIDS.

HEALTH AND DEVELOPMENT OF INDIGENOUS WOMEN
IN CENTRAL AMERICA AND PANAMA


SUBREGIONAL PROJECT














PROGRAM ON WOMEN, HEALTH AND DEVELOPMENT

Guatemala, October 1991





1. BACKGROUND

     Beginning in the 1980s, with the arrival of civil governments
in the Central American area, the population of the region began
to develop expectations that they would be able to actively
participate in the various development projects that each country
was planning and implementing.

     To a greater or lesser degree these expectations failed to be
realized either because the political intent of government
interventions inhibited popular participation or because the will
of the government was constrained by the behavior and customs that
prevailed in the sociopolitical life of these countries.  In the
case of the indigenous communities, cultural violence, for example,
is and has been a major obstacle to people's active participation
in strengthening their own capacities.  In most cases, it is
attempted to impose the goals of "development" on these people,
using Western society as the model and overlooking the fact that
within the populations themselves lies the power to generate an
alternative process which is rooted in their culture and led by
women as the principal transmitters of that culture.

     Recent United Nations evaluations show a serious decline in
the living conditions of the greater part of the population, and
with good reason we speak today of a lost decade, aggravated by the
human rights questions that arise as well. 

     In light of the difficulties occurring at the government level
as efforts are made to achieve sustained development, populations
are looking for opportunities to be the planners and subjects of
their own development.  Thus, a diversity of organizations has
sprung up at the community, rural, and ethnic level in every
Central American country.  The I International Seminar on Indian
Peoples, which was held recently in Guatemala, was attended by more
than 200 representatives who took a united stand in favor of
Culturally Rooted Development.  At the rural level, community
structures are seeking to become promoters of self-development
which is based on having the subject serve as the planner and
author of improvements in his own living conditions.

     Undeniably, the development philosophy that prevailed during
the 1970s and 80s, which focused solely on production factors, lost
sight of the importance of human factors and of the human
preference for alternative development strategies.  This has been
and still is forcing us to revise strategies so that we can
readdress the notion of subjects from the perspective of gender as
a key factor in the development process.

     Thus, in indigenous groups, women are the central axis around
which revolve the entire group culture and the transmission of
values.  Conducting in-depth research to learn about the problems
of these women, strengthening their training as a multiplier
factor, and examining the prospects for providing medical and
health support to them through alternative models of care are the
challenges that we face in trying to reverse the population's
negative trends in the area of health. 
 
1.1  PROJECT BEGINNINGS

     The subregional program on Women, Health, and Development that
is promoted by PAHO opened the doors to the possibility of
presenting a project aimed at improving the health of indigenous
women in the subregion, involving women in the search for solutions
to the health problems they face, and promoting self-evaluation,
self-care, and development, in response to one of the
recommendations made on this subject in Nicaragua between 28 August
and 1 September 1989.

     An evaluation prepared by Garro Valverde (1991) under the
subregional program shows that indigenous people are in a
precarious health situation whose corollaries are high infant
mortality, a high incidence of infectious and parasitic diseases,
and serious difficulties with gaining real access to health
services.

     Added to this is the vast experience obtained in the field
under the program on Women in Health and Development which, in
addition to confirming the merit of certain traditional medical
practices, such as delivery in a squatting position, has
highlighted the low impact that the official health apparatus is
having on the indigenous population.  This poor impact results from
the contrast between the centralized sanitary apparatus, which
operates through vertical hierarchical relationships and uses
European-North American philosophies, and a target population which
to a greater or lesser degree uses various cultural patterns as its
point of reference.  In addition, the program's progress today
reveals the need to gain a more in-depth knowledge of the
situational problems of indigenous women through experiences in the
field which will make it possible to understand their specific
world view, so that the activities that the project can promote are
practical and concrete responses to the concerns and needs
expressed by these women, according to a perspective that is in
harmony with their way of thinking and philosophy of life.  The
project is based on an approach which makes women the core of the
analysis, based on a reconsideration of the human factor in
development and the human preference for alternative strategies. 
The role of the family in general and of women in particular will
take on special importance in the measure that we are successful
in committing a large number of women to becoming participants in
health projects in particular, and in development in general, areas
of marginal involvement for them until now. 

1.2  CHARACTERIZATION OF THE PROBLEMS OF THE HEALTH SERVICES IN THE
     INDIGENOUS COMMUNITIES, AND OF INDIGENOUS WOMEN IN PARTICULAR

     The public entities that operate in the health sector in the
subregion have encountered serious problems when they have
penetrated or attempted to penetrate indigenous areas.  Culture
shock, a lack of mutual knowledge, and the existence of different
models and practices are influential factors when the impact and
coverage of these services is evaluated.

     The difficulty experienced by public health entities when they
try to penetrate and gain credibility in the indigenous areas is
a consequence of the relative inflexibility of the public model,
which obeys a logic different from that which governs the
communities in question.  Traditional medical practices, idea
systems regarding disease, internalized notions of the human body
and its workings are subjects that have been already studied by
anthropology; however, Western medicine and the health programs
have underutilized this information and have failed to develop a
frame of reference that makes it possible to identify the
nosological symptoms and framework of modern medicine that would
correspond to the symptoms and pathological signs of traditional
medicine.

     The existing medical models implemented by the governments
have felt the impact of the structural adjustment programs; this
impact is reflected also in the high cost of medicine today.  A
population's economic capacity to access a service is a significant
factor when considering what types of services can be purchased or
paid for.  Where it is possible to have access to imported drugs,
difficulties arise with regulating the doses, above all because it
is left up to the pharmacy owner to request information about drugs
that might be useful in combating a given set of pathological signs
and symptoms, although in most cases, these pharmaceutical
personnel do not have the knowledge or basic training they need to
respond to consultations.  Donations do not constitute a solution
either, and all the cooperation programs have confirmed that when
work proceeds according to this philosophy, there is a decrease in
the value of the activities and the impact of the projects.
 
     The lack of reliable data on the health situation of the
population in these groups is an important factor when it comes to
determining and establishing social policy, especially health
policy.  In Guatemala, data is available on the health status of
the population at the municipal level; in Honduras, the data that
has already been prepared and published uses the departmental level
as its point of reference; in Costa Rica, there is an even more
detailed breakdown, with information available all the way through
the district level.  All this information is scattered, and there
aren't any tables that permit subregional comparisons.

     Health policies directed toward women are not established
based on an analysis of health status by gender.  Health workers
are unfamiliar with the social and health conditions of the women
belonging to various ethnic groups.  There is no information on the
diseases and problems of women according to age group, and as a
result, the public programs directed toward this population do not
reflect what is really going on within the female population. 
According to the roles prescribed within ethnic communities, women
are traditionally responsible for providing the family's basic
needs, and unquestionably the way that social policies are planned
to meet basic needs has a considerable impact on women.

     The ideology and culture of these subregional ethnic groups
embody an idea system that differs from the Western one.  At the
level of health, their idea system in relation to disease is
closely related to their specific religious beliefs.  The divine
mandate involved in exercising a cure must not be underestimated,
since religion and propitiatory rites are important to that cure,
especially when the disease is considered to have supernatural
causes, or when the suffering has been imposed as a divine
punishment because the sufferer has failed to respect the moral
code of the group.  The official health services have not been and
are not able to meet the cultural needs of these groups, and the
lack of a language for communication makes it even more difficult
and expensive for the programs to have any impact.

     Research carried out by MUDAR (Women for Alternative
Development) shows that women and ethnic and racial groups are
particularly hard hit during periods of crisis.  A lack of access
to land in the case of Guatemala and El Salvador, a shrinking of
rural investments in the case of Honduras, the ongoing conflicts
in Nicaragua and El Salvador, and the lack of opportunities for
well-paid work in the case of Costa Rica are all factors that have
a decisive influence on women.  Women are migrating from the
country at a rate that is increasing all the time.  This
transformation is laying the groundwork for a series of changes
within rural families, and although there has certainly already
been discussion of the effect that the increase in work-for-
pay among women has had on gender roles within the family, we have
yet to take a closer look at the impact of these changes on their
health conditions, and at their repercussions for the nuclear
family.

     The prevailing patterns with regard to fertility, age at
marriage, and beliefs and customs surrounding pregnancy need to be
studied in depth, because this will produce basic information that
will allow us to learn in greater detail what types of services can
be provided, as well as to identify gender-specific health
problems.  Breastfeeding is an example of a cultural practice that
continues to be present in the most traditional societies.  In the
sixties, inadequate information on the part of health workers and
other factors fostered the abandonment of this beneficial practice;
today, efforts are being made to reverse this trend, but at the
same time much remains to be done in order to improve the paired
elements of maternal lactation and maternal nutrition which have
such an impact on the health of women and their families.

1.3. PREVIOUS WORK CARRIED OUT

     International agencies such as UNIFEM-UNICEF, WHO, PAHO, and
the private development organizations, as well as some
universities, have dedicated themselves in recent years to studying
women's current situation from the perspective of gender.  Most of
their work has taken into account urban problems, level of
industrialization, and the crisis and its effects on society in
general and on women in particular.  There are almost no gender-
based studies of the health problems of women in rural areas, and
of ethnic groups in particular, or of their relationship to a
greater or lesser degree of development in the community, despite
the fact that today these are considered to be a useful tool for
programs and projects whose priority it is to exercise a multiplier
effect on development.

     Some work done mainly in Guatemala brings out the importance
of integrating traditional medicine and the primary health care
system.  Since the 1950s, a study has been available which analyzes
the medical beliefs and practices of an indigenous people in
Guatemala (Adams, 1952), along with a working document which
classifies the indigenous population in terms of the acculturation
process (Adams, 1960) and makes it possible to distinguish
traditional groups, groups that have modified their traditional
culture, and acculturated groups, which bear a closer resemblance
to the mestizo population. 

     In the seventies, attention was turned to the problem of the
acculturation process and its relationship to ethnocentric
attitudes and underdevelopment.  One field study (Ghidinelli, 1976)
showed the situation of the family in particular, as well as the
situation among married couples in three ethnic groups (Ladino,
Caribe, and Kekchie) of Guatemala.  In 1977, the results of a study
on Maya-Quiché food appeared (Henne, 1977), and this information
was rounded out by a project that presented some ideas about the
hot-cold/wet-dry syndrome among the Quiché (Nevenswander and
Saunder, 1977).

     During the 1980s, in addition to several analyses on the
acculturation process among the Mayan and the Caribe population,
there was renewed interest in learning about indigenous ideas
regarding the structure, workings, and diseases of the human body. 
This work brought out the importance of gaining as thorough a
knowledge as possible of these ideas about the human body as a
preliminary step toward more extensive research on how a healer or
parchero within an ethnic group can cure certain diseases, and how
the idea system is related to the acculturation process (Ghidinelli
1981, 1986).

     At the end of 1989 in Guatemala, a private development
organization began a research project whose fundamental objective
was to take a more in-depth look at traditional Maya-Quiché
medicine, with a view toward facilitating integration with the
primary health care sector.  This body and its grass-roots
organization made a general assessment of priority health needs,
and held a workshop attended by personnel from the regional
hospital and traditional physicians whose principal objective was
to exchange information on the health activities being carried out
by the two groups.

     In Honduras, the IICA formulated a technical cooperation
project aimed at strengthening the institutional capacity of the
public sector to direct and coordinate rural development, and
presenting policy guidelines for development among autochthonous
ethnic groups.  An integral part of this project was the priority
execution of special health training programs which would take
advantage of the knowledge of natural medicine that is found among
ethnic peoples.  A joint project by the University of Costa Rica
and the Costa Rican Ministry of Health on the health of the
Amerindian populations brought out the difference between the
country's indigenous and non-indigenous communities, as well as the
need to be able to formulate alternative health policies that
collect information on cultural background and these communities'
views on health problems.

     It is important to mention some more recent work, such as the
research on mortality in women of reproductive age, with emphasis
on maternal mortality in the area of the Honduran Moskitia (Coello,
Maldonado, and Romero, 1990).  This project indicated that for
every 100,000 live births, 781 women were dying from causes related
to pregnancy, delivery, or the puerperium, a rate 15 times higher
than that reported by the Ministry of Public Health.  The death
rate for women of reproductive age was 2.29 per 1000 per year.  The
principal cause was maternal death, which represented 48% of total
deaths.  93% of the maternal deaths occurred outside of the
hospital setting.  The risk of dying for a pregnant women of
reproductive age was 1 in 148.  These maternal health indicators
are the most serious in Latin America, and are exceeded only by
those in some regions of Africa.

     To conclude, it can be said that this project today is an
attempt, above all, to reshape the capacity that ethnic groups, and
women in particular, have to strengthen alternative forms of
support for the health sector.  The work done at both the
theoretical and practical level will provide a basis for more
extensive research and detailed work that will allow health workers
to involve the population as the subjects of their own development,
using women as the key element of the process, and focusing on the
American subregion which is most affected by starvation, drought,
a crisis in food, energy, and water, and the external debt.

1.4. WOMEN IN A TIME OF CRISIS.

     The Kissinger report, the Sandford Commission, and studies by
ECLA, the World Bank, IDB, FAO, SIECA, UNDP, PAHO, WHO, and UNICEF
confirm that even in countries that are experiencing economic
growth, the benefits are distributed unequally, and there is a
prevalence of high rates of unemployment, underemployment, poverty,
indigence, illiteracy, and rural marginality, among other
indicators of socioeconomic problems.  In Central America, periods
of war and upheaval have led to diminished respect for the human
condition, a loss of sources of work and income, and a reduction
in state services, which has aggravated conditions in social
sectors in which the poor are usually more disadvantaged as well
as more numerous.  It is, therefore, imperative to try to
strengthen those aspects which, because of their originality and
fresh approach, provide alternatives for reversing the downward
trend in the living conditions of the population.

     As has been clearly shown in some studies of gender,
development affects men and women differently, and with few
exceptions, it can be said that the crisis in the region has
increased women's workload while at the same time it has decreased
their levels of health, nutrition, and education.  Central American
women, especially indigenous women, have never had high rates of
access to the benefits of a formal education, and so there is a
need for training outside the classroom in place of school-based
education.

     The incorporation of women into the labor market is an 
irreversible trend, and it is leading to culture shock and identity
problems in all women, whether or not they belong to more or less
traditional groups:  emotionally, women continue to be the central
axis for the economy of the home, health, education, socialization,
etc.  Topics such as subsistence and the maintenance of the home
come up in economic discussions, and the problem of the informal
economy is brought out for discussion as well, sparking sharp
polemic among specialists.

     Education and its impact on women has been analyzed, and the
conclusion is that it is essential for women to be given greater
educational opportunities, but ones that are based on
methodological alternatives that are compatible with the changes
that are being brought about, and the cultures of the indigenous
people (AID, 1989).

     The link between crisis and the organization of women has
facilitated the emergence of numerous women's groups throughout the
subregion who are seeking to play a more important role in
development on an equitable basis.  In June 1991, more than 40
representatives of women's organizations in Central America met in
Guatemala to find a common platform so that the voice of the
subregion can be heard at the next world conference on women.  This
group included women from both urban and rural areas, including
women belonging to various Central American ethnic groups.  One of
the working forums centered on an analysis of public policies and
their relationship to the situation of women; this analysis showed
that in all the countries, public policies in support of women are
currently in a gestation process, and that without decisive
intervention and popular pressure, it will be difficult for them
to go from being mere pieces of paper to become a reality (Messén,
1991).

     This meeting grew out of the fact that the women in these five
countries felt that they had no voice in the Region. 
Paradoxically, the Central American indigenous women said the same
thing on this occasion with regard to the representativity and
validity of the generalizations that affect gender relationships
among indigenous and mestiza women (Messén, 1991).

     Undoubtedly at this time an entire strategy for communication
between women is being created which can strengthen the
dissemination of information and programs that are useful and
functional.  Women in general are referring to the search for
alternative strategies that can reduce poverty and allow them to
participate in the decision-making process.

     With the experience gained through the Program on Women,
Health, and Development and other programs that support women, and
based on the information and interest demonstrated by each of the
countries in the subregion with regard to strengthening and
reshaping the role that ethnic groups play in socioeconomic
development, the need arises as well to center each series of
activities around an axis that will revitalize society.  In this
sense, indigenous woman as the guardians of their cultures and the
conveyers of standards and values can become a key element of
development, in the measure that they are allowed to participate
actively and on an equal basis in shaping a more just future for
their society.

     The project being presented today is the first attempt at the
Regional level to preserve the role of indigenous women and to
strengthen them as protagonists for positive change toward a better
future.  The project has been drawn up with a comprehensive
perspective, based on the view that health is not an isolated
event, but rather the result or product of the interaction of the
various economic, social, and political conditions in a society. 
And while all these obviously cannot be modified by a single
project, such a project provides guidelines for reversing the
strategies employed in the past decades, utilizing health as an
input for development and establishing new models for relationships
within the health system so that there can be harmony and
acceptance among the various tasks that can be undertaken at the
national level, not only in this field but in all areas of human
endeavor. 

     The specific characteristics of this project require it to be
coordinated by the PAHO Offices in each country; PAHO's
counterparts would be each of the Ministries in the subregion, and
nongovernmental organizations and/or groups of organized indigenous
women, with strong backing provided by the universities that show
an interest in taking part.  Each national project is free to take
on those counterparts that are considered most appropriate to its
phase of execution.


2.   JUSTIFICATION OF THE PROJECT

2.1. CURRENT SITUATION OF THE HEALTH SECTOR IN THE SUBREGION FROM
     AN ETHNIC AND GENDER-RELATED PERSPECTIVE 

     Something common to the subregion is an almost total lack of
statistical, demographic, and health information referring to the
situation of the ethnic groups.  The breakdown of variables by sex
is limited, in the case of women, to their reproductive stage
alone: as a result, it is impossible today to specify how the
variable of gender is influencing women's health conditions or
leading to other, as yet unreported, problems. 

     Guatemala is the only country that distinguishes the
indigenous population from the nonindigenous one.  Costa Rica has
the best reporting system in the subregion, but by constitutional
mandate does make any racial or cultural distinctions in its
information.  Statistical underreporting, which is common to all
the countries, makes it impossible to get any accurate picture of
the number of people in each ethnic group or of the health
conditions that affect this population.  Therefore, the various
national projects need to devote themselves to the preliminary work
of collecting and making use of the data available from the
censuses, the Ministries of Health, public and private agencies,
and national organizations.

     Summing up the data presented by each country, the indigenous
population of the subregion can be estimated at some 6,308,060. 
There are differences between these inhabitants with regard to
language, culture, and traditions, but they all have the common
denominators of illiteracy, low levels of health, oppression, and
poverty which weigh them down during the development process.

     In the rural area of Central America, although infant
mortality, general fertility, and the birth rate have declined,
they are still the highest in Latin America, with the most alarming
indexes occurring among the indigenous populations.  With the
exception of Costa Rica, the fertility rate is reported to be from
6 to 8 children per woman, and is clearly linked to the maternal
death rates; the factors usually referred to are unequal
distribution of food in the home, too-short intervals between
pregnancies, premature deliveries, spontaneous abortions, and
adolescent pregnancy. 

     Honduras has identified early pregnancy among adolescents as
an important problem in the health sector, and one of the principal
causes of maternal and child morbidity and mortality.  Guatemala
has identified the loss of adolescence as a serious health problem
among indigenous women who almost immediately go from being girls
to being mothers.

     Delivery in very young women is known to cause irreparable
health damage, as well as limited development, while, in addition,
maternal death rates among the young significantly exceed those of
adult women.  Guatemala reports 50% higher mortality in the
indigenous population than in the nonindigenous one, while Costa
Rica reports differences in morbidity between the indigenous as
opposed to the rest of the population, with a prevalence of
infectious and parasitic diseases found in the indigenous groups
(Garro, 1991:6).  Specific studies carried out among indigenous
peoples in this country have shown that the health status of the
indigenous populations is very precarious, and that they show
behaviors that the rest of the population gave up two decades ago.

     Central American women exhibit greater longevity than men in
all age strata, but they suffer from greater morbidity during all
periods of their lives.  Life expectancy at birth ranges from a
maximum of 70 years for Costa Rican women, to a minimum of 55 years
in Honduras, Nicaragua, and Guatemala (Inter-American Commission
on Women, 1985).

     Sepsis, hemorrhage at delivery, and toxemia of pregnancy are
the second and third causes of death among women from the ages of
15 to 44 years.  Cervical cancer is the leading cause of death for
those between the ages of 45 and 64 years (WHO/PAHO, 1988), with
the most critical situation occurring in the indigenous areas.

     Because of environmental conditions such as an absence of
piped-in water, poor disposal of excreta and wastes, a limited food
supply and poor food distribution in the home, indigenous women
tend to present higher rates of undernutrition, anemia, and
mortality from infectious diseases than the rest of Central
American women.

     Undernutrition, which affects the majority of indigenous
women, becomes more critical during pregnancy and lactation, and
in Guatemala, for example, the assessment of women's health which
was prepared by the National Office on Women with the support of
UNICEF reported that approximately 30% of pregnant women suffer
some degree of nutritional anemia caused by iron deficiency.
 
     The statistical reports on morbidity in women are closely
linked to the reproductive process and don't ever take ethnic
characteristics into account.  The official health systems view
women only in terms of their role as mothers, and not as subjects
with any right to special treatment as persons.

     Within ethnic groups, the system of popular conceptions of
disease provides psychological, social, and technical control; it
provides security in the face of uncertainty.  It is troubling to
be faced with an indefinite future.  Consequently, we humans
attempt to influence events, to anticipate them, to predict them
in ways that are specific to our culture.  In this way, popular
beliefs provide a group with security, while at the same time
establishing controls that discourage any deviation from the norm;
in other words, these beliefs get people to behave in a certain way
(Ghidinelli, GI, 1981:2).

     The scientific literature available on work and medical
knowledge in the pre-Columbian indigenous population has
demonstrated the complex patterns involved, and this is also shown
in the diversity of medical specializations.  When one considers
that these medical practices have been consolidated over some
thousands of years of civilization, it is possible to believe a
priori that they are effective, or at least partially so.  However,
there is no scarcity of literature blaming traditional medical
practices, totally or in part, for the high morbidity and mortality
in the indigenous areas.  These practices constitute
"superstitions," and the fact that they include magical rites seems
to many sufficient cause for denying that they have any scientific
validity.

     However, there has not been enough consideration of the
problems created by the acculturation process, through which
aspects of the most traditional practices are forgotten or only
partially recalled; these leftover bits of knowledge in the medical
field are the source of various dysfunctions, and result from the
fact that the traditional practices are not always transmitted
meticulously, with the entire rational scheme appropriate to the
case.

     Not only is there an impoverishment of the traditional
patterns, but the new patterns are not always understood and
assimilated correctly.

     The acculturation process has acted in such a way as to cause
the techniques and meaning of some therapeutic practices to be
forgotten; as a result, intervention ceases to be curative, and can
even be harmful to the patient's health.  One example of the loss
of ancestral health knowledge has to do with diarrhea:  the custom
of rehydrating children has been given up in favor of seeking above
all to make the diarrhea disappear, which means that the people are
using antibiotics and other drugs indicated by nonmedical
personnel.

     The Ministries of Health, with the support of UNICEF, have
been making extensive efforts to reestablish the practice of oral
rehydration, although they have not used an approach which permits
adequate communication between Western languages and the
traditional indigenous ones.  This language gap is one factor that
creates the high indexes of mortality that are striking these
populations.  At the level of public administration, the entire
state apparatus is not only insufficient, but not accepted by the
population due to the culture shock produced in different cultures. 
In addition, women receive care only in relation to the mother-
child relationship.  There are some private indigenous development
organizations which are working in some areas of the subregion and
these, if they receive support in the form of some organizational
and technical training, could be more operational, taking advantage
of the local initiatives and above all refraining from offending
against the most essential aspects of the traditional cultures. 
There is no lack of programs that work against the cultures of the
indigenous population and seek to impose so-called "development"
plans which do not respond to the needs of these people, which have
not been presented for consultation or approval by them, which are
prepared exclusively according to the whim of the authors, and
which view these people only as objects, because they are seen as
creatures who are impotent, ignorant, and savage. 

     In the subregion there are cultures that can be differentiated
by their social structure, attitudes, practices, and beliefs which
should be considered in the national projects.  Here we are only
presenting two systems of indigenous civilization among the ethnic
groups selected for the project:  the Mesoamerican and the
Macrochibcha.  In the subregion, the Mesoamerican system includes
the Maya of Guatemala, Belize and Honduras, and the Lenca in the
latter country.  They are characterized by the fact that corn is
the axis of their traditional culture and the fact that they are
patrilocal.  The Macrochibcha system of civilization is
characterized by its focus on the cultivation of tubers and its
matrilocal system; it includes the Miskito, the Guaymí, and the
Brunca.

     Guatemala's project will begin among two of the large majority
groups:  the Maya-Quiché and the Maya-Cakchiquel.  The Totonicapán
area, where the Quiché ethnic group predominates and serious
socioeconomic indexes have been noted, will be the principal axis
for the initial work, using the new health care models that were
envisaged in the national project.

     These details have implications above all for the traditional
gender relationships whose structure is the end product of
thousands of years of civilization, although these relationships
currently are in a state of serious imbalance due to the negative
effects of the acculturation process.

     In the traditional indigenous communities the economic
activities of the domestic unit can be divided into three
categories:  a) biological reproduction, i.e. all activities
directed toward producing and maintaining descendants; b) daily
reproduction, or activities aimed at maintaining the work force: 
feeding, water transport, household management, personal care,
clothing, and health.  An important part of this is the
transmission of culture to children from the time they are a few
months old; c) economic activities in the domestic sphere, such as
traditionally female handicrafts and, in some cultures, selling in
the market as well.  Men's work goes on outside the domestic
setting, lasts for a few hours, and is very demanding or dangerous. 
The spheres of male and female work are complementary although they
are totally different.  In the traditional societies, the nuclear
families that are integrated into the ecosystem appear stable.

     To the extent that the environment is degraded and economic
conditions are changed by an expansion in Western-style production,
a change is produced in the reproductive process of the family
group.  Traditional values and family stability become vulnerable. 
Men cease to have total responsibility for supporting their family
members and the women, who performed complementary economic tasks,
assume an active economic role and take on more responsibilities
than before.  Not much is known about the types of adaptations that
the indigenous family has made or is making in the process of
absorbing these changes in the material sphere, or about how women
are taking on and exercising their new role, or about how this is
affecting health.  It is clear, however, that all members of the
family are being groomed for participation in the labor market, and
this includes girls who, from the time they are small, are guided
toward supporting their mothers through caring for the younger
children and the house.

     Women's attitude toward life with regard to their income-
producing activities, the domestic arrangements they must make
within the family in order to maximize the limited resources
available, the ways they organize space and time in order to meet
family needs, and the arrangements they make for the socialization
process at the family and community level in support of daily
activities calls for grinding effort which, if it is not offset at
the physical and emotional level, creates serious health
imbalances.  The high levels of alcoholism found among male Miskito
and Guaymí, with a smaller incidence among the Mayan groups,
aggravates the health picture for women, increasing still more the
workload and responsibilities that women must assume in order to
sustain their families both spiritually and materially.  Such
pressure opens women up to physical and mental deterioration, but
in the field of mental health there is a complete lack of
information about the current situation of women; cases of
psychological abuse are not reported until they are irreversible.

     Contact between indigenous men and mestizo society--which
preserves the patriarchal characteristics of its colonial origins,
in which "machismo"  is an essential component and results in
paternal irresponsibility--affects the stability and conjugal
relations of indigenous homes.  Machismo is a characteristic
feature of the mestizo male culture.  The male is a "true" man who
can be identified with the bull, a mythic animal which is the
source of life and wealth in a society of livestock owners.  The
genuinely macho man should have the attributes of a bull:  a large
penis, the psychological and physical capacity to sleep with a lot
of women in a short time, fertility for procreation, combativeness,
and fearlessness in the face of danger.  Almost all women are
fertile territory for these males to prove themselves.  The vast
majority of men with sufficient economic means have several women,
and various out-of-wedlock children with them, and this is
something they boast about, although there are no official figures
to illustrate this phenomenon.  Women are forced to adapt to all
this because their role in society is a dependent one (Ghidinelli,
1976: 169).


3. THE PROJECT

     The project on "Health and Development of Indigenous Women,"
whose planning and rationale is summarized in the previous
sections, seeks to strengthen the role of indigenous women in the
Region as multiplier agents for change who make it possible to
develop, within the official health systems, alternative models for
health services and health care which are aimed at the female
population of their own cultural groups.

     In this sense, the target population of the project is
represented in the first instance by all the women who belong to
the Maya-Quiché, Maya-Cakchiquel, Miskito, and Guaymí ethnic
groups, as the principal users, promoters, and providers of health
care.  Collaterally, indigenous families will be the indirect
beneficiaries of the project as they receive the health and
educational practices that the women transmit in the area of
health, as multipliers who are responsible for implementing
measures for disease prevention, hygiene, nutrition, and care of
children.

     The project is based on the idea that ethnic groups encompass
a cultural base and a system of ideas about health and disease that
need to be made clear and preserved as a means of democratizing and
cutting down on costs in the health services in the subregion, from
a perspective based on respect and communication when the different
cultures interact. 

     In separating out gender, an attempt is being made to see that
the project components effectively address women's problems, at the
same time fostering a process of gender-based individuation that
opens the doors to a clarification and redefinition of women's
identity which is based on their cultural roots.  This is to be
done in such a way that the project becomes an innovative element
that can be imitated by other programs and projects that identify
women only according to the perspective of their relational
identity, referring to the status they derive from their kinship
ties, principally with the male members of their primary group.

     The institutional personnel of the Ministries of Health,
especially those working in the project areas, will have a major
responsibility for becoming involved in the project through an
intensive training phase that will allow them to adapt to all the
demands of implementing the services envisioned in the new health
care models. 

     The ethnic groups mentioned were selected based on
demographic, health, and geographic considerations.  From a
demographic perspective, the groups chosen had the largest
concentrations of people.  Of an approximate figure of 6,308,060
for the indigenous population of the subregion, the project would
encompass four ethnic groups, or 24% of the total. Based on a
hypothetical ratio between men and women, the total number of women
selected would be as follows:

Mayan Groups:
Quiché           462,500
Cakchiquel       202,500
Miskito           67,500
Guaymí            32,913
-----------
Grand total      765,413

     From the perspective of health, using the four largest groups
facilitates the design and application of innovative strategies
that impact on a greater number of persons.

     Geographically, the physical-territorial location of these
ethnic groups ties together the entire subregion.  The Miskito are
found in Honduras and Nicaragua; the Guaymí in Costa Rica and
Panama; and the Maya in Guatemala, Belize, and Honduras.  For this
reason the project is presented with a regional perspective,
according to which the activities of the Ministry of Health in each
country with regard to the chosen population groups should be
closely linked to the PAHO national offices, with flexible
coordination at the subregional level from a headquarters in
Guatemala, since that country features a population which is 50%
indigenous. 

3.1. GENERAL OBJECTIVES

     Taking into consideration that the authorized Western-style
health system is neither in harmony with nor meets the needs of the
local indigenous community systems, and that this phenomenon has
its worst effect on women, whether because of their decided
monolingualism, their level of illiteracy, or sex discrimination,
this project seeks to establish the bases for transforming this
situation by adapting the health systems so that they reflect the
ethnic, socioeconomic, and gender-related features and diversity
of the population.

     The project's general objectives are:

*    To increase both qualitatively and quantitatively the
     participation of the indigenous population, particularly
     women, in official and non-official health programs, and
     especially to remove the socioeconomic, ethnic, and gender-
     related barriers that prevent women from actively
     participating in the projects and programs.

*    To facilitate a multiplier effect in the project, so that it
     can be technically and easily adapted by other ethnic
     communities in the subregion.

3.2. SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES

     1.   To initiate the activities aimed at establishing the
bases for the project to enter its execution phase with
an adequate and efficient organizational proposal.

     2.   To learn about the gender relationships within the ethnic
groups and, based on these, to be able to individualize
the women's role and the activities that need to be
carried out so that their integration into the project
meets their own personal needs and those of the group.

     3.   To support the Central American indigenous women who are
seeking to improve the health and living conditions of
their communities based on their own cultures.

     4.   To gain a precise and clear knowledge of the factors that
facilitate or inhibit satisfactory relationships between
the official and the traditional health systems.

     5.   To formulate alternative models of care that are accepted
by the population and to present them to the official
health systems or to alternative organizations for use
in the project areas. 

     6.   To sensitize and train the official health personnel and
to implement alternative health care models that are
suitable for, desired by, and functional for the
population in question.

     7.   To train a specific number of indigenous women so that
they can become strengthening agents for the project
objectives. 

     8.   To facilitate a large-scale experiment in the collective
organization of women around this health project, so that
such organizations can become appropriate channels for
the planning and execution of activities for production,
assessment, and self-esteem. 

3.3  PROJECT COMPONENTS 

     The project consists of three components:

     a) Research
     b) Training and organization
     c) Health care models 

     3.3.1 Research.

     As a fundamental part of the project, the research component
     is considered basic to achieving the proposed objectives.  It
     is felt that in this subcomponent, various techniques can be
     utilized, depending on the desired scope and degree of
     complexity.  In all possible cases, it will be attempted to
     use participatory research as part of a strategy whose aim is
     to involve the community in learning about and solving their
     own problems.  Unquestionably, the variants of this
     methodology--action-oriented research, self-study, and self-
     assessment--will be used to fuse together the participation
     of the technicians and the population during the different
     phases of the research process.

     The research component will seek to provide the basic tools
     for:

     a)   Learning about the gender relationships that occur in the
traditional ethnic groups and during the acculturation
process, as a means of individually breaking down the
problems that arise from these relationships.

     b)   Learning about the types of ethnomedical specializations
that are found in these communities, and about how the
men or women who are specialists (traditional health
workers, or THWs) obtain their knowledge.

     c)   Learning about the idea system employed by the THWs with
respect to the workings of the female body, the diseases
specific to women, and the types of ethnotherapy used. 

     d)   Learning about the networks that are derived from such
knowledge, especially in the woman-world and woman-man
binomials.

     e)   Learning about the types of popular ethnotherapeutic
practices and common procedures that are used in
diagnosis and therapy for the diseases that afflict women
as subjects and in their referential relationships.

     f)   Learning about the popular therapeutic practices in the
area of maternal and child health, including the popular
dietary practices of mothers whose children present
diarrhea symptoms and the common procedures for
diagnosing disease.

     g)   Learning about the therapeutic practices utilized by the
THWs, including the specific steps of a cure as well as
the medicines used, and showing how Western medicine
would cure the patient and how the two therapeutic
methods could be combined. 

     h)   Identifying the positive and negative factors that
influence the work carried out by the THWs from the
perspective of gender.

     i)   Showing which traditional practices are useful and which
are not, for the purpose of assessing endogenous
therapeutic resources. 

     j)   Showing the relationships that exist between the
acculturation process and the problems of gender and
mental health.

     k)   Analyzing the medical practices utilized by hospitals and
health posts to be able to enter into concrete-
operational areas as a means of understanding how Western
medicine is used.

     l)   Learning about and describing health systems that are
found to be able to use the natural resources in a
locality as the raw material for the therapeutic process,
and using this information as a basis for facilitating
policies aimed at reducing the high costs of importing
drugs.

     3.3.2 Training and Organization.

     The training component is designed to give a satisfactory
     response to the needs of the women and the communities
     selected.  This component envisages three ty
