n of information, observation visits, and other activities
may eventually extend to neighboring countries, provided there are
no deterrents and that funds can be obtained from other sources.

        In all the countries included above there is special interest at the central,
        regional, and local level in launching activities to provide comprehensive
        health care for adolescents.  There are also resources at the local,
        regional (in the case of Brazil), and even national (in Costa Rica) levels
        with valuable experience that can serve as examples to other areas within
        their own countries, as well as to other countries.  It should also be
        emphasized that interaction is expected within each of the networks and
        between them.  At the least, the following types of activities can be carried
        out:

-   Activities in every focal country with support from the reference
centers.

-   Activities that involve the entire focal network and the network
of support or reference centers (see Figure 1).

        f) The central point of action in the focal countries might be a center
for the care of adolescents that occupies a leadership position in the
national context, preferably a university that has ties with the health
services and communities, or some other prestigious national,
regional, or local entity, such as the adolescent health commission or
committee of a pediatrics society.  In each of the focal countries the
plan of action should lay the foundation for a gradually expanding
network of centers and programs which will eventually become an
important resource for national initiatives or programs that provide
comprehensive health care for adolescents.

As Figure 1 shows, an attempt has been made to represent the various
subregions:  Central America and the Caribbean, the Andean countries, Brazil, and
the Southern Cone.  This approach will facilitate concomitant and successive
expansion of the results within and between countries, as well as the implementation
of activities at the subregional and Regional levels as part of the regular functions of
international cooperation of the Pan American Health Organization.  At the same
time, it is hoped that the efforts made at the level of selected countries will help to
strengthen the impact of the local projects for adolescent health and development
being sponsored by the Kellogg Foundation in Latin America and the Caribbean.


B.   PLAN OF ACTIVITIES

     In order to implement the Plan of Work, the following four components are
considered essential:

     1.  Development of ways to equip the health services to provide
comprehensive health care for adolescents.

     2.  Design and execution of a human resources development plan to
facilitate the teaching and delivery of comprehensive health care for
adolescents.

     3.  Strengthening of the Regional networks of institutions committed to
working with adolescents.

     4.  Support to develop operating capacity for execution of the Project.

     The first three components coincide with the three General Objectives
described above.  The last is aimed at strengthening PAHO's structural and
functional capabilities for the execution of the Project.  It should be emphasized that
the four components cannot be considered separately since they are complementary
parts of a whole.

     Listed below are the activities to be carried out under each of the foregoing
components:

Component 1:

     Development of ways to equip the health services to provide comprehensive
health care for adolescents.
      
Activities:

1.1. Development of instruments for the evaluation of services at the primary,
     secondary, and tertiary levels of care.

1.2. Development of normative guidelines for programming.

1.3. Support for national processes aimed at the standardization of
     comprehensive health care for adolescents.

1.4  Development of a clinical history model for adolescents that includes the
     instrument, the instructions, computerized management of the data, and the
     analysis thereof.

1.5. Development of an instrument for the identification of dysfunctional
     families.


Component 2:

     Design and execution of a human resources development plan to facilitate
the teaching and delivery of comprehensive health care for adolescents.

Activities:

2.1  Training of trainers for teachers and service personnel (seven three-week
     courses).

2.2  Promotion of intersectoral action in the provision of comprehensive health
     care for adolescents in the countries (seven seminars for professionals from
     various fields).

2.3  Development of participatory techniques for working with adolescents.

2.4  Development of a training module on adolescent health care aimed at
     workers at the primary level.


Component 3:

      Strengthening of the two networks of countries involved in the project.

Activities:

3.1  Promotion and dissemination of publications, standards, and programs
     related to comprehensive health care for adolescents.

3.2  Strengthening and support of three information centers at the country level.

3.3  Organization of three traveling seminars for leaders of local and national
     projects.



Component 4:

      The aim of this component is to promote coordination between local projects
in the countries that comprise each network and between the two networks, as well
as coordination between the local projects in every country and at the Regional and
central levels in order to strengthen the impact of initiatives at the local and
intermediate levels so that they will support national adolescent health initiatives.

Activities:

4.1  An initial planning meeting with the focal points in every country.

4.2  Four meetings of the Scientific Technical Advisory Committee.

4.3  Two trips by a PAHO official to provide supervision and support for the
     country networks.

     Other HPM Program activities related to comprehensive health care for
adolescents.



OTHER ACTIVITIES


     In addition to the activities under the project described above, the Regional
Maternal and Child Health Program, through the Adolescent Health Unit and the
Units for Women and Children, will continue to carry out basic technical
cooperation activities with the countries of the Region in already existing areas.

a)   Mobilization of resources both within PAHO and with other agencies,
     particularly UNFPA, UNICEF, WHO, and NGOs (Carnegie Corporation,
     Pew Charitable Trust, IYF, and others).  Mobilization of scientific
     associations in the countries, subregions, and Region as strategic
     instruments or mechanisms for the implementation of new initiatives and for
     the strengthening of programs at the national, subregional, and Regional
     level.

b)   The distribution of scientific and educational material to institutions in the
     countries will also be a priority. 

c)   Direct technical assistance to the countries--especially in the development of
     plans and programs through PAHO/WHO resources and short-term
     consultants--will continue to be provided to the extent possible.  Technical
     resources in the countries will continue to be mobilized to support other
     countries.

d)   Support for health services research, including operational, epidemiological,
     and evaluative aspects, will also be continued. 

e)   The inclusion of topics relating to adolescence will be gradually
     incorporated into courses sponsored by the Program in the areas of maternal
     and child health and management at both the international and national
     levels.



COUNTERPARTS   



      At the international level, technical-financial participation will be sought
from the Kellogg Foundation, UNFPA, AID, the International Youth Federation,
the Carnegie Corporation, and the Pew Charitable Trust, among others.

     The Global Program on Adolescent Health (WHO) will continue to support
activities aimed at methodological development, research, and technical support. 

     There will be continued collaboration with ECLAC as the coordinating body
for activities relating to adolescents and youth carried out in the Region by
UNESCO, ILO, CELAJU, CELADE, and UNICEF.

     At the institutional level (PAHO), the Program will be enhanced by the
contributions of technical personnel responsible for accident prevention, prevention
of substance abuse, and mental health.  Activities will be closely coordinated with
the Programs for Health Promotion and Nutrition.

     Within the Program for Maternal and Child Health, there will be continuous
coordination in the areas of human reproduction, growth, and development. 

     At the country level, the consultants in maternal and child health or in
health services will act as focal points for activities relating to adolescent health
carried out in and through the Country Representations.

     An attempt will be made in conjunction with those responsible for programs
on maternal and child health in the countries to determine whether or not the
different countries have the financial, physical, and human resources needed in
order to carry out the activities and achieve the desired results.

Proposal for the Development Public Health Theory and Practice in the
Countries of the Americas


      In late 1989 the Pan American Health Organization entered into an
agreement with the American Association of Schools of Public Health (ASPH)
and the Latin American and Caribbean Association of Public Health Education
(ALAESP) to conduct a joint preliminary assessment of the Region's situation
and trends in the area of public health.  This undertaking was ultimately to
form the basis for a broader proposal for cooperation.  The present project
serves as a corollary to lines of action implemented by a group of technical
programs of PAHO and other institutions during the period 1987-1990 which
made it increasingly apparent that there is need to implement a more
comprehensive approach in the field of health.

      This new initiative of the Organization is an outgrowth of increasing
world awareness that public health is currently in a state of crisis.  In the
face of changing circumstances, most societies are no longer able to promote
and protect their own health.  This initiative draws its justification from
the insufficient progress that has been made by the countries toward the goal
of Health for All by the Year 2000 and at the same time from the new demands
being posed by the socioeconomic situation in the Region, which have made the
aforementioned crisis all the more patent and have underscored the need to
look for fresh alternatives.

      Originally the problem was thought to lie in the schools or in the
public health education process--as was the case, for example, during the
1970s.  However, evidence now places the issue in a far more complex
dimension that also includes the pattern of customary practices and a broad
range of health indicators.

      The fact is that a major portion of the Latin American population--
mostly the socioeconomic groups with the lowest standards of living--is at
excessive risk of illness and death.  This is true for all age groups and for
most health problems, particularly those that should already have been
overcome.  In all the countries, including the most highly developed ones,
there continue to be significant geographical differences in terms of
mortality, morbidity, and access to basic health services, which are even
more marked between the different social groups.

      It has been estimated that more than 130 million people lack regular
access to basic health services.  Moreover, with the growth in population
projected for 1990-2000, this figure is expected to increase by another 100
million.  Thus the health services will have to gear up to meet the needs of
230 million more people in addition to those already being covered while at
the same time improving the quality of the medical care currently provided
and giving increased emphasis to health promotion and protection.

      It is now important to raise political and scientific awareness of the
critical problems and deficiencies in public health and to focus on the
motives and practices that have characterized the situation in the Americas
in order to encourage the formulation of guidelines that will shape the
decisions needed in the medium and long term.  In keeping with processescurrently under way at the global level, the project conceives of public
health not just as a field of professional specialization but, more
importantly, as a duty of the state and, above all, as a commitment of
society to its health ideals.

      The objectives are:  on the one hand, to describe and account for the
situation of public health and its major trends in the Americas within the
context of the new challenges posed by the social situation in general and by
health in particular and, on the other hand, to identify ways of revitalizing
or reorienting the conceptual, methodological, and operational practice of
public health in the countries of the Region, especially through the
promotion of sectoral leadership, research, and advanced training in public
health.


Conceptual and Referential Framework

      Public health is regarded as the means, whether organized or not, by
which society translates into action its commitment to seek the attainment of
its health ideals.  It is recognized that the development of society's fund
of knowledge, attitudes, traditions, beliefs, and practices with regard to
health is causally related to changes in the economic, political, and social
context.  At present, this context in the Region of the Americas is
characterized by profound economic crisis, a growing trend toward
democratization, and increasingly active social participation.

      Even though the health situation differs markedly between subregions,
countries, areas within a single country, and population groups, on the whole
it is characterized by a decline in communicable diseases and a rise in
noncommunicable diseases and damages or risks to the environment as a result
of growing industrialization and urbanization, coupled with an aging
population.  In the health services, the perennial problems remain:  the
programs are largely vertical and fail to provide the infrastructure needed
in order to serve the population and the environment on a comprehensive
basis; coverage is low; emphasis is placed on the curative approach; the
quality of care remains poor; and the services have become progressively less
accessible.  The recent trend toward the privatization of health care is
raising a number of questions and will undoubtedly undermine public services
even further.  Public health education has failed to keep pace with the
social, economic, and political changes that are taking place, which
necessitate a shift to new, more complex theories and practice.  And finally,
in most of the countries there is a sizable gap between theory and practice.

      Against this backdrop, a promising sign has been the attempt to
reorient national health systems by developing and strengthening local health
systems--a Regional political commitment that corresponds to an operational
tactic within the primary health care strategy.  Also encouraging is the
trend toward strategies that include people-oriented intervention, active
health promotion, tapping into multisectoral potential and the potential of
popular wisdom, recognition of the role of the family, and espousal of thevalues inherent in such concepts as health, participation, citizenship,
social control, and others.


Principal Characteristics of the Present Line of Action

      The central focus of analysis, promotion, and development efforts under
the project will be public health theory and practice as expressed through
service, education, and research.  The basic approach will move,
scientifically, from the specific to the general and, geographically, from
the national to the Regional level.

      The analysis component will not only view a cross-section of reality
but will go on to take a longitudinal look, both retrospective and
prospective, at the challenges, processes, and most important actors in the
field of health.  One facet of this analysis will involve a study of the
political, scientific, technical, and operational changes that have taken
place, while another will look at the repercussions these transformations
have had on the social processes of service, education, and research.  In
this way it should be possible to examine--or anticipate--the interaction
over time between specific problems or ideals, on the one hand, and, on the
other, specific actions or programs.

      Information will be gathered from a number of sources (individuals,
institutions, studies, publications) at the national, subregional, and
Regional level.  The counterparts for the different components of the present
project may be either national (Ministries of Health, Social Security
institutions, universities, research institutions) or international (for
example, Economic Commission for Latin America, World Bank, Inter-American
Development Bank, Kellogg Foundation, U.S. Centers for Disease Control,
etc.).  The focal points may be persons, groups, or institutions.


Expected Outcomes and Actions

      As already indicated, the description and assessment of the situation
and trends in public health theory and practice that will emerge from the
present proposal are expected to serve as a basis for the promotion and,
hopefully, the generation of a movement aimed at the formulation and adoption
of policy guidelines or directives for social action in this area in the
Region of the Americas.

      The following outcomes and actions are expected in the medium term:

      1.  Initial reflection (individual and collective contributions). 
      Implementation of the present proposal will lead to the consolidation
      of previous PAHO work in this area and also to requests for
      contributions from selected experts.  These contributions, taken as a
      whole, should represent the various views of public health theory and
      practice in the Region.  On this basis, an attempt will be made to puttogether a collective picture.  All the contributions will be widely
      disseminated in the hope of generating extensive discussion on public
      health theory and practice in the Region.

      2.  Fostering of critical awareness (national and subregional
      meetings).  As an essential part of the process, group discussion and
      reflection will be promoted in selected countries or subregions in
      order to encourage the development of specific areas.  The areas
      identified for action will constitute important reference points for
      the channeling of PAHO technical cooperation.

      3.  As a line of research, partial description and analysis of the
      development of public health.  Based on a document or proposed plan
      outlining the corresponding objectives, categories of analysis,
      variables, areas of study, and methods, national or subregional studies
      will be promoted to ascertain the size and sociocultural
      characteristics of the populations as well as the availability of
      critical information.

      4.  Dissemination of conceptual, methodological, and operational
      materials (publications).  These will include reports written by
      experts on experiences to date, institutional accounts, and summaries
      of meetings and studies planned or carried out in the course of the
      project.

      5.  Regional guidelines for the reorientation of public health
      (Region-wide scientific meeting).  Presentations requested from
      institutions, groups, or invited experts will be discussed and analyzed
      in a major scientific conference.  The basic documents, conclusions,
      and recommendations from this meeting will be widely distributed with a
      view to stimulating concrete action at the country level.

      6.  Creation of political momentum (caucus).  A group of leaders in
      education and service from the northern and southern parts of the
      Hemisphere will analyze a document on the public health situation and
      formulate a series of conclusions and recommendations for future
      development.  The recommendations will take the form of a declaration
      or manifesto that will be widely disseminated.

      7.  Theoretical, methodological, and operational development
      (development networks).  An effort will be made to set up development
      nuclei in institutions or consortiums of institutions wherever
      political, technical, and operational conditions are such that they
      will permit selective progress in the review of difficulties
      encountered or progress made toward filling the gaps identified during
      the process.  Formation of an informal network will be encouraged in
      order to facilitate the exchange of theoretical, methodological, and
      instrumental information and to help ensure that the knowledge or
      technologies generated are applied to the specific institutional and
      social reality in each country.


Tentative Timetable

      The proposal is intended to be implemented at three levels:  conceptual
and referential, with emphasis on understanding the problem; methodological,
with emphasis on development; and operational, with emphasis on application
and development.  These levels comprise the various activities either under
way or planned, as described below.

      During the last quarter of 1990, a series of reference documents were
prepared offering different perspectives on the basic values and determinants
of public health theory and practice in the Region.  These documents* were
distributed to selected experts for review, and their comments or reactions
were consolidated and presented at a meeting held in New Orleans, Louisiana,
on 21-24 October 1991.  This event was sponsored by the Latin American and
Caribbean Association for Public Health Education and the American
Association of Schools of Public Health with the support of PAHO and
participation by the authors of the respective documents.

      The participants concluded that public health is currently in a state
of profound crisis and that it is suffering from the following deficiencies:

      - Inability to meet the needs of society.  Fundamentally, the crisis
      lies in the discrepancy between theory and practice--in other words,
      the inability to use the knowledge that is produced in ways that will
      influence the social situation.  But the crisis is more far-reaching
      than this:  there is also a need to rethink theory and practice from
      the ground up.

      - Inadequacy of current explanatory models.  Public health is focused
      on the concept of disease.  To get beyond this point will involve
      redefining its basic concepts, redefining the field of knowledge, and
      rethinking the theory in terms of disciplines that provide explanatory
      models drawn from the social sciences.

      - Limitation of public health practice to patient care, with little
      concern for the prevention of disease.  This reduces the health sector
      to a network of medical and public health services and the management
      of these services.  Public health is not in a position to take
      advantage of the opportunity for reconstruction that civilian society
      is currently offering through organizations that are looking for new
      ways to cope with disease, especially in the face of government
      cutbacks in the provision of basic services.  The rethinking of public
      health practice will involve redefining such basic concepts as society,
      state, sector, and population, as well as mounting actions aimed at
      building widespread consciousness based on social control in response
      to the privatization of health care and advocating a form of government
      that will foster the democratization of power, participation by the
      people, and due regard for social movements.

     The participants also looked closely at trends in public health theory
and practice with a view to suggesting modifications and proposing new
strategies.

      The group discussed the continuity of this initiative, pointing out,
with respect to analysis, the importance of multicenter projects that will
allow greater in-depth study of the determinants of the public health crisis
and, in regard to promotion, the need to influence the grass-roots level and
to expand debate in technical, scientific, and political circles as well as
within the entities or institutions involved.

      The foregoing individual and collective contributions will add a great
deal to subregional and national discussion, which in turn will serve as a
basis for determining the work that needs to be done in the areas of service,
research, and education and for preparing a proposal (development plan) for
the corresponding studies.  These activities will receive technical and
financial support from PAHO.  The meetings and research that are planned for
1992-1993 will require the mobilization of special funds.  It is expected
that in 1992 a workshop for the promotion of research projects will generate
proposals for consideration by the PAHO/WHO Research Grants Program.

      One of the medium-term goals is to hold a Region-wide conference on the
subject, tentatively scheduled for late 1994, which will include progress
reports on the foregoing activities as well as the national and subregional
studies.  The political caucus is expected to be held in 1995.  The financing
of these activities will require considerable external resources in addition
to special PAHO funds.

      Further activities relating to theoretical and practical development,
aimed at achieving the fundamental objective of the project, will be
programmed later on, as theoretical, methodological, and operational gaps are
detected and potential development centers are identified.







FOREWORD


      For the second time in the recent history of the Pan American Health
Organization, the Member Governments have established lines for institutional
action over a four-year period and laid down the axes that should lead to the
transformation of national health systems.

      This collective exercise in strategic planning takes on particular
significance in light of the far-reaching and overwhelming changes that are
taking place in the world, which give a new dimension to the regional
scenarios in which the work of the sector is carried out.

      The two documents in this volume, the first presenting the Strategic
Orientations and Program Priorities for the Pan American Health Organization
during the Quadrennium 1991-1994 and the second setting forth the criteria
for their implementation, were approved by the Organization's Governing
Bodies in September 1990 and in June 1991, respectively.

      Together, these documents provide the doctrinal framework and the
instrumental approaches that the Member Governments have agreed upon as the
fundamental outline for the task of the sector in the present quadrennium.

      In publishing these basic orientations for the quadrennium, the
Organization is giving broad dissemination to the mandate of its Governing
Bodies and hopes to contribute to the efficiency, effectiveness, and progress
of national programs and to the consolidation of health as the fundamental
pillar of social development in the Hemisphere.

FINAL REPORT

        Conceptual Aspects of Local Strategic Administration (LSA)



Chairman:   Dr. Hugo Salinas
Rapporteur: Dr. Douglas Soza


        The Regional Seminar on Strategic Planning in Local Health Systems
was held in Santiago, Chile, on 7-11 October 1991.  The meeting was opened
by the acting Minister of Health, Dr. Patricio Silva, and Dr. Gustavo Mora,
PAHO/WHO Representative in Chile, speaking for the director of the Pan
American Organization and in the name of the World Health Organization. 
The inaugural addresses were followed by a roundtable discussion on
strategic planning which provided background for the subsequent debate.  In
the afternoon, the preliminary version of the basic LSA document was
presented, following which the meeting broke into groups to discuss aspects
of LSA.  On the morning of 10 October a plenary session was held in order
to discuss reports on the following topics:

a) Social Participation and Local Strategic Administration (LSA)

b) Health, Development, and the Intersectoral Approach

c) Management and Information Systems

d) Programs and the Identification of Health Problems

        Social participation in health calls for the establishment and
institutionalization of channels of participation, coupled with mechanisms
that will ensure that decisions taken at the local or regional level will
have an impact on political decision-making at the central level.  Also, it
is of the utmost importance to examine the role of health workers as social
actors.  Our Ministries of Health have bureaucratic and excessively
hierarchical structures and operating procedures and are not very open to
accepting and adopting political decisions that are generated at the local
level.  Their structure needs to be recast in a democratic framework.  At
the same time, social movements are gaining momentum and new actors are
emerging, including the nongovernmental organizations (NGOs).  Social
participation and local health systems should be seen as mechanisms that
will lead to the strengthening of health systems.

        This situation, however, should not lead us to the mistaken
position of opting for a civilian society that is is pitted against the
State, since in the current Latin American context the State is probably
the only real mechanism available to protect the poor.  Hence the State has
the obligation to facilitate coordination between agents and institutions
that defend the unprotected, to guarantee equity and access, to promote the
practice of democracy.

        At the theoretical level, the intersectoral approach is recognized
in all areas of the health sector, but everyday practice is at odds with
theory.  The intersectoral approach offers extraordinary potential at the
local level, the context in which it is best facilitated, since the
health-development equation finds its concrete expression in actors who are
known to all and where the relationship between the intersectoral approach
and social participation is not constrained by exacting limitations.  In
any case, it should be made clear that reaffirmation of the concept does
not preclude intersectoral articulation at the other levels but in fact
reinforces the need there as well.  With regard to the characteristics that
are essential for intersectoral articulation at the local level, the
following should be pointed out:

      a) The local political authority should be the axis and the local
conductor of the intersectoral approach.

      b) For this to happen, it is essential that there be a truly
effective process of decentralization.


      c) The fundamental mechanism of intersectoral articulation should be
consensus.

      d) There is need to formulate a policy on mass communication for the
promotion of local health system development.

      e) Decentralization and the intersectoral approach should be
developed as mechanisms to facilitate assigning priorities to
problems and taking decisions that will have an impact.

      Programs, as a rational ordering of knowledge, resources,
activities, and dates, make it possible for local health systems to adhere
to the principles of efficiency, effectiveness, quality, and equity. 
Knowledge expressed in the form of skills and technologies is an important
element in identifying problems.  The democratization of knowledge is an
indispensable requirement.

      The strategy of health promotion, which was emphasized by the XXIII
Pan American Sanitary Conference (1990), strengthens and facilitates the
processes of social participation, intersectoral initiative, and assumption
of responsibility by each and every member of society for the true
development of health as a valuable resource for all.  The local health
system managers should focus on implementing mechanisms that will lead to
concrete action in the area of health promotion.

      In the identification and study of problems, the unit of analysis is
the social group.  Programs should start from the needs of the entire
population and act according to the criterion of equity, thus gaining
legitimacy in the context of participation.

      Knowledge of reality is not enough to enable the health sector to
identify problems and formulate responses; the concept of local health
system implies an intersectoral view of the phenomenon--one that is
comprehensive and quite distinct from the process of planning and
programming.

      Standards and programs will continue to exist and will be developed
at every level.  They should be sufficiently flexible to avoid conflicts
and duplication and at the same time be able to meet the needs.



      Effective and efficient operation of the services, within a process
of local integration that not only responds to the demand for care but also
includes prevention and health promotion, continues to be very important.

      In order to create a setting in which management is based on the
perception of health as a social value, it will be necessary to recast the
sector and redefine its leadership, since health is not now its heritage.

      The complex, pluralistic, and uncertain environment in which LSA
takes place calls for systems, instruments, and personal capacity that will
make it possible to negotiate a consensus among a variety of autonomous
actors and interests.  It is fundamental that the managerial function
inhere in a setting that has the capacity to assume leadership, forge
consensus, and negotiate in areas such as decision-making and the
mobilization of intra and resources intersectoral and that is able to give
direction to the process.

      In order for management to be able to take a strategic approach and
have the necessary autonomy to operate, it is essential to develop
DECENTRALIZATION.  This, in turn, requires:  a political commitment to the
principle, the necessary legal instruments, and instruments provided by the
central level to make it operational and effective.  Decentralization
should be compatible with the regulatory role that corresponds to the
central level, which guarantees coordination with national policies and
makes it possible to maintain a systemic approach throughout the health
sector.

      Strategic administration requires knowledge of the epidemiological
reality, development of local diagnoses that make it possible to measure
the degree to which services are meeting the needs of the population, and
tools that are sufficiently sensitive to identify expectations and needs.

      The legal framework that supports the local health system must be
flexible enough to allow for decision-making and action that will
facilitate strategic administration, especially in the discretional areas
of resource management.

     The managerial approach should be aimed at replacing supervision/
control with a more advisory-type supervision at both the local and the
central level.

      Training, in addition to being a strategy, is also an area which in
itself needs to be transformed so that it is seen as an overall context and
as an ongoing process rather than an end in itself, with special emphasis
on in-service training.

      Analysis of the current status of information systems indicates that
for the most part the systems are producing information that is out of
date, insufficient, unreliable, and non-participatory, because they are
organized vertically and directed from the central level, failing to
reflect the needs of those directly involved in the process.  Average
national indicators conceal local differences and are of little use at the
grass-roots level.

      An information system for local strategic administration should be
generated and analyzed by the protagonists at the local level while at the
same time providing the information needed at the central level.  It should
also provide useful and timely information for local management in terms of
indicators that are fully sensitive to the problems of the particular
community and also serve as an instrument that enables corrective measures
to be adopted.

      The information produced should be expressed into simple terms that
can be easily understood by the community, which should be kept regularly
informed about important aspects of the health situation and about
resources being used via whatever media my be available, starting with
those forms that require simpler, more easily resolvable data in smaller
amounts.

      After the reports were read, the group as a whole proceeded to
discuss them, making the contributions and modifications that are
summarized below.

      It was pointed out that health, independently of how it is
perceived, it is a political fact that must be taken into consideration in
the implementation and development of local health systems.  Consequently,
it is important that political and religious organizations participate as
intermediaries between civilian society and the State, facilitating the
necessary processes of negotiation and consensus.

      Another aspect that was considered in the discussion was financing,
it being pointed out that even when local health systems already have funds
allocated to them locally, it is desirable for the participating
institutions to press for a reorganization of existing resources in their
specific territory and population.

      Several ways of approaching this problem were mentioned:

1.   Financing should not be regarded merely as the acquisition of more
      resources; instead, the concept should be expanded to include the
      best utilization of installed capacity.

2.    Consideration should be given not just to traditional resources but
      also to other types that may help to solve the problems identified.

3.    The allocation of budgetary and financial resources should take into
      account the territory, the population, the basic needs that are not
      being met, the level of poverty, and other considerations.

      Another aspect discussed was programs and the identification of
health problems.  The former, it was pointed out, are mainly being framed
in terms of damages to health and age groups.  With respect to the latter,
the necessary epidemiological and social analysis has yet to be carried
out.  One way of overcoming these deficiencies would be through integration
into the local setting, changing the traditional disease-oriented approach
to a view in which health is seen as the object of its own action.

      Finally, attention was called to the way in which the document
"Local Strategic Administration," presented at the meeting, creates a false
dichotomy between normative and strategic approaches to planning, which the
meeting felt were necessarily complementary.

        The presentations were given on the afternoons of Tuesday, 
Wednesday, and Thursday, 8-10 October, in four simultaneous breakout
sessions.  For the group that met in Room A the moderator was Dr. Jorge
Mandl and the rapporteur, Dr. Fernando Sacoto.  Dr. María Emilia M. de León
and Dr. Carlos Matamala had the respective tasks of moderator and rapporter
for Group B, Drs. Carlos Morales and Horacio Pracilio for Group C, and Drs.
Fernando Muñoz and José M. Cárdenas, respectively, for Group D.

        One of the countries presented 14 cases, another country presented
three, three of the countries presented two, and the rest of countries
presented one each.  PAHO presented three cases.

        The reports highlighted aspects relating to the development of
local health systems such as the application of strategic approaches to the
methodological development of local administration and programming;
management information systems; social participation; legal and
administrative instruments for decentralization and municipalization;
curricula and strategies for the training of health teams; methodological
approaches to the execution of specific programs; experiences in the
strengthening of programs on women, health, and development; methods and
instruments for the management of epidemics at the local level (e.g.
cholera); and natural disasters.


I.  Aspects Relating to the Service Infrastructure

        This section covers those presentations that focused on the
strengthening of health systems through application of the local health
system strategy.

A.  Application of Strategic Approaches to Local Administration and
Programming

        With regard to the application of strategic approaches to local
administration and programming, some of the presentations emphasized the
need to make provision for achieving equity, effectiveness, and efficiency
in the delivery of health services to the population.  The reports on the
different experiences brought out the importance of reorienting policies so
that they will encourage the application of strategic approaches.  One of
the reports traced the development of guidelines for the implementation of
a national health plan that called for local programming as its operational
instrument.



        The instruments presented were aimed at developing new primary
care models and recasting health systems to give more emphasis to local
systems, and their basic elements included the application of new
epidemiological approaches, the development of the managerial capacity,
decentralization, and social participation.  Another instrument consisted
of a simulation model to aid the health system administrator and facilitate
the programming of activities for specific time periods.

        One of the presentations reported on the preparation and execution
of an overall strategic plan for health services development which
incorporated political, economic, social, demographic, and health aspects
with a view to upgrading and modernizing the management of these services.

        Another report described the operational organization of a local
health system at the municipal level, in which a management model was
established for the development of comprehensive health care, along with
mechanisms for seeing that health plans are incorporated into comprehensive
plans for municipal development and that local, regional, and national
resources are enlisted.

        Finally, there was a presentation on the theoretical and
instrumental aspects of transferring, incorporating, and utilizing health
technology to streamline the delivery of services.

        The cases presented emphasized the need for instruments to enhance
the effective integration of programs by ensuring that they are articulated
with other sectors.

B.      Management Information Systems

        In the area of management information, the countries presented
cases showing how the application of strategic instruments of this kind had
helped to systematize the information used for decision-making.

        This approach is especially useful at the central level, since it
enables local health systems to employ a more comprehensive approach in
dealing with problem situations, thus ensuring that the population's needs
are being linked to existing socioeconomic conditions and to the given
problem-solving capacity of the services.

        One of the presentations reported on a management information
system that has made it possible to focus efforts more precisely by
providing data that compare living and health conditions, identify risks
and resources available, and follow the performance and impact of
activities through the evaluation of micro-trends in sentinel populations.

        Another report described the developent of a district health
system in an urban area.  In this case, social participation played a
fundamental role in consolidating the system.

        Several of the presentations included proposed evaluation schemes
based on the development of groups of indicators.


C.      Legal and Administrative Instruments for Decentralization and
        Municipalization

        On the subject of legal and administrative instruments for
decentralization and municipalization, experiences were presented on
legislation aimed at facilitating the process and providing the legal
framework for the decentralization processes and the organizational and
functional structuring of municipal agencies.

       In addition, there were specific experiences in the strengthening
of municipal governments in order for them to play a major role in all
actions aimed at achieving comprehensive development of the people's
well-being.  These processes promote social participation in all aspects of
public management and, in addition, encourage the processes of
democratization.  This, in turn, enhances the capacity for negotiation and
consensus between the social actors.

        These initiatives and the efforts being undertaken by the
municipal governments are serving as a framework for the development of
local health systems.


D.      Curricula and Strategies for the Training of Health Teams

        Models were presented for developing, as an integral part of the
health team, a continuing education process based on analysis of the local
context, the identification of health problems, the need for training, the
introduction of unconventional methodologies, and the parallel development
of systems t
