ONSIDERATIONS 

     The information presented in regard to research at PAHO was
prepared from the list of research proposals submitted to the
Organization for consideration and possible financing between 1985
and February 1992.  The information was provided by DRC and has been
classified by subregion and priority area.  The information
collected covers all the proposals presented during the period in
question, independent of their approval/rejection status, which is
specified when necessary.  It encompasses not only proposals that
are directly related to WHD but also proposals containing a
component on women that were submitted for consideration by experts
in other Regional programs, with or without the participation of
the Regional Program on Women, Health, and Development.  This group
of proposals is estimated to represent 10% of all the research
undertaken by PAHO. 
     1. Subregions
     The Subregions have been defined as follows: 
1.1. Andean Subregion: Bolivia, Colombia,
Ecuador, Peru, and Venezuela.

1.2. Brazil: Brazil is a subregion unto itself
since it includes a large proportion of both
the geographical area and the population of
South America.

1.3. English- and French-speaking Caribbean:
Antigua and Barbuda, Netherlands Antilles,
Barbados, Belize, Dominica, Guyana, Jamaica,
Haiti, Trinidad and Tobago, and Suriname.

1.4. Spanish-speaking Caribbean: Cuba and the
Dominican Republic.

1.5. Central America: Costa Rica, El Salvador,
Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, and Panama.

1.6. Southern Cone: Argentina, Chile, Paraguay,
and Uruguay.

1.7. Mexico: A subregion unto itself for the
same reasons as Brazil, and to differentiate
it from the other countries of North America.

1.8. North America: Canada and the United
States of America.

     The research proposals are grouped according to this
geographical classification because it is the same one used in
Health Conditions in the Americas and because it makes it possible
to go beyond the national level in analyzing the data. 

     2. Priority Areas

     In 1988 the PAHO Research Coordination Unit (DRC) established
several priority areas in which research grants were to be awarded. 
This classification, which is presented below in summary form, is
used in this document to group the research proposals by subject
area.  
     2.1. Health Profiles:  Includes studies that, using easily
measured indicators based on the spatial distribution of poverty,
focus on the heterogeneity of morbidity and mortality profiles and
the health needs found in different local population areas, with
special emphasis on urban areas.
     2.2. Processes of Health Technology Development: Includes four
specific areas:
     - Supply of technology:  Transfer, production, and
     adaptation of technologies and products.
     - Demand for and use of technology:  Selection,
     dissemination, assimilation, coverage, and access to
     technology, as well as operation, conservation, and
     maintenance of equipment.
     - Technological development policies:  Includes the study
     of the legal-political, institutional, and financial
     instruments that have to do with the demand for and use
     of technologies.
     2.3. Health Manpower:  Focuses on personnel training issues
with a view to strengthening and integrating health services at the
local level.  Includes the following areas:
     - Labor market:  Supply and demand, structural conditions
     of the labor market in health.
     - Sociology of professions:  Political and ideological
     dimensions of health practices.
     - Work force and production:  Analysis of the
     effectiveness and productivity of work in the area of
     health.
     - Personnel training:  Methodologies for studying the
     integration of instruction and service and for continuing
     education.
     2.4. Organization of Health Systems and Services: Includes
research to support the development of local health systems in the
framework of decentralization.
     2.5. Health Economics and Financing:  Includes research that
examines the relationship between economics and health, especially
as regards the impact of the crisis, with a view to identifying
alternatives that will ensure equity, efficiency, and effectiveness. 
     2.6. Organization of Sanitation Systems and Services:  Includes
the following priority lines of research: 
     - Institutional factors that affect the quality and
     provision of environmental sanitation services.
     - Identification of critical technological deficiencies.
     2.7. Processes of Growth, Development, and Human Reproduction:
Research to determine the risk and protection factors associated
with these processes and to study the health services that exist
to address problems in this area. 
     2.8. Health/Disease in the Adult Population: In a frame of
reference that encompasses the social, cultural, economic, and
political conditions that affect adult health, research under this
heading focuses on the following: 
     - Evaluation of programs or models for health promotion
     among adults. 
     - Support for the planning and adaptation of services and
     technologies to meet the health needs of adults. 
     2.9. Health and Work:  Priority consideration is given to
proposals that address this issue from the following perspectives:
     - Analysis of the capacity of health services to develop
     workers' health programs.
     - Epidemiological surveillance in the area of workers'
     health.
     - Health problems of specific groups of workers.
     2.10. Health of the Elderly:  Includes consideration of the
biological, social, cultural, and economic aspects of the aging
process with a view to encouraging the formulation of policies and
plans.
     2.11. Women, Health, and Development: From a historical
perspective and taking into account cultural, social, economic, and
political factors, priority is given to proposals that have to do
with legislation and policies aimed at preventing discrimination
against and abuse of women; the influence that is exerted by women's
organizations in the design and implementation of policies that have
the potential to improve living conditions for women in society;
the identification of indicators that make it possible to determine
the contribution of women from different social backgrounds to
socioeconomic development; the incorporation of women in the work
force and the repercussions thereof on health; and the
identification and characterization of forms of violence against
women.
     2.12. Biotechnology:  This is a priority within the area of
Priority Technological Development.  Support is given to proposals
for the development and evaluation of methods to diagnose important
diseases using reagents that are available or that are to be
developed through the proposed research.

     The area of WHD is emphasized above in order to clearly show
that there are specific types of proposals that are considered under
this specific heading.  It is important to distinguish between
proposals that are submitted under the priority area of WHD and
proposals that contain what has been called a component on women
but are submitted under one of the other areas mentioned above. 
     In the data presented, when reference is made to proposals
under WHD, the proposals indicated were classified by DRC--by virtue
of the issues they addressed and their theoretical and
methodological approach--for evaluation by the Coordination of the
Regional Program on Women, Health, and Development on the basis of
the priorities discussed above, and, of course, the quality of the
research design and the feasibility of execution.  Proposals with
a component on women, on the other hand, are proposals that deal
explicitly with some facet of women's issues but are submitted for
appraisal by some other Regional program.  It is important to
clarify that these definitions are used exclusively for the purpose
of classifying proposals since, as was discussed in the previous
section, delimiting the subject matter to be studied can be quite
a complex task.
    III.  RESEARCH ON WOMEN AT PAHO

     1.  General Situation of Research at PAHO

     It was considered important to include in this report general
information on the research proposals submitted to PAHO for
consideration in order to be able to make some comparison with
respect to those submitted specifically on the subject of women.
     Table 1 shows all the research proposals received during the
period under consideration, classified by subregion as defined
above.

     More than 60% of all proposals originate in the Southern Cone,
Brazil, and Mexico.  However, it is interesting to note statistics
on acceptance and rejection of these proposals by the Committees
responsible for evaluating them.
     Table 2 reflects the statistics on approval or rejection of
proposals by subregion, with the percentages for each one.

     As can be seen from the preceding table, the ratio of total
proposals approved to total proposals received is much higher for
the English- and French-speaking Caribbean (62.5%) than for the rest
of the subregions; it is followed by Central America (39.0%), the
Andean Subregion (29.7%), and Brazil (27.6%).

     It is also interesting to note the proportion of proposals that
are approved in each of the priority areas established by PAHO. 
Table 3 shows the percentage distribution of proposals approved in
relation to the total received in each of the priority areas.

     It should be noted that the lowest percentages are in the areas
of Women, Health, and Development and Organization of Health
Services and Systems.  In other areas the proportion of proposals
approved ranges from 25% to 50%.  The proportion of 100% in the area
of Scientific Activity in Health reflects the fact that only five
proposals were submitted and these were part of a PAHO multicenter
research project which, because it is relevant to the subject matter
being discussed in this report, will be described below. 
     With regard to the percentages of proposals approved by
priority area and by subregion, this information is presented in
Chart I, with percentages for the period 1985-1992.

     One of the partial conclusions that can be drawn on the
basis of the data presented thus far is that the percentage
of proposals approved is quite low for all subject areas and
subregions.

2.  Proposals under WHD and Proposals with a Component on
Women

     Taking into account the conceptual clarifications made
above, the following figures and tables reflect the situation
of research on women at PAHO.  Figure 1 shows the proportion
of proposals under WHD, as well as proposals with a component
on women, in relation to the total number of proposals
received.
GRAPH 1


PROPOSALS UNDER WHD AND PROPOSALS WITH A COMPONENT ON WOMEN 
IN RELATION TO ALL OTHER AREAS 


























     Source: DRC\PAHO\WHO. Washington, 1992.



     Only 2.2% of all proposals fall under WHD, while 9.8% of all
proposals have a component on women.
     Table 4 shows proposals with a component on women and
proposals under WHD, by approval/rejection status and priority
area.

     Note that this table includes 16 proposals under the heading
of Women, Health, and Development, which are understood to be
included among the proposals with a component on women.
     It should be noted that the percentage approval of proposals
relating to women is lower (21.9%) than for all proposals in all
areas (28.7%).  If the 16 proposals under WHD were excluded, the
percentage approval would rise to 24%, which is closer to the
percentage for all proposals. 
     The following table presents these same figures for
proposals specifically classified under the priority area of
Women, Health, and Development.

     Proposals were prepared specifically in relation to WHD in
only four of the subregions, and the only Subregion that
succeeded in having any proposals approved was the Southern Cone.
     It is important to note that only 12.5% of all proposals
under WHD are approved against the similarly low figure of 21.9%
(or 24.0% if the proposals under WHD are excluded) for proposals
that include a component on women (Table 4).  The contrast is
even more striking when the WHD percentage is compared to the
percentage approval for all proposals (Tables 1 and 2).  
     As for distribution of the proposals over the time period
studied, only one proposal was received from 1991 to February
1992, while fifteen were received during the 1985-1990 period. 
This distribution over time is shown in Figure 2, in relation
to the rest of the proposals with a component on women.
FIGURE 2

     It should be borne in mind that for all the data presented
herein, the information on 1992 corresponds only to January and
February.  It is expected that there will be an increase in the
number of proposals with a component on women that are received
if the trend noted prior to 1990 continues.
     It is particularly interesting to consider the specific
subject areas covered by the proposals with a component on women
and those under WHD.  Table 6 shows the distribution of proposals
by specific subject area during the period considered.

     The data included here show that more than 70% of proposals
on women are concentrated in the areas of occupational health
and reproductive health, which is consistent with what was seen
in relation to the priority areas.  Table 7 shows the
distribution of proposals by status.

     The highest percentage of proposals was approved for the
study of violence (i.e., violence against women), reflecting the
priority assigned to this subject under the WHD Program.  It
should be taken into account that this is quite a new subject
area for research and only five proposals have been presented. 
Of these, two have been approved.
     It could be concluded that the percentage approval of
proposals under WHD is quite low--only 12.5% of all the proposals
received.  In fact, it is the lowest figure of all the priority
areas, consistent with the proportion of such proposals in
relation to the total received (Figure 1).  
     As regards the content of the proposals, it is noteworthy
that a significant proportion continue to be formulated in the
areas of reproductive health and occupational health, which
points up the conception of women as a "risk group" without
regard to the social dimension of women's health problems.  The
same observation could be made for the proposals formulated in
the area of adult health.     The fact that proposals are being
formulated on violence is important, particularly since a gender
approach must almost always be adopted if this problem is to be
truly understood.  Proposals in the areas of health services and
human resources also offer the opportunity for introducing gender
perspectives in the explanation of women's health problems. 

     3.  The Role of Women in Research on Women

     One of the ways in which a profile can be constructed of the
research proposals received by any institution that finances and
promotes research is on the basis of the characteristics of the
principal investigators and their institutional affiliation. 
Although the information presented here is not averred to be
sufficient or exhaustive in this respect, an analysis will be
made of the principal investigators by sex and by type of
institution with which they are affiliated.
     Table 8 presents this information in relation to the
proposals with a component on women that were received by PAHO.

     Almost 70% of the institutional affiliations are
universities and research institutes, with health service
affiliation representing quite a low percentage (5.5%).
     As for sex of the principal investigators, though women
submit more proposals than men, the proposal approval rate is
higher for men than for women (39.4% for men, 25.0% for women),
which leads to the following noteworthy considerations.
     In a recent study concluded at the end of 1991 it was found
that in the countries that account for more than 90% of
scientific production in the Region the majority of investigators
in the area of health area are women.  In countries where this
is not the case, women represent almost half of the total.  In
other words, female participation in research, especially when
considered over time, is growing.  What is not clear from the
aforementioned study is the position of women in terms of control
over the proposals.  A review of some of the data available
suggests two important points (among others):  first, it is only
relatively recently that women that have come to account for the
majority of investigators; and second, in the countries that have
the largest number of women engaged in health research, in
previously male-dominated fields such as biomedical research more
than 50% of the investigators are now women.
     This information is interesting from the following
standpoint:  it can be assumed that the same phenomenon is
occurring in the area of research on women and health, where most
proposals are submitted by female principal investigators;
however, the profile of the subject areas covered by those
proposals does not reflect the impact of the "feminization" of
research.  This can be seen in Table 3, which indicates that
almost 70% of the proposals received were concentrated in areas
that do not necessarily incorporate a gender perspective.
     One possibility would be to introduce the subject of women
from a different perspective, one that is more typical of what
is now understood as WHD.  If a whole set of variables that
intervene in this process were controlled--for example, financing
and institutional affiliation of the investigators and proposals-
-there would be a certain basis for affirming that the
"feminization" of research could have an impact on the selection
of subject matter and thus on the orientation of research.
     Findings from the study cited above reveal that the
feminization of health research is taking place through a process
of substitution, i.e., new generations of health professionals,
and thus potential investigators, include an increasing number
of women.  These women will eventually replace the men who are
currently engaged in research, who are aging and will therefore
soon be leaving the profession.
     In this connection, Tables 9 and 10 below show the
distribution of research proposals by sex of the principal
investigator.

     Although as regards the proposals submitted to the PAHO
grants program there continue to be more male than female
principal investigators, in some subregions the percentages of
females approaches that of males.  It should also be taken into
account that these proposals are representative of only a small
portion of all the research being conducted in the countries.

     Here it can be observed that in certain areas the majority
of principal investigators are women--specifically in the areas
of Growth, Development, and Reproduction, and Women, Health, and
Development.  With respect to Scientific Activity in Health, as
was indicated above, this area includes only five proposals,
which are interrelated.  There is also a significant female
presence in the area of Political Processes and Health.  
     What should be emphasized here is that the field of health
research has come to have a high level of female participation,
and this trend does not appear likely to be reversed in coming
years.  It would seem that the feminization of scientific work
in the area of health should be seen as a condition that needs
to be taken into account when planning the delivery of technical
cooperation for the production of knowledge from the perspective
of Women, Health, and Development.  This idea will be expanded
below.III-CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

     1. Conclusions

     1.1. The Evaluation of research: The figures presented in
this report on the percentages of proposals approved and rejected
appear to point in two directions.  The first has to do with the
quality and relevance of the proposals submitted to the
Secretariat, which could help to explain why less than one-
third of all the  proposals received are ultimately approved. 
More in-depth consideration could be given to this matter by
examining the reasons for rejection or approval as reflected in
the proceedings of meetings of the evaluating committee. 
     The second has to do with how--once the above-mentioned
criteria are known--the proposals submitted are appraised, what
scientific requirements are imposed, and what criteria are used
in judging them.  However, this is a task that corresponds to
other entities; it is mentioned here only because it affects the
area with which this report is concerned.  As was seen above,
although the proposals formulated specifically under WHD account
for a very small percentage of the total, if the situations
mentioned above were closely examined it would be clear that they
also affect these proposals. 
     1.2. Subject matter studied under WHD: In classifying the
proposals by priority area it has been considered that the
proposals that fall under the heading of WHD are those that have
been submitted to the Regional Program on WHD for evaluation. 
However, as was stated at the outset, owing to the eminently
political and social nature of the perspective adopted by the
Regional Program, its sphere of action has not been precisely
defined, nor is it expected that it can be, given this
orientation.  However, each proposal, in its formulation and
execution, contains elements that contribute theoretically,
methodologically, and empirically to progress toward such a
definition.  This characteristic of the social disciplines should
be taken into account in the formulation of research proposals
in this area.
     1.3. Characteristics of the research proposals:  The way in
which women's issues are approached in the proposals submitted
continues to reflect a mainly biomedical focus.  Proposals under
the area of WHD represent less than 3% of all proposals received,
while three of the areas traditionally linked to biomedical
approaches account for almost 70% of all proposals submitted for
consideration.  Within these areas, the area of Growth,
Development, and Reproduction accounts for almost 40% of the
total.  These figures serve to illustrate the biomedical bent
of the most of the proposals.  A gender perspective needs to be
cultivated first in the areas that are considered most propitious
for this purpose.  In this regard, the analysis of the breakdown
of the specific areas in which proposals on women were formulated
provides an idea of what these strategic priority areas should
be.
     With respect to the number of proposals approved, although
there was a significant increase from 1989 to 1990, and while
it is expected that this trend will continue through the end of
the year, the percentage of proposals approved continues to be
low.  
     1.4. Institutional Setting for Research: The work of
producing knowledge about women continues to be an eminently
academic task that is undertaken by research institutes and
universities.  This in itself does not constitute a problem;
however, it is considered that one important indicator of the
impact of research promotion in the field of women's health
should be the formulation of an increasing number of proposals
within the governmental offices of the sector and the health
services.  It would appear that only limited progress has been
made toward this objective.  There may be a sort of institutional
sequence over time, in the sense that the substantive discussions
about theoretical and methodological questions relating to the
subject must first take place in an academic setting and then
be generalized to other spheres of scientific endeavor in the
field of health.  In any case, this sequence might be important
in terms of what was stated under point 1.1. above, and, of
course, with regard to the stimulation of possible interest in
the subject at other types of institutions, especially those
related directly or indirectly to the health sector.
     1.5. Participation by Women: The relatively low levels of
participation by women in the formulation of proposals at PAHO
is illustrated by the data on principal investigators by
subregion (Table 9).  The significance of this situation was
discussed above, as were the implications thereof and the
contrasts with regard to the processes of producing knowledge
about health in the Region in general.  This suggests a series
of hypotheses that might be of interest to investigators and also
points up the need to delimit the problem by identifying all the
variables that are influencing how women produce knowledge about
their own reality.

     2. Recommendations

     2.1. In view of the low percentage of proposals that are
submitted and approved under WHD, it is recommended that a
special effort be made to promote research in this area, that
a closer look be taken at the reasons for rejection or approval
of proposals, and that there be an examination of the
orientations on the basis of which proposals are prepared, taking
into account the relative newness of this area as a topic for
research, as well as the lack of conceptual and methodological
precision.
     2.2. There is a need for greater reflection and discussion
about the theoretical and methodological implications of research
on the subject of Women, Health, and Development.  It is
necessary to begin by creating opportunities for such discussion,
including the organization of at least one meeting during the
current year to bring together experts in the area for the
purpose of formulating conclusions and recommendations on the
gender approach to issues relating to Woman, Health, and
Development.  It is specifically proposed that a meeting--
tentatively titled "Theoretical and Methodological Orientations
for Research on WHD"-- be held, possibly next June, in Caracas,
Venezuela.
     2.3. Research centers that study women should be identified
and a data base, compiled, including information on these
centers' characteristics, production, orientations, and areas
of expertise, with a view to developing strategies for
supranational, multicenter, and interinstitutional cooperation
at the subregional and Regional levels in order to enrich the
theoretical-methodological discussion and to promote
collaboration for the formulation of more significant and higher
quality proposals.  The Regional Program has at its disposal the
initial elements needed to develop such a data base and design
the strategies required.  It is proposed that this task be one
of the cooperation targets for the 1992-1993 biennium.
     2.4. There appears to be a need to partially redefine the
priorities established in the area of WHD, taking into account
the specific areas in which proposals having to do with women
are formulated.  Work from a gender perspective in an area such
as occupational health, for example--especially in view of the
fact that 1992 is the Year of Workers' Health--would make it
possible to change the perspective from which proposals are
formulated.  This subject can also be linked to Manpower
Development and Health Services Development, bearing in mind the
objectives of the Regional Program on WHD.  It would be desirable
to include this topic on the agenda of the meeting proposed for
June.
     2.5. The examination of research in the area of WHD appears
to be increasingly important in the determination of
participation by women in the process of producing knowledge. 
Although it appears that the administration of health research
will tend to be in women's hands in coming decades, this trend
does not suffice to guarantee that a gender perspective will be
adopted in research on women.  A very special effort will be
needed to generate awareness in this regard and to thus have an
impact on the thematic and disciplinary profile of scientific
production in the area of WHD.  We propose that a special effort
be made to encourage proposals that, while meeting requirements
for high scientific quality, will address these issues.BIBLIOGRAPHY

     COOPERATION OF THE PAN AMERICAN HEALTH ORGANIZATION
IN WORKERS' HEALTH



PAHO AND COOPERATION IN WORKERS' HEALTH

In the PAHO/WHO Representations (general support
and actions by the Focal Point for Environmental and
Occupational Health)

Through general activities (sharing of 
information and knowledge, training,
fellowships, research, intercountry initiatives,
intercountry cooperation)

Through the activities of various programs

Through the Program on Workers' Health
(coordinated by Environmental Health)


1.         INTRODUCTION
Cooperation in the area of workers' health will be examined in terms of general
PAHO cooperation and the specific capacity of the Program on Workers' Health.

-          The Pan American Sanitary Bureau was established on 2 December 1902 with the
proposed objective of achieving improved sanitary conditions in the countries of
the Americas.

-          The cooperation provided by PAHO in the area of workers' health falls within the
context of Health for All (HFA 2000) and the primary health care strategy,
designed to benefit the entire population, including the working age population (14
years of age and over), which in Latin America and the Caribbean comes to more
than 55%.  The efforts to be expended by the programs in the areas of health
systems infrastructure and health development are enormous, since 43% of the
population does not have access to health services and less than 10% of the workers
have general coverage that includes health promotion, maintenance, and the
prevention of negative effects on health as well as the usual curative and
rehabilitative care and financial benefits in the event of work-related disability.

2.         COOPERATION PROVIDED BY THE PAHO/WHO REPRESENTATIONS

Workers' health stands to benefit from the cooperation provided the countries
through their PAHO/WHO Representations located in all the countries of Latin America
and in many of the Caribbean countries, which have a Focal Point for Workers' Health
that is usually also the Focal Point for Environmental Health, as well as from the support
provided by certain basic actions of the Organization.

-          The cooperation provided by the PAHO/WHO Representations in workers' health
is also supported by the collaboration provided by the Program at Headquarters and
by the mechanisms referred to in the section below.


3.         GENERAL MECHANISMS OF COOPERATION

-          Dissemination of knowledge (via PAHO/WHO publications, bibliographic
resources and libraries, and advisory services upon specific request).

-          Fellowship programs, which can support the training of experts in workers' health
when the countries consider this to be a priority.

-          Awards under the Organization's Research Grants Program, when high-
caliber proposals are presented that meet the requirements and correspond to areas
identified as having priority for workers' health.

-          In the context provided by the subregional initiatives (Andean, Central American,
Southern Cone, and Caribbean).

-          In the context provided by the intercountry cooperation initiatives.

-          Through the program responsible for resource mobilization, which can assist the
countries in identifying cooperation agencies and in establishing bilateral
cooperation plans.

-          Through the various programs under the area of Health Systems Infrastructure and
under Health Programs Development.






4.         INTERPROGRAM COOPERATION

Activities to be carried out in 1992 as defined by the PAHO Interprogram Group
on Workers' Health:

All the PAHO programs will arrange to undertake activities that are specifically
oriented toward workers' health.  Considerations related to workers' health will be
included in all publications, meetings, courses, and other activities.  Efforts will be made
to ensure that the agendas of congresses and other events include topics relating to
workers' health.

As a mechanism for promoting activities in the countries and as an indication of
the support being given to all the programs, Headquarters staff, in their missions to the
countries, should address matters in the area of workers' health.

The Annual Report of the Director will stress workers' health (contact Dr. Teruel -
 Magdalena Collins).

DAP        Analysis and Strategic Planning Coordination

-          Evaluation of compliance with Resolution XIII of the XXIII Pan American
Sanitary Conference on Strategic Orientations and Program Priorities in the area
of workers' health.

DEC        External Relations Coordination

-          Collaboration on, and revision of, plans and projects to be distributed for purposes
of resource mobilization.

-          Identification of agencies with interest in workers' health, and support for a
meeting specifically aimed at mobilizing resources for workers' health.

-          Preparation of a document on the economic and social importance of workers'
health and on the priority it represents for PAHO, as evidenced by the approval of
Resolution XIII.  Transmittal of the document to IDB and other agencies to
promote consideration of this component in cooperation projects (jointly with
WH).

-          Identification of PAHO projects currently under way in which it is would be
appropriate to include a component on workers' health (jointly with WH).


DPI        Information and Public Affairs 

-          Development of a logo for the Year of Workers' Health.

-          Development of a workers' health component for inclusion in the video unit on
environmental health to be exhibited at Expo 92.

-          Reference to 1992 as the Year of Workers' Health in photographic displays on the
health situation in the Americas and in the section on PAHO in the pamplet for the
Inter-American Exhibit.

-          Reference to the Year of Workers' Health and the subject of workers' health as part
of World Health Day and World No-Tobacco Day (and in any another material
being distributed to the public).

-          Promotion of the Year of Workers' Health in connection with celebration of the
90th Anniversary of PAHO.

-          Identification of strategies and sources of assistance for promotion of the Initiative.

-          Collaboration in optimizing the use of the mass media.

DRC        Research Coordination

-          Promotion of multicenter projects on health and labor, to be totally or partially
financed by the Research Grants Program.

PED        Emergency Preparedness and Disaster Relief

-          Interprogram development of actions to prevent and mitigate disasters in the
workplace, especially in industries that deal with chemical substances and
radioactive materials.

-          Training of health workers in selected hospitals on how to prepare for a disaster. 
Dissemination of the series on safety in hospitals.
