 all cases, the majority in three
states.  Even within these states, the cases were concentrated in
specific areas.

C.   World trends

     From 1975 to 1979, there was a reduction in the number of
cases of malaria reported, due largely to the control measures
taken in India against an outbreak of the disease.  Since 1985, the
number of reported cases in India has stabilized, at present it
continues to climb.  Malaria incidence in China has continued to
decline thanks to the positive results in integrating the malaria
campaign into the primary health care system.  Excluding India and
China, it appears that the malaria situation is deteriorating. 
Among the areas particularly susceptible to this deterioration are
the "peripheral regions" of Southeast Asia and South America.  The
situation has not changed a great deal in the highly endemic areas
of Africa, but large-scale epidemics have been reported in areas
with less endemicity (see Table 1).
II. STATUS OF MALARIA IN THE AMERICAS, 1990

     In 1990 it was estimated that 278 million people in the Region
of the Americas lived in malarious areas.  The rate of morbidity
due to malaria was 149.67 per 100,000 population, while in 1974
morbidity was only 49.37 per 100,000 inhabitants.  As can be
observed in Table 2, in the last four years more than one million
cases have been registered in the Region; this figure reflects a
worsening of the problem in the Region.

     In the 21 countries with active malaria control programs,
1,042,817 cases were confirmed as of the end of the year, with an
Annual Parasite Incidence of 2.53 per 1,000 population, as
described in Table 3 and Figure 2.

     French Guiana continues to have the highest annual parasite
incidence, as it has since 1987; in 1990, the API was 64.23 per
1,000 population; Guyana and Belize had an API of 21.81 per 1,000
and 16.57 per 1,000 respectively.  The annual blood examination
rate (ABER) was highest in French Guiana and Belize.  The
malariometric rates of 21 countries in the last five years are
shown in Table 4; the regional total for the last 30 years is shown
in Figure 3.


III.CURRENT SITUATION OF MALARIA PROGRAMS IN THE AMERICAS

A.   General Information

     In 1990 it was estimated that the population of the Americas
was 698,199,000, of which 278,600,000 lived in areas originally
considered malarious, i.e. 39.8% of the total population, living
in 50.60% of the total area of the Hemisphere (see Tables 5, 6, and
7).

     During the year there were 1,045,808 cases of malaria in 36
countries of the Americas.  Of this total, 7,221 cases were
detected in areas considered non-malarious and 29,550 in areas
where transmission has existed or has been interrupted for more
than three years (maintenance phase), for a total of 36,771 cases
(i.e. 3.51% of the total) diagnosed in areas without permanent
transmission of malaria (see Table 8).

     These figures reflect the constant pressure for transmission
in areas still vulnerable.  In these areas the development of
institutions for social protection is still deficient, making it
difficult to detect epidemics.  Usually, these vulnerable areas are
characterized as areas of traffic or reception of migratory flows, 
be they organized or spontaneous, from areas with permanent malaria
transmission.

     In 1990, the transmission of epidemics by P.  vivax in
vulnerable areas of Brazil (Foz do IguaÛu and Manaus), and of
Mexico (Guerrero, Michoacán, and Oaxaca), was controlled through
the implementation of integrated control measures.  These actions
have been adapted to the particular characteristics of these areas,
strengthening the concept of that the transmission of malaria is
a focal problem, for which solutions and successful intervention
measures depend on local planning and execution, as described below
in the individual country descriptions.  

     The countries used different epidemiological surveillance
systems.  Thus in Cuba, where 801,946 blood samples of travelers
who entered the country were examined, 462 cases were detected. 
In the United States of America, where detection depends on
spontaneous demand, 877 cases were detected (Table 8 and Map 2). 
Of the 7,221 cases registered in non-malarious areas, 378 cases
were registered in the Bahamas (4), Barbados (3), Bermuda (3), and
Canada (368); and 6,843 in other countries with originally non-
malarious areas (Table 9).

     Among the 21 countries of the Region of the Americas where
transmission of malaria now occurs, 1,044,069 malaria cases were
registered in 1990 (see Table 9 and Figure 4).  Based on the
situation in that year, the 21 countries with active malaria
programs can be divided into the following subregions.  

Mexico, Central America, Belize, and Panama.  

     This subregion, in which we include the eight contiguous
countries of Middle America--Belize, Costa Rica, El Salvador,
Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, Nicaragua, and Panama--has 59,990,000
inhabitants living in areas originally malarious, i.e. 54.80% of
a total population of 109,482,000 inhabitants.  In Mexico, 49.3%
of the population lives in malarious areas.  In the other seven
countries, 19,990,000 individuals, or 70.3% of the total
population, live in such areas (Tables 10 and 11).

     Nonetheless, taking the annual parasitic incidence (API) as
an indicator of the magnitude of the malaria problem, it is
observed that the risk of these population groups becoming ill of
malaria in these countries ranges from 0.16 cases per 1,000
population exposed in Panama, to 16.57 per 1,000 in Belize.  In
addition, the distribution of risk varies from country to country
(see Map 3).

     In 1990 Belize had the highest annual parasitic incidence for
the subregion, with areas as the Cayo district having an API of 45
per 1,000 inhabitants.  Despite the notable flow of population from
El Petén, Guatemala to Chiapas, Mexico through Belize, 98.5% of the
cases diagnosed have been due to P.  vivax infections.

     In Costa Rica 1,146 P.  vivax infections were registered, as
were five cases due to P.  falciparum.  The malarious area of the
country encompasses 69.6% of the national territory; but the
transmission of malaria is concentrated in three provinces, where
85% of the cases were detected.  Costa Rica has attained a high
degree of control over the endemic disease, reflecting the
country's high level of social development.

     In El Salvador the trend to control malaria that was initiated
in the 1980s has been maintained, after developing a work process
based on epidemiological stratification and the integration of
diagnostic, treatment, and epidemiological surveillance services. 
Of the 9,269 cases registered during the year, 80% were detected
in 62 of the country's 262 municipalities, which are considered to
constitute the hyper-endemic area.

     Guatemala has reported the diagnosis of 41,711 cases of
malaria (97.6% P.  vivax).  Even though the distribution of risk
is well-known, i.e. that five of the country's 22 departments
accounted for 65% of all cases registered, very little progress was
made in controlling the endemic disease.

     Honduras, with 288 municipalities, has reported the diagnosis
of 53,095 cases (98.8% P.  vivax) in 64 municipalities located in
six departments.  Honduras continues to use universal spraying and
medication with antimalarial drugs, but has yet to attain a
positive impact in controlling the endemic disease.  Although
efforts to analyze the malaria problem were stepped up in 1990,
changes in intervention strategies have not yet been carried out. 

     In Mexico the epidemiological situation improved
significantly, with a turnaround in the trend toward uncontrolled
spread of the transmission of P.  vivax, which began in 1983.  The
reduction of the magnitude of the malaria problem from an API of
1.17 per 1,000 population in 1989 to 4 per 1,000 in 1990, reflects
an intense mobilization of resources allocated to strengthening the
technical capability of states with transmission and those where
tourism is important.  Furthermore, the epidemiological conditions
of southern Mexico continue to generate foci of transmission; and
P. falciparum persists in the jungle (logging) region of the border
with Guatemala and Belize.

     Nicaragua reported 35,785 cases of malaria (95.6% P. vivax)
in 1990, maintaining an API of 9.24 cases per 1,000 inhabitants. 
In 49 of the country's 143 municipalities, where 29.3% of the
population lives, the risk of becoming infected with malaria is
three times greater than in the rest of the country.  

     The country has operational contrasts that are noteworthy. 
The municipality of León, through the efforts of the local health
authority, has reduced the transmission of malaria by 80% from 1988
to 1990.  This achievement has been attained through a careful
study of local stratification of transmission and a precise
definition of the risk factors associated with the area generating
cases.  In the context of intersectoral municipal actions, vast
breeding sites hitherto unknown have been drained.  In other
smaller breeding sites, traditional cleaning treatments and
application of larvicides were used.  In the municipality of El
Viejo, characterized by the production of cotton and sugarcane with
involving the intense application of pesticides, the national
control program continues to use traditional measures, i.e
intradomiciliary spraying of insecticides and active case detection
and treatment.  Even with these measures, this municipality still
had the highest API in the country in 1990 (71.7 per 1,000
population).

     In Panama persistence continues in three areas that are
generating cases.  These are the province of Darién, the San Blas
District, and the Bayano region.  These areas account for 32.3% of
the national territory and 3.4% of the population of the country;
transmission is detected in 72 localities, i.e. 0.74% of all
localities in the country.  Despite the low total number of cases,
27.56% of the infections are by P.  falciparum (Table 6).

Caribbean Area

     In the Caribbean region, the island of Hispaniola (Haiti and
the Dominican Republic) continues to constitute an area of
transmission by P. falciparum.  Haiti launched a program financed
specifically for the integrated control of malaria; it is detailed
in the section on specific countries.

     In the Dominican Republic epidemiological surveillance has
been maintained.  A total of 297,599 blood slides were examined,
with a positive result in 356 cases; 22 were by P. vivax, and were
probably imported.

Andean Area

     In the Andean subregion, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, and
Venezuela reported 254,803 cases of malaria, with a population of
54,339,000, or 58.3% of the total population of the malarious
areas, in the original malarious area.  These cases represented an
increase in 13.54%, driving the annual parasitic incidence of the
subregion up to 4.7 cases per 1,000 population (see Maps 4 and 5).

     Considering that in Colombia, Ecuador, and Venezuela more than
one-fourth of the cases registered were infections by P. 
falciparum, the situation should be considered serious.

     Infections by P. falciparum in Colombia (35,490) and Ecuador
(21,871) showed a proportional distribution different from the
classical epidemiological picture.  The cases in Colombia, which
had been concentrated in the northeast (Sarare Region), came to be
concentrated in the west (Pacific Coast); the Middle Magdalena
remained relatively unchanged.  In addition, four provinces of
Ecuador (Esmeraldas, Manabi, Guayas, and Los Ríos) accounted for
92.45% of cases registered of P.  falciparum (19,081), reflecting
the same pattern of the neighboring country.  This contrasts with
the classical Ecuadorian distribution of P.  falciparum in the
valleys of the Putumayo along the border with Colombia and the
valley of the Napo river in the Amazon region. 

     Venezuela continued to have the highest proportion of
infections due to P. falciparum in jungle areas of its Amazon
region (federal territory of Amazonas and the state of Bolívar). 
(See description under Amazon Region together with Brazil and the
Guianas).

     Bolivia registered 19,680 cases and Peru 28,882 (up to October
1990), of which 3.31% and 0.45% respectively were diagnosed as P. 
falciparum.  This situation is characterized by apparent endemic
stability.  The relative increase in the diagnosis of cases due to
P.  falciparum in Peru, from zero in 1988 to 131 in 1990, has
originated mainly in the region of Piura, Tumbes.  This region has
the known focus of San Lorenzo, which challenged the interruption
of transmission in Peru during the eradication period.  The
reinitiation of transmission by P.  falciparum in a country that
had interrupted it completely and for many years is dispiriting. 


Amazon Region

     For the purpose of studying malaria, we consider as a part of
this region to be constituted by the macroregion of the political-
administrative division known as the Amazonia in Brazil, French
Guiana, Guyana, Suriname, and the area south of the Orinoco river
basin in Venezuela (state of Bolívar and federal territory of
Amazonas) (see Map 4).

     This region is characterized as an "area of malaria that
cannot be reached" by the old strategy of eradication.  In these
areas traditional control measures such as intradomiciliary
spraying and case detection and treatment did not present the
results attained in areas with greater population density, where
the basic indicators for social and economic development were
higher.

     However, in this region the last decade has seen the opening
of "great frontiers" as part of a model of economic development
that does not attribute sufficient priority to the development and
social protection of man.  These frontiers of economic development
have generated large-scale human circulation, with a high capacity
for mobilization created by the opening of roads and air and river
transport facilities, creating serious ecological imbalances.  In
addition to the foregoing, there are large numbers of susceptible
persons but the expansion of the parasitic reservoir, as well as
the increase in population density of the vectors, favored by the
ecological changes.

     In the context of state lack of social protection, the
traditional control programs were taken by surprise with malaria
control measures that were inappropriate for the region and without
a specific possibility for developing intersectoral social
protection measures, sometimes due to the absence of institutions
in the area and other times due to the lack of a technical strategy
for generating new measures of a broader social nature. 

     This Amazon region has reported the diagnosis of 622,160 cases
of malaria, of which, 278,421 were infections due to P. falciparum. 
They were originated mainly in the jungles of the Amazon area,
which account for 80.6% of all diagnosed cases of P. falciparum in
the Region of the Americas.

Southern Cone

     In this area, which as regards malaria is represented mainly
by Paraguay and Argentina, is very affected in certain areas by the
population flow from southern Brazil through Paraguay (see Map 5).

     These two countries, with a population in malarious areas of
7,947,000 inhabitants, registered 4,572 malaria cases (API of 0.39
per 1,000 and 0.79 per 1,000 population respectively).

     The traditional reservoir of cases in Paraguay (Amambay) has
expanded considerably due to agricultural development, particularly
since the creation of the Itaipú reservoir, which has forced the
country to reactivate areas of "attack" as part of its eradication
strategy.  Furthermore, the construction of the reservoirs and dams
along the border with Argentina merit special attention.  Thus
engineering works should work to keep to a minimum the creation of
conditions that are optimal for expanding vector density, because
of increased relative moisture in the air caused by falling water. 

B.   Status of Malaria in Countries with Transmission of the
     Disease

      Table 12 shows a comparison between the passive and active
search of cases in each of the countries.  In general the largest
numbers of malaria patients continue to be detected through passive
search.  However, seven countries have yet to change their system
for finding malaria cases.  These countries, Argentina, Bolivia,
Costa Rica, Panama, the Dominican Republic, Paraguay, and
Venezuela, continue preferring active searching, though less cases
are discovered with this method than through passive searching. 
Thus in 1990, the efforts and costs of these countries for taking
a total of 861,733 blood samples by active search produced barely
15,721 positive slides, for a positive slide index (PSI) of 1.8%. 
By contrast, 414,431 blood samples taken by passive search (half
of active search) came up with 45,501 positive cases, i.e. three
times more than those discovered by active searching. 

Field Operations 

      Use of insecticides continues to be the principal control
measure.  Table 13 shows the number of insecticide sprayings during
1989 and 1990 in the malaria programs.  Table 14 shows the
insecticides used in 1990 in each country and the estimate for
1991.  Table 15 lists the quantities used from 1987 to 1990.  DDT
is still the insecticide most used, though in several countries,
especially Central America, they are no longer used. 

     Antimalarial drugs are used for continuous presumptive
treatment in most of the countries.  Table 16 shows the quantities
utilized, country by country, for 1990 and the estimated figures
for 1991.  Table 17 shows data on the total quantities of drugs
consumed from 1986 to 1990.

     Table 18 contains information on personnel used in the malaria
programs in 1989 and 1990.

Problems in Developing the Malaria Programs

      The problems that face the malaria programs are summarized
in Table 19.  Although information is lacking on five countries
that have both technical and administrative problems, the table
shows the population, area, insecticides used, and number of cases
registered, the principal vectors, and the causes of the problem. 
In the 13 countries that appear in that table, 621,722 cases were
diagnosed, i.e. 59.6% of all cases registered in the 21 malarious
countries of the Americas.


Country Information

      Below is a brief description of the malaria situation in each
country, including a table and a graph showing the malariometric
rates from 1960 to 1990.


ARGENTINA 

     The malaria control program reported that:

     a) fulfillment of coverage programmed for epidemiological
surveillance was 87.2%; 

     b) intradomiciliary spraying was 62.5% of coverage programmed;

     c) the fulfillment of coverage programmed is insufficient, due
mainly to the lack of funds, or the fact that the funds needed by
services are not available; 

     d) the resources available were oriented to covering areas at
greater risk;

     e) during the year there was a significant reduction of
personnel (authority, laboratories);

     f) no evidence was observed of resistance to the insecticides
and/or drugs.

BELIZE 

     In 1990, 3,033 cases of malaria were registered; 98.5% were
infections by P.  vivax.  The API declined in 1990 to 16.57 per
1,000 population as compared to 18.46 per 1,000 for 1989.  As in
previous years, the transmission of malaria continued to be high
in the districts of Cayo and Toledo, with 40 and 47 cases per 1,000
population respectively.  The districts of the north continued to
have a similar prevalence; only the district of Belize registered
a lower number of cases.

     The Ministry of Health of Belize adopted the strategy of
"Integrated Control" with the support of other ministries, such as
Agriculture, Natural Resources, and Education.
BOLIVIA 

     Currently there appears to be better integration of the
specific activities for detection and treatment of cases by the
general health services, which detected 69% of all malaria cases. 

     A comparative analysis of the last decade demonstrates the
trend of malaria through the classical indicators.  In 1980 there
was a PSI of 11.6%, which fell to 4.0% in 1983 and began to rise
in 1989, when it reached 22.5%.  However, in 1980 the PSI was
16.2%, which indicates a relative reduction of positivity in
febrile persons.  This contrasts with the poorer performance of
case-finding indicated by the ABER, from 7.2% in 1980 to 4.6% in
1990.  Indeed there was a 15% reduction in case-finding (active and
passive) that is also related to the system of reporting,
participation of the health services, and an active search on the
part of the operational personnel, which yielded just 31% of total
cases detected.  Based on the total population of the country
estimated in 1980, the API was 2.83 per 1,000 population; its
lowest point was in 1982, when it fell to 1.14 per 1,000
population.  In 1990 it was back up to 2.69 per 1,000 population.
BRAZIL 

     The population of the country, estimated for 1990, came to
154,235,703 inhabitants, of which 67,341,152 (43.7%) are considered
to live in originally malarious areas; 43,492,501 of latter group
(64.6%) live in areas where the transmission of malaria has been
interrupted.  The rest of the population, i.e. 23,848,651 people,
(35.4%) live in areas where transmission continues.

     In 1990, 560,396 cases of malaria were registered; of these,
252,191 were caused by P.  falciparum, 308,184 by P.  vivax, and
21 by P.  malariae.  These data show a reduction in malaria cases
since 1989 (577,520), and the decline of P.  falciparum in the
parasitic form.  

     Of the three macro-regions into which the country can be
divided, the region with the greatest transmission is the Official
Amazonia, which encompasses nine states and territories:  Acre,
Amapá, Amazonas, MaranhØo, Mato Grosso, Pará, Rondonia, Roraima,
and Tocantíns.  This region has moist tropical forests, very heavy
rainfall, and high temperatures, and is mostly near sea level.  The
states of the official Amazonia account for nearly 99% of all
malaria cases.  The main vector species is A.  darlingi, but
malaria parasites have been found in other species of mosquitoes.

     The three states that accounted for most malaria transmission
in the Amazon region in 1990 were Rondonia (33.4%), Pará (20.1%),
and Mato Grosso (25.0%).  The analysis by municipalities showed
that 30 of the nation's 2,278 municipalities, all located in the
endemic area, accounted for 67.2% of the cases.  These
municipalities include 6.46% of the national population and 11.03%
of the malarious area.

     One could observe that during the year the trend in the states
of Mato Grosso and Roraima was upward, while in the other states
malaria incidence declined.  The increase in malaria cases in Mato
Grosso is due mainly to increased mining in the northern part of
this state; in Roraima rising incidence of malaria continues to
stem from the arrival of miners to regions where access is
difficult.

     The rest of the country can be divided into two regions with
little malaria transmission.  The northeast region is arid and
semiarid; it includes the states of Bahia, Ceará, Paraiba,
Pernambuco, Piauí, Rio Grande do Norte, and Sergipe.  It is also
characterized by high temperatures and is periodically afflicted
by long droughts.  The southern region is made up of the states of
Espíritu Santo, Goiás, Mato Grosso do Sul, Minas Gerais, Paraná,
Rio de Janeiro, Rio Grande do Sul, Santa Catarina, and SØo Paulo,
and the Federal District.  This is the most developed region of the
country, and has a temperate climate.  Some local areas have
experienced outbreaks of malaria, such as in early 1989 at Foz de
IguaÛú, in the state of Paraná.  This resulted mainly from growth
of the A.  darlingi population in the area, and the migration of
malarious persons from the states of the Amazonia.  In 1990, this
outbreak was contained by control measures carried out by the three
countries affected (Brazil, Argentina, and Paraguay).  In 1989 more
than 1,000 autochthonous cases were detected on the Brazilian side,
while in 1990 only 200 cases were detected there.

Causes Affecting the Persistence of Malaria

     The states that account for most malaria cases, particularly
in the official Amazonia, constitute the two "great frontiers" that
exist in this area.  The first frontier is the mining area with the
presence of garimpeiros (miners), who come from remote areas of the
Amazon region in search of gold, cassiterite, and other minerals. 
Most of these garimpeiros live in subsistence conditions, without
walls and with only improvised shelter.

     Control activities in these areas are very precarious due to
the difficult access, which is predominantly by private or rented
airplane.  In the state of Pará the national control agency (SUCAM)
initiated activities known as "microzonage."  In each microzone a
guard is placed who serves a segment of the population in a
specific area.  Yet despite the difficulties, the migratory flow
continues in large numbers, since the garimpeiros move continually
from one locality to another.  In the closed garimpos, or mining
sites, such as Serra Pelada in the state of Pará, malaria was never
a serious problem, due to the control activities of the government. 
In this case control was kept of who was coming and leaving.  In
contrast, in the open garimpos no type of control is exercised.

     The mining activities destroy the ecological balance, since
the mining mechanisms are totally predatory, destroying the forest
through the complete deforestation of extensive areas, and
diverting small watercourses, which become stagnant with the
reconfiguration of land use.  Thus pools and water holes are formed
that become vector breeding sites.  The region's very heavy
rainfall contributes to the formation and maintenance of breeding
sites and spreads them over time.  Separating gold with the
assistance of mercury has polluted the rivers; the fish become so
contaminated that they cannot be consumed.  Direct contamination
of the garimpeiros with mercury is also a problem.

     The second frontier expanding malaria transmission in the
Amazon region is the agricultural frontier, which is most
predominant in the states of Acre and Rondonia.  In these frontier
areas, the colonists inhabit lands that are often inaccessible
during rainy periods.  In the first years these colonists devote
most of their time to clearing land and planting subsistence
harvests, devoting little time or effort to building rooms with
walls.  As a result, they live in houses without walls or with
incomplete walls.

     The state of Rondonia accounted for more than 31.1% of total
cases in the country, although there was a reduction of 23.5% with
respect to 1989.

     The state of Acre is divided into 12 municipalities, four of
which reported 95% of malaria cases in 1990.  The other
municipalities produced 687 cases in the entire year.  The
municipality of Rio Branco is among the 30 municipalities with
highest incidence of malaria nationwide, while the municipality of
Plácido de Castro produces almost as many cases, and has the
highest API in the state (198.9 per 1,000).  The municipality of
Senador Guiomard has an API of 101.9 per 1,000 population.  The 4
municipalities that generate most of the cases are also those with
the highest APIs in the state.

     The state of Amapá is divided into nine municipalities, three
of which accounted for 81% of malaria cases in 1990.  The other
municipalities registered 2,074 cases in the entire year.  The
municipality of Macapá is among the 30 with highest incidence of
malaria nationwide.  The municipality of Tartarugal has the highest
API (125 per 1,000); the other municipalities, with the exception
of Laranjal do Jari, have high API, ranging from 25 to 90.

     The state of Amazonas is divided into 62 municipalities.  Ten
had a higher incidence of malaria, accounting for 62% of all cases
registered in 1990.  Of the 30 municipalities with the highest
incidence of malaria in the country, Manaus has the lowest API, 5.2
per 1,000, due to the large population of this municipality, which
is also the state capital.  Of the other 61 municipalities, three
have an API greater than 100, two of them (Apuí and Barcelos) have
the greatest incidence of malaria in the state, and 19 have an API
ranging from 25 to 99 per 1,000 population.

     The state of Maranhao is divided into 136 municipalities.  The
10 with the greatest incidence of malaria generated less than 50%
of the malaria cases registered in 1990.  Only the municipality of
Imperatriz is among the 30 with highest incidence of malaria of the
country, with an API of 13.0.  The municipality of Pindare Mirim
registered the highest API, 26.8 per 1,000 population, while the
other municipalities have an API of less than 22 per 1,000.

     The state of Mato Grosso is divided into 22 municipalities. 
The 10 with greatest incidence generated less than 92% of malaria
cases in 1990.  Nine of these are among the 30 with greatest
incidence of malaria, with APIs ranging from 129 per 1,000
population to 3,924 per 1,000.  The APIs of the other
municipalities of the state are lower; the lowest API is 20 per
1,000 population.

     The state of Pará is divided into 105 municipalities.  The 10
with the greater incidence of malaria accounted for 66% of all
cases registered in the state.  Five are among the 30 with greatest
incidence of malaria in the country; all have an API  ranging from
26.6 to 583.8 per 1,000 inhabitants.  Some of the municipalities
in this state did not report cases during 1990.

     The state of Rondonia is divided into 23 municipalities.  The
10 with the highest incidence of malaria generated 90% of the cases
state-wide.  Seven are among the 30 municipalities with the highest
incidence of malaria nationwide; in two the API was greater than
100 per 1,000 population.

     The state of Roraima is divided into eight municipalities. 
The five with the greatest incidence of malaria generated
approximately 95% of the cases in the state.  One, Boa Vista, is
among the 30 municipalities with greatest incidence of malaria in
the country.  Boa Vista's API was 79.5 per 1,000.  The APIs of
three municipalities were greater than 100; the other ranged from
14 per 1,000 to 93 per 1,000.

     The state of Tocantíns is divided into 80 municipalities.  The
10 municipalities with the greatest incidence of malaria generated
62% of the cases.  Three had an API ranging from 25 to 68 per
1,000, while in the others it was less than 17 per 1,000.  Some did
not report any cases of malaria during the year.  None of the
municipalities of Tocantíns is among those with the highest
incidence the country.

     Migrations of colonists and miners are also responsible for
the occurrence and re-establishment of malaria in other regions of
the country where transmission had been interrupted.

     In some cases, urban transmission is still a serious problem
in the Amazon region.  In localities such as Porto Velho, capital
of Rondînia, the incidence of urban transmission has been reduced
with the use of adulticides, in ULV, applied weekly.  In contrast,
in the city of Manaus, where urban transmission was interrupted in
1974, transmission was reestablished in 1989, with the expansion
of the city.  Efforts have been made in the area to reduce sources
of transmission in some peripheral neighborhoods. 

     One of the major deficits the country is facing is in manpower
training, particularly in the areas of epidemiology, entomology,
and vector control.  During the year several courses were developed
and prepared to enhance personnel in these areas.  In the cities
of Belém, Pará, and Manaus, Amazonas, 15 persons participated (two
from abroad, one from Colombia and one from Portugal) in the
"International Course of Malariology"; it lasted three months.  A
course on medical entomology was also offered, in Rio de Janeiro,
with a duration of one month.  Another course was given on
Entomology in Public Health and Vector Control for upper-level
personnel in Manaus, Amazonas, of three months duration, with the
participation of 12 students, one of who came from abroad
(Ecuador).  
Malaria Control in International Border Areas

      Among the existing international agreements with other
countries is the Southern Cone Pact, which includes Argentina,
Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Paraguay, and Uruguay.  Malaria is endemic
only in Paraguay, Bolivia, and Brazil, and in a small part of
northern Argentina.  In intercountry technical meetings it was
recommended that exchange actions be increased in the areas of
human resources, research, epidemiological surveillance,
documentation, and acquisition and supply of inputs, material and
equipment, in order to obtain effective and lasting control of
disease.
COLOMBIA

     The status of malaria has gradually and continuously worsened. 
Even though it is considered one of the country's health
priorities, the results of control efforts have not been
satisfactory, and prevalence of the disease has increased over the
last ten years.

     The Bureau of Direct Campaigns (DCD) registered a total of
99,489 malaria cases in 1990, of which 35,322 (35.5%) were
diagnosed as P.  falciparum.

     The greatest transmission of malaria continues to occur in the
Pacific Coast, Lower Cauca, Urabá, Amazon, Sarare, and Middle
Magdalena regions.  In these six regions 79,962 cases of malaria
were detected in 74 municipalities, accounting for 80.4% of the
99,489 cases registered in the country.  Of these 74
municipalities, 28 registered 64,735 cases, equivalent to 65.1% of
the national total, and 80.9% of all cases detected in the six
regions.

     However, the limited number of localities in the malarious
area that have information (4,629) is noteworthy; this represents
only 12% of the total number of localities in the malarious area. 
No information was received from the remaining 87.9% of the
localities.

     In contrast, the Sectional Health Service of Antioquia
reported mortality due to malaria at two per 100,000 population,
which represents a very significant reduction, compared to the
figure for 1983 of 34 per 100,000 population, and 1984, 19 per
100,000 population.  This reduction is the fruit of actions carried
out by the Sectional Health Service since 1984, based on diagnosis
and timely treatment.  The Health Service of Antioquia also
reported taking 211,826 blood samples, in which it detected 80,936
malaria cases in 1990.

     In summary, the malaria situation in Colombia had the
following characteristics:

     Stability in the 1988-1990 period, with approximately 100,000
cases per year.  Slight reduction in infections due to P. 
falciparum in the regions of Sarare, Catatumbo, the Orinoco river
basin, and the Amazon basin, and a deterioration of that situation
in the Pacific Coast, Urabá, Lower Cauca-Nechí, and Upper Sinú
regions.

     There is considerable underregistration of mortality due to
malaria.  In some communities of the Pacific Coast there have been
findings of up to 20% apparently healthy carriers, with confirmed
parasitemia.

     Of all cases registered in 1990, 46% were detected in 13
municipalities, and 18% in three of these.  Of the total of cases
by P.  falciparum in 1990, 50% were concentrated in eight
municipalities; of these, four accounted for 38% of the cases
registered.

     Infections by P.  falciparum of the An.  darlingi, An.
albimanus, and An. neomacutipalpus, and by P. vivax of the An.
albimanus and An. rangeli, were detected using immunological
methods. 

Causes Affecting the Persistence of Malaria

     Reservoir-related factors.  Large concentrations of population
in newly-occupied tropical colonization zones have established new
human settlements that do not have the health services required for
care delivery.  In addition to the foregoing are the different
types of migrations specific to agricultural, stock-raising, and
mining activities; problems of public order, which limit the areas
in which timely control measures can be taken; and the risk factors
associated with the physical environment (very heavy rainfall and
relative moisture, and high temperatures).

     Other factors to be considered have to do with the knowledge,
attitudes, practices and behavior of the population in relation to
their ecological and cultural adaptation to factors that alter
susceptibility and degree of exposure to the risk of malaria.

     The hemorrhagic dengue emergency in 1990 caused a major
reduction in the activities programmed for malaria control at the
national level, due to the diversion of resources to address that
emergency.

Decentralization

     In accordance with the provisions of Law 10 of 10 January
1990, the offices and respective employment of the current Bureau
of Direct Campaigns (DCD) should be assumed by national or
territorial entities.  Accordingly, the municipal governments must
assume responsibility for the actions to control malaria and other
vector-borne diseases (VBD).  The process of decentralization
called for in that law has been initiated by the Bureau of Direct
Campaigns through a survey of the epidemiological situation in each
community (locality) over the last five years, reviewing the
résumés of each staff member; taking stock of resources, especially
lots, buildings, and transportation; and assessing resources
available and human resources needed for the operational levels in
the municipalities.  

     In addition, workshops and meetings were held with mayors of
the municipalities, in which malaria was examined as a problem in
the framework established through the creation of the Committees
for Community Participation.  

Epidemiological Stratification

     The process of stratification in Colombia has made it possible
to identify and group the areas with the greatest transmission of
malaria, using as the principal indicators the annual parasite
incidence (API) and the annual P.  falciparum incidence (AFI).

     The utilization of these two indicators has made possible
improved use of resources, which are concentrated in those areas
where the API is highest.  Three levels of risk have been
established based on API:  below 0.5, low risk; 0.5-10.0, medium
risk; and greater than 10.0, high risk.

     In the area where control actions are focused, which is
considered high-risk, 94,190 cases of malaria were registered in
1990, for an API of 17.8 per 1,000 population.

     In the low-risk area (area being consolidated), 5,299 cases
were diagnosed, for an API of 0.3 per 1,000.  This situation
reflects the knowledge available as to the magnitude and intensity
of malaria transmission in Colombia.  However, identification of
the risk factors at the local level is still deficient.

Malaria Control in International Border Areas

     Together with the armed forces of the bordering countries,
periodic visits continued to the populations of the localities
located along the shores of the Putumayo and Amazon rivers, as part
of the Civic-Naval Plan of Action.  In addition, as a result of the
Colombian-Venezuelan border meetings, joint actions with Venezuela
were carried out for malaria control in the Sarare and Catatumbo
regions.

     In the region of the Putumayo river, along the border with
Ecuador, the problem of malaria has been reduced by actions agreed
upon in border meetings.  This region has a network of
microscopists, thus reducing the time between taking samples and
their diagnosis, and between diagnosis and treatment.
COSTA RICA 

     The principal objective of the Malaria Program in Costa Rica
was to consolidate the process of interrupting the disease in the
national territory.

     The malarious area of the country includes 35,446 km2, which
represents 69.6% of the country's area, and a population of
835,485.  In 1990, 113,167 blood samples were examined, of which
1,151 were positive (1,146 P.  vivax, and 5 P.  falciparum).

     The epidemiological analysis indicates that the most affected
provinces were Limón, with 779 cases; Alajuela, with 105; and
Guanacaste, with 92.  These account for 85% of total cases in the
country, and resulted from epidemic outbreaks.  Of the 1,151 cases
registered, 117 were classified as imported from abroad, with 107
from Nicaragua, three from Panama, one from Honduras, two from
Guatemala, two from Colombia, one from India, and one from Brazil.

Causes Affecting the Persistence of Malaria

      One of the cantons that is most problematic due to the
dispersion and persistence of transmission is Limón, with 280
cases, most of which were in areas of difficult access and/or where
there has been migration.

     The most recent outbreak was in the canton of Siquirres, with
221 cases.  This area is suffering drastic changes due to the
presence of unstable and scattered populations, and also due to the
reactivation of banana-growing on many farms.

     The prevailing climatological conditions also favored
increased transmission in the area, making control measures
difficult.  In many cases treatment had to be interrupted due to
continuous high waters and floods.  The excessive rain during the
year facilitated the increase in anopheline density,  which
established transmission in places where it had already been
interrupted.

Malaria Control in International Border Areas

      With a view to preventing malaria and dengue in the border
region between Costa Rica and Nicaragua, a cooperation agreement
was signed with the Governments of Sweden and Finland in August
1988.  This facilitated the joint work, with coordination of tasks
not only for malaria and dengue control, but also for the primary
care program.  In this context shared goals were established,
common problems identified, and coherent solutions devised to
address local health problems with available resources.

     In August 1990 the proposal for financing the Second Phase of
the Project for Strengthening the Operational Capacity of the Local
Level of Health Care was prepared; it is based on the prevention
and control of vector-borne diseases in border areas between Costa
Rica and Honduras, and Costa Rica and Nicaragua.

     The Basic Technical Councils (local health systems) are
responsible for carrying out activities at the local level,
including surveillance and control of malaria, dengue, and A. 
aegypti.  The upper levels of coordination are constituted by the
Regional Technical Councils.  This regional and local structure is
supported by the normative programs of the central level.

     The actions carried out in 1990 were set forth in the context
of the policies and strategies defined in these by the health
program component of the National Plan for Economic and Social
Development for 1990-1994. 
ECUADOR 

     Ecuador reported 71,690 cases of malaria, of which 21,871 were
infections by P.  falciparum (30.5%).  Of these cases, 91.5%
occurred in the provinces of Esmeraldas, Manabi, Guayas, and Los
Ríos.  This area constitutes the new frontier of development in
Ecuador; it includes new zones vital for agriculture and mining.

     This characteristic is reinforced by the continuity of the
greatest prevalence of P.  falciparum in the Province of Esmeraldas
along in the border with Colombia along the Pacific coast, where
40% of all cases of P.  falciparum were registered.  However, the
classical scenario of high prevalence changed in the valley of the
Napo river in the Amazon region, where the number of cases declined
to 15% of the total.
EL SALVADOR

     Again, for the third consecutive year, the transmission of
malaria continues diminishing in El Salvador.  In 1990, only 9,269
cases were registered.  Infections by P.  falciparum are the lowest
figures ever registered, with 18 cases, or 0.2% of all cases
diagnosed in 1990.

     Since 1980, when the highest figures of malaria were detected
(96,000 cases, including 16,000 by P.  falciparum), the situation
has improved continuously for 11 years.  Thus there was a 90%
reduction in the number of cases in general, and in the specific
case of P.  falciparum, a 99.8% reduction.

     These achievements resulted from the development of an of
integrated control strategy, with a purely epidemiological
approach, based on stratification of the problem and its constant
adaptation to the evolving malaria situation.  This required the
development of a computerized information system for immediate
decision-making.  In addition to the foregoing, the
decentralization of diagnosis at the rural level and by local
medical services made possible more timely treatment of cases. 
Finally, training of the program personnel, the 2,700 voluntary
collaborators, the health services personnel, and others involved
has been extremely valuable in developing the aforementioned
strategy.
GUATEMALA 

     In Guatemala, during the 1959-1976 period, there were an
average of 10,325 malaria cases annually; from 1977 to 1990 this
number increased to 57,274 cases.

     During 1990 total malaria cases came to 41,711, which was a
decline of 742 cases (1.7%) with respect to the 42,453 diagnosed
in 1989.  The 305,791 blood examinations done in 1990 declined by
26.01% and 8.0% with regard to those done in 1988 and 1989,
respectively.

     Annual parasite incidence (API) was 4.54 per 1,000 population
in the country, very similar to that of 1989 (4.75 per 1,000).  The
distribution by parasitic species of the 41,711 cases was 40,703
(97.6%) cases of P.  vivax, 890 (2.1%) of P.  falciparum, and 118
(0.3%) mixed infections.

     In the distribution of cases by health regions, it was
observed that Regions II, VI, and VIII contributed 12,438 (30.1%),
7,986 (17.0%), and 5,567 (13.0%) cases respectively.  In sum, these
three regions accounted for 25,991 cases, or 62.3% of the total
registered in the country.  These same regions contributed a
similar percentage (59.0%) in 1989.  Of 22 departments, five (El
Petén, Alta Verapaz, Escuintla, Izabal, and El Quiché) accounted
for 67.6% of total cases in the country.  In El Petén, Alta
Verapaz, San Marcos, and El Quiché the APIs were above average.  

     In the distribution of malaria by ecological areas, the
northern ecological area registered 25,314 cases, which or 60.6%
of the total.  This area encompasses 55,210 km2, i.e. 50.7% of the
national territory, and a population of 1,050,468 inhabitants
(1967), or 11.7% of the country's total population.  The high
receptivity of this area is a consequence of the favorable
climatological factors, such as the abundant rainfall and average
temperature of 25o C.  An. albimanus is the principal vector,
although An. pseudopunctipennis and An. vestitipennis are also
present.

     In addition to the ecological factors, there are migratory
movements that affect the agrarian development of the region and
contribute to disorganized colonization, with unprotected
dwellings, mainly in the departments of Alta Verapaz and El Petén.
Sociopolitical problems are present in most of the departments of
the northern area, hindering adequate epidemiological surveillance
and implementation of the respective control measures.  There are
also other factors, such as inaccessibility, distance to the
localities, and lack of resources and equipment in good condition.

     The southern ecological area has conditions that are very
propitious for malaria transmission, especially in the coastal
strip, at 400 meters above sea level.  The region, with 11,471 km2,
is not all that extensive; it comprises 10.5% of the national
territory.  Yet it is the most densely populated, with 1,109,158
inhabitants, or 12.05% of the total population.  The topography is
flat and with abundant rivers; the principal vector is the An.
albimanus.

     In this area over the 10 last years the malaria problem has
diminished considerably.

     Possible explanations have been given to account for this,
such as the suppression of cotton and banana crops, and the
predominance of sugarcane.  This has contributed to a reduction in
internal rural migrations and the indiscriminate use of
insecticides.

     The eastern central ecological area includes 13,864 km2, which
is 13.0% of the total area of the country, and has a population of
1,269,601 (1987), or 14.0% of the total population.  This area is
characterized by high temperatures, little precipitation, and low
relative moisture, in addition to a broken topography with little
vegetation.  The irrigation systems are the main source promoting
and maintaining breeding sites of the An.  albimanus.

     This area is characterized by its high vulnerability due to
the constant flow of population to and from El Salvador.  However,
this epidemiological situation is offset by the area's low
receptivity.

Epidemiological Stratification

     The Malaria Division has used stratification, drawing on the
annual parasite incidence (API, per 1,000) as an instrument for
identifying priority areas.  Thus the malarious area has been
divided into two major groups of municipalities:  a) those that
account for 80.0% of the cases; and, b) those in the remaining
20.0%.

     The group a) municipalities, in turn, are subdivided into
three strata:  a) localities with an API greater than 100; b)
localities with an API from 50 per 1,000 to 99.9 per 1,000; c)
localities with an API under 49.9 cases per 1,000 population.  This
approach has made possible the improved use of available resources.

     Having determined this stratification based on API, the next
steps are to:  a) identify and measure the risk factors; b)
determine the epidemiological strata; c) select the principal
measures of intervention; and, d) ensure participation of health
services in implementing the actions.  For example, the services
of the Ministry of Healt
