Component 3:  Education

      Basic professional formation and updating, as well as the education and
training of personnel involved in the management of drugs, from prescribers
to dispensers, are decisive factors in the rational use of drugs. 
Accordingly, the project includes activities in this area for both the public
and the private sectors.

      One of the activities envisaged is the introduction or strengthening,
depending on the case, of the concepts of essential drugs and the rational
use of drugs as part of the basic formation of professionals in medicine,
pharmacy, and nursing.  This activity includes a review of academic programs
in pharmacology, clinical pharmacology, and/or pharmacotherapy.  The names as
well as the content of these programs will vary in the different professions
cited and even betweeen different schools within a single profession.  For
this reason, and because it is desired to include studies on drug therapy for
patients, all the possible variants are mentioned.  The review will focus on
building the concept of essential drugs and the practice of rational drug use
into the teaching-learning process.

      By the same token, the project also includes a review and adaptation of
basic curricula for forming the professions cited above.  Since much of the
responsibility for the rational use of drugs rests with the act of
prescribing, and since the medical professional is the person who officially
and most often performs this act, the project includes participation in
curriculum reform for medical studies, to be undertaken in the context of
other projects, with a view to supporting the needed changes in the
teaching-learning process that have been noted in the paragraph above.

     The foregoing notwithstanding, the project also includes significant
support for revision and adaptation of the pharmacy curriculum in view of the
fact that this profession requires a comprehensive overhaul in order to meet
the demands of present-day society--a process not currently supported by any
other project in the area.  It should be pointed out that this is not only a
Central American reality but a regional one, as revealed in the analysis of
pharmaceutical education carried out in 1990 under the auspices of PAHO.

      In addition, in view of the fact that the prescribing and dispensing of
drugs in many health institutions in the different countries comes under the
responsibility of auxiliary nursing personnel, health promoters, or pharmacy
auxiliaries, the project also plans to develop educational activities aimed
at improving the level of knowledge of such personnel so that their
participation in this area will be more effective.

      The project also includes, following a needs and feasibility study, the
systematization of training activities in specific areas of continuing
education, plus training designed to promote the needed integration of
teaching and service.  Of special importance is training dealing with
clinical pharmacology and drug treatment for selected groups, with a view to
promoting a reorientation of prescribing patterns through the more rational
use of drugs.  This activity is closely tied in with the utilization studies
and the evaluation of prescribing practices at the institutional level under
Component 2 of the project.

      It is important to point out that the activities under this component
are directed not only toward personnel who work in the public sector but
also, insofar as they focus on the teaching institutions, toward the private
sector, not only because they involve the basic formation of the individual
but also, in many cases, because such personnel participate in both sectors
and because the programs will also include professionals who are exclusively
engaged in private practice.  This process will emphasize the involvement of
unions in the process as strengtheners and multiplier agents.

Report.  Guatemala, August 1991.

 

ACUTE RESPIRATORY INFECTIONS


During the 1994-1995 biennium priority will be placed on the development of two
components of ARI control:  activities at the local health service level and research.


HEALTH SERVICES


The Program has focused initially on the development and distribution of technical standards
and materials that will help the countries to establish national ARI control programs within the
primary health care system, including training courses for national program coordinators, standards
of case management, a treatment manual for physicians and supervisors, technical outlines,
audiovisual aids, and bibliographies.  In addition, steps have been taken to establish ARI training
units (ATUs) to provide clinical training in the treatment of ARI in the developing countries. 
Methodologies are being developed for the monitoring and evaluation of both the Regional Program
and the national programs.  Efforts in this connection include the preparation of manuals for surveys
on morbidity from ARI, practices that are followed in the home for the treatment of patients, and
clinical practices in health facilities.  Another important aspect of case management is the
surveillance of drug resistance of the principal bacterial agents that cause pneumonia.  A manual
containing recommended surveillance procedures is currently being developed.


Work will continue on the development of ARI control activities at the local health service
level through:

-            Consolidation of the updated PAHO/WHO guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment
of ARI in all the countries of the Region.

-            Advice on the preparation of national operational plans for ARI control, including all
the components--training, monitoring, supervision, and provision of supplies and
drugs--in the context of the comprehensive health care for children.

-            Support for national courses in the organization of ARI programs and courses at the
state or provincial level in supervisory abilities in ARI control.

-            Promotion of training activities with educators in the pediatrics departments of schools
of medicine and nursing.  This will be a joint effort carried out in collaboration with the
Program on CDD.


RESEARCH


The research component is intended to strengthen the scientific bases of the Program and
determine the best means of applying available knowledge and implementing control strategies at
the country level.  Research priorities to be promoted during the biennium include:  (i) clinical
research to determine the most reliable signs and symptoms for the diagnosis of pneumonia and
other serious cases of sepsis of bacterial origin during the first months of life, as well as to identify
better criteria for the diagnosis of pneumonia in infants and children; (ii) behavioral research to
determine the knowledge, attitudes, and practices of families in relation to the recognition of
pneumonia, the decision to seek outside help, home treatment of ARI, and adherence to the
recommended treatment regimen; (iii) health systems research to evaluate the cost and
effectiveness of the case management strategy when it is applied in selected national ARI programs,
with a view to evaluating drug use in ARI control programs and defining effective communication
strategies to promote early recognition of pneumonia; and (iv) research on disease prevention,
particularly field tests in the developing countries to determine the effectiveness of new vaccines
against the principal bacterial agents that cause pneumonia in infants and young children.



ACTIVITIES TO BE CARRIED OUT DURING THE 1994-1995 BIENNIUM                                                                               


i.           Support for the countries in the preparation and later follow-up of the implementation
of a National Plan for the ARI Control Program, with special emphasis on evaluation
of the epidemiological impact and the process.

ii.          Incorporation of ARI control activities into the existing health structures of every
country.

iii.         Integration of pharmacists, practitioners of traditional medicine, and other segments
of society into the Program so that, in coordination with the public sector, they can
participate in the execution of activities under the ARI Control Program.

iv.          Strengthening of the coordination of National ARI Control Programs with pediatrics
societies, clinical and public health physicians, and schools of medicine and nursing
with a view to disseminating the standard case management strategy as well as
general information about the Control Program and encouraging the incorporation
thereof into curricula for the formation of health personnel.

v.           Provision of theoretical and practical training for all categories of health workers at
the first level in standard management of ARI cases in children, as well as in the
development of supervisory skills and the organization of national control programs
in all the countries of the Region of the Americas.

vi.          An effort will also be made to extend training in standard ARI case management to
health personnel in the private sector and social security institutions, as well as to the
NGOs that carry out activities in the countries.  Activities to train community health
workers will be initiated once the health workers in the public and private sectors have
received their training.

vii.         The Plans of Action should firmly support self-sufficiency in the procurement of
antimicrobial agents and other supplies for standardized case management in the
countries, as well as the coordination of National ARI Control Programs with the
National Program on Essential Drugs.

viii.        The communication component is crucial to the success of the National ARI Control
Program, since it will play a key role in the education of mothers and other persons
who care for children in regard to home treatment of children with ARI.  In this
connection, it will be important to carry out research on the knowledge, beliefs, and
practices of families with regard to ARI, as well as to develop, test, and evaluate
communication materials.

INTRODUCTION

      During 1991, the PAHO Program on Women, Health, and
Development promoted a number of scientific and cultural activities
in the Region aimed at dissemination, study, discussion, and
analysis, especially on topics pertaining to the health of women. 
In general, all these activities employed gender studies as their
theoretical referent, enriching the discussions in the consultative
groups, seminars, workshops, and conferences held throughout the
year in Latin America.

     In particular, the Working Group which met in Cali, Colombia,
from 6-8 November 1991 on the subject of "Women, Health, and Self-
care" brought new dimensions to the concept of self-care, and
contributed to rethinking the meaning of health based on the
knowledge and feelings of the women and men consulted.

     The meeting was enriched by the diverse origins of the
participants.  Those present included poets, artists, painters,
community representatives, communicators, sociologists,
psychologists, sexologists, public health specialists, nurses,
physicians, educators, anthropologists, demographers, social
workers, and lawyers--a group of women and men from 14 countries of
the Americas.  They worked in a joyful setting, surrounded by
nature, a setting which contributed greatly to fostering the various
working dynamics in which participation, creativity, and
companionship created a solid foundation for intellectual activity
and attainment of the goals projected by the Organization.

     The central theme of the gathering--"self-care in women's
health"--was set forth in a crucial discussion dealing with theories
of development, social participation, social medicine, and gender. 
In recent years these theories have incorporated new concepts that
give priority to the subject of women.  Such themes as women's
historically marginalized position in economic, social, cultural,
and political terms; their exclusion from public life and from the
locus of power and decision-making; their maternal function, which
takes on overwhelming dimensions and is turned into the object of a
medical practice concerned mainly with biology; their image of
submission, weakness, fragility, and subordination gave the Working
Group ample subject for debate and for an analysis of the various
phenomena that circumscribe, limit, and restrict the lives of women.

     In light of current theories that have opened a dialogue about
human development, about democratic participation within civilian
society, and about the concept of health from a perspective which
values the right of women to their own lives and to make decisions
on both public and private matters, the proposed study of self-
care had special implications.  It meant, first of all, the opening
of a field of study that can strengthen efforts to achieve new
sociocultural dimensions in women's health.  Secondly, it implied
steps to reformulate the concept of self-care (traditionally
directed toward the short-term management of health problems,
usually related to surgery or chronic diseases) by valuing the
woman's self-determination, self-esteem, and autonomy, making her
the actor in a primary plan of intervention and decision-making. 
Third, it implied an effort to maximize the social and human
development of women in light of demands for their rights and
liberation, their differences as a gender group, and their full
participation in the protection of their own health.


1. PARTICIPANTS:  WHO WAS INVITED?


     As mentioned previously, this event, facilitated by PAHO's
Program on Women, Health, and Development, fit within the
comprehensive Work Plan developed in 1991.  In particular, the
subject of self-care required an approach that would articulate it
to the discussions of gender.  There was a need for fresh views and
opinions, as well as renewed challenges and commitments tied to
paradigms that assert principles of equality, democracy, and dignity
among human beings.

     The convocation was issued to women and men who, in one way or
another, have promoted in their home regions efforts related to
development on a human scale, social participation, and social
medicine; to members of women's movements; to representatives of
international organizations, state agencies, and nongovernmental
organizations; to experts in the mass communications media; to
persons involved in alternative forms of health care; to feminist
spokespersons; to artists who explore the subject of women in their
art; and to government officials responsible for defining policies
related to women's health and implementing programs of service.

     In particular, Colombia's Minister of Health Camilo González
Posso enriched the discussions with his frank, informal, open, and
spontaneous remarks.

     The following excerpt from the Minister's statements is of
special note:

Self-care in women's health has a social and cultural
dimension.  It is not simply an individual matter, as one
might assume; it does not mean that each woman takes
responsibility for her own health, but rather that
responsibility lies in the hands of a social movement of
men and women, under the leadership of women, in support
of women's health.  It relies on the family, on self-
management, and on self-determination; it is a movement,
it is a force that is unleashed for the purpose of
transforming a history of oppression, of inequality, and
of privileges nurtured by "machismo," among other things,
and grounded in a diverse array of structures ...

When we talk about leadership, we are referring to the
social recognition of these structures and also of the
distribution of power in society.  A thesis I think it
important to point out is that the formation of that
social force, of that social movement and that new
leadership of women, can be a crucial component of a new
policy.  I believe that it is work for an
interdisciplinary team of women and men attempting to
reformulate policies regarding women.

     The foregoing political points and the reflections generated in
the working groups comprised a rich body of theoretical material
that, jointly with the proposals for intervention aimed at health
protection and the use of self-care measures, could in the near
future become part of the Action Plan of PAHO's Program on Women,
Health, and Development in the Region of the Americas.


2.   METHODOLOGY:  HOW WAS THE MEETING CARRIED OUT?


     The gathering employed the "working group" modality.  It was
believed that this framework would facilitate collective
participation based on the diverse disciplines, experience,
knowledge, and views of the participants.  It drew in the subjective
aspects, sensitivity, and personal histories of those present. 
Health was not considered solely in rational terms, but also in
relation to feelings, the complexity of human beings, and the
specific experience of women.  Expression of feeling took place
through music, poetry, and the recovery of words describing
tenderness, love, desires, and emotions.

     The musical and poetic interludes created playful moments which
were supremely enriching and which helped to express the cultural
diversity of Latin America as represented by the participants at the
meeting.  The theme of self-care came out especially strongly in
those songs and verses which, like the following, were written by
the male participants from Cuba, Bolivia, and Colombia:
From all the countries            From all the countries   
They've come to speak         Good people have come
About self-care               All have experience
They cannot be silent.             To speak to this theme.

For three days running             After all the discussions
Everyone on this hill         About self-care
Has worked most seriously     The male contingent
Imagine how the hormones feel      Has been quite transformed

Talking about the concept     Self-care, self-esteem
Opinions were aired                And self-affirmation
It's sure that our hearts     Self-consciousness, self-pride
Are moved by self-care.            And self-transformation.

Each group always had         Would it not be better
Someone to serve as reporter       To change the term self-care
What onerous work!                 So that its rich meaning
Applause is in order.         Will not be so limited?

When I hear so many women speakThis group of women
about self-care               Is a bouquet of flowers
My heart leaps                     Self-care became
When they pass by my side.    a waterfall of love

Self-care, self-esteem             They call us machista
Concept and definition             Sexist and sly
For these three days          Can't they see
What impressive discussion!        Through to our hearts?

Women are the majority here        We men also have
We men are few                     Emotions and sweetness
Thanks to self-care                Affection, warmth, feelings
Our energies were spared.     Love, passion, and tenderness.

     Reflections on the human body and recognition of its vitality
and need for care also contributed to creating an atmosphere of
affectionate, spontaneous, and informal relations.  One of the
female participants who supervised the practice of self-massage
said:  "The recovery, improvement, and well-being of our bodies are
among the rights of women.  Care of our physical and mental health
must be based on a collective questioning of what is happening to us
and why ... With exercise and with an adequate combination of rest
and silence, the body is strengthened, metabolizes food, resists,
grows, achieves balance, transforms itself, is reborn, is liberated,
and is revitalized."

     The recognition of physical affection, movement, rest, and food
as essential to the harmony of the body was an important reflection
that contributed to understanding the meaning of health and the need
for self-care.  In response to the interest in learning about
practices and exercises for relaxation and pain relief, those
persons who wished to do so programmed extra meetings that became
occasions for learning, closeness, dialogue, and enjoyment through
the practice of self-massage and relaxation.

     The methodology was characterized by the variety of techniques
brought to bear on the different subjects and discussions.  At the
start of the meeting the mood was set by the presentation of a film
on the life of the famous Mexican painter Frida Khalo.  This woman,
who from infancy was marked by pain and by physical limitations due
to an incurable disease, led her life as a painter (she is
recognized today as a leading Mexican cultural figure) focused on
the subject of her own body, which became the "axis of her pictorial
universe."  Her life was a story of political commitments, of love
relationships charged with affection and animosity; she lived every
minute of her existence intensely.  Frida was a woman who faced
constant doubts, conflicts, and contradictions.  One of the
participants at the meeting, a painter and student of the life of
Khalo, commented:


Frida strived for physiological nakedness: feeling
herself, seeing herself, painting herself, fixing herself
in order to accept, love, and cure herself of the rigid
embrace of the corsets, crutches, and canes ... Face to
face with the harsh reality of her tragedy, she dressed
up in the finest traditional clothing of Mexican folk
culture, and in doing so, banished the image of her weak
and shriveled leg.  She adorned herself with pieces of
antique jewelry ... little by little, in the hours she
passed before the mirror, she transformed herself into a
work of art reflecting the various regions and cultures
of Mexico ... Feeling herself the maker of her own
history, as painful as it was ... she becomes color,
owner of her name, vibrating space and although she was
ill, she succeeded in breaking through the walls and
transformed her pain into an all-embracing tolerance of
her different states of health.


     From the standpoint of methodological process, to have started
off the meeting with a film on the real life of a woman like Frida
made it possible to create an atmosphere open to the world of
sensations; it created channels for analysis, discussion, and
reflection on the complex realities involved in human existence.  

     It became possible to rethink the concept of health, using
referents which differ from the rigid scientific theories that blur
the complex world that envelopes a person at her different moments,
in her feelings, in her illnesses, and in her personal realizations.

     Accordingly, the Working Group became increasingly immersed in
the discussion of various matters that bear on women's lives:

     ·    The sensitivity, expressiveness, vitality, and
emotionality rooted in the condition of "being female,"
and socialized through cultural practices that liberate
the woman from her bonds or which, alternatively,
restrict and oppress her.
     
     ·    The sociopolitical events that define a large part of her
options as a social being.

     ·    Romantic relationships carried out amid conflicts,
emotional battles, and choices.

     ·    Experiences linked to alcoholism, smoking, and use of
tranquilizers.

     ·    Pain and feelings of loneliness and abandonment arising
from the loss of loved ones.

     ·    Suffering from disease and its effects on women's bodily
integrity, on their psyches, and on their daily lives.

     ·    Sexuality and its manifestations in terms of the
expressiveness and unique nature of the female being. 
Her need for affection and her various forms of
expression in response to eroticism, sensuality, and
tenderness.

     Together, these reflections provided new angles from which to
rethink the concept of self-care.  The methodology unquestionably
contributed to achieving a collective participation rich with
meaning, solidarity, and commitment.  Various thoughts expressed by
participants reflect the level of dialogue and of sensitivity
attained in the encounter:  "This meeting is taking place in a
different kind of environment, and with a different methodology as
well."  One wonders: what created this environment?  We can say that
in this particular case, several things happened:
 
     First.  It was not an open and unrestricted meeting.  The
people who were invited had prior knowledge of the convocation. It
was not expected that they would prepare papers, nor that an expert
would present his or her work.  The important thing was to have
invited individuals with a commitment to the issue, from different
angles.  It was obvious that these were persons who lived their
work, and lived it with great intensity.  That is, their
professional activities were not only professional, but were linked
to the struggle for women's rights and thus to the validation of
women.  Such persons obviously gave a particular direction to the
meeting.  This was in fact foreseen in designing the methodology,
with successful results since it ensured that the preparations were
not in vain.  These were persons who not only worked in promotion,
but also worked to shake things up, and who had great capacity to be
moved and changed themselves.  These characteristics ensured that
the human input into the workshop rendered it a special event.  An
example was the recital which took place on the second night of the
encounter, featuring poems such as:


My house, my body
I touch you with my hands
soiled by contact
with contradictions.
I come from the night,
I was an accomplice to its lies.
From the bridge I have seen
many dreams drift away, lost 
in the haze of cigarette smoke.
The city was a woman
with red lips and a faded dress
and a clenched heart
after weeping.
My house, my body
the door does not open from within.
The blood trembles still,
while I loosen my sandals
and cast off my clothes.
I want to reach you
stripped of words,
inhabited by silences,
so that you recognize me
and I can then return to you
to my
house
my body

Meisy Correa
Colombian Poet



     Second.  The film presented was well chosen, among other
things because it took into account the particular
characteristics of the audience.  That is, the film touched a
sensitive nerve in people:  it was the story of a woman who
moves in a political world, who is committed to her people,
who is an incredibly emotional person, a person who feels,
who is touched, who is hurt by things, who expresses, who
approaches what she does with great vitality; who lived with
pain in a certain way and who found herself in that pain in
order to create artistic works of great interest.  This
window on the life of Frida Khalo, we might say, in some ways
revealed an image that connected to those present at the
meeting; she was not a strange figure.  She evoked for us
memories of lived images and of ways of seeing the world.  In
this sense the film was a narrative that in some ways
mirrored the situation of those present.  As a result, it
clearly uncovered and unleashed a great deal of
expressiveness in the meeting.  From this perspective the
film was successful; not because it was important to begin
with a film, or because it would be interesting to begin with
an audiovisual, but because in this case, the subject of
Frida Khalo reflected feelings and experiences of the women
and men who were at the meeting.  It touched us; and touching
us, it uncoiled springs within us.  As a consequence the
meeting had, from the outset, an atmosphere of great
expressiveness.

     We begin to express ourselves--after seeing the film--
from different perspectives:  about what we felt, about what
we lived.  From the beginning, therefore, sensitive nerves
were touched which resulted in richer and more creative work
sessions.  The film was a message for many of the women: 
women who are searching, women involved in very specific
work, who are creating, who have moments of solidarity. 
There were identities and images that reflected their own
commitment.  This transformed the nature of the encounter and
acted upon the emotions of the people present.  They began to
speak from their own emotions rather than in purely rational
terms.

     Third.  "We believe it was a good thing that the working
group wa
