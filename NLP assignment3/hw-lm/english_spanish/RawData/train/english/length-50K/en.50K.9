ting out the journal had also taken on the publication of
a Spanish edition of the Chronicle of the World Health Organization
as well as translations of various technical works.  By this time
the Boletín had expanded far beyond its initial length of 26 pages
QUOTE 5
and was publishing many more articles based on original research. 
In 1951 it served as the vehicle for a survey on health education
and in 1953 a new section was added on the subject.  The ideas
explored in this section coincided to a large extent with new
developments in the search for health which were being discussed
at major international congresses.  The Boletín gave increasing
attention to statistics, environmental health, and the health needs
of the elderly, and it began to publish essentially monographic
issues devoted almost exclusively to specific subjects, including
poliomyelitis, malaria, nursing, and medical education, among
others.  In 1953, 1955, and 1959 supplements were published that
included scientific material from the Institute of Nutrition of
Central America and Panama.  A forerunner of the current section
entitled "Communicación biomédica" was Selma Debakey's article on
the preparation of medical articles (October, 1955).
     When Dr. Abraham Horwitz was elected Director of the
Organization, the first Latin American to occupy this position, he
became a frequent contributor of incisive articles and editorials. 
At that time the Boletín was reporting monthly on progress toward
the eradication of Aedes aegypti and had begun to publish the first
articles on the new topic of economics and health.  It was also
carrying a growing number of articles on scientific research from
Latin American countries, as well as materials from the Bulletin
of the World Health Organization.  The dynamic events of the famous
meeting of Punta del Este in 1961, and PAHO's role in that
gathering, led to a new emphasis on health as a component of
development, an idea that gained momentum during the administration
of Dr. Héctor Acuña and continues to be an important focus under
the present Director, Dr. Carlyle Guerra de Macedo.
QUOTES 6 and 7
     By 1966 it had been recognized that there was a need to
publish a greater number of articles in English, and the Bulletin
of the Pan American Health Organization was created.  Up to 1970
it came out once a year and featured selections from the Boletín. 
Three issues were published in 1972, and in 1973 the current
quarterly publication schedule was adopted.  Today the Bulletin is
aimed mainly at English-speaking readers in the Caribbean countries
and the articles are selected with that criterion in mind,
independently of the articles published in the Boletín.
     In 1972 the Boletín celebrated it 50th anniversary, the
occasion being marked with the publication of an historical account
in the May issue.  With characteristic foresight, during the
previous year the Boletín had carried several articles on cholera
with a view to preparing the countries of Latin America for the
possibility of a seventh pandemic.  An article by Albert Sabin on
the elimination of poliomyelitis had also been published.  In 1973
the Boletín announced the most dramatic news in its history: 
smallpox had been completely eradicated from the Americas.  A few
years later, in 1978, it published the monumental Declaration of
Alma Ata.
     Under Dr. Acuña, responsibility for the production of several
publications, including the Boletín, was transferred to the PAHO
Representation in Mexico, although the journal's technical content
continued to be decided by the Office of Health and Biomedical
Publications at Headquarters.  In 1982, as the result of a cost-
benefit study ordered by the current Director, Dr. Guerra de
Macedo, the decision was made to return all publication services
to Headquarters.
     In recent decades, the Boletín's focus has shifted away from
general information toward more specific priority subjects.  A new
quarterly section called "Información farmacológica" was
inaugurated in July 1980 and today provides ongoing support to the
national agencies responsible for drug regulation.  With the
creation of new specialized journals such as the Boletín
Epidemiológico, Educación Médica y Salud, and the Boletín
Informativo PAI, as well as the publication of journals by the
various PAHO centers, the Boletín has gradually been relieved of
responsibility for disseminating the type of information carried
by those publications and has been able to turn its attention to
bridging information gaps in other areas. 
     While in earlier days articles were reviewed by the technical
programs of the Organization through an Advisory Committee, since
the 1980s this function has been carried out through a system of
peer review, in keeping with the practices of other international
biomedical journals.   As a result, the quality of the papers
selected for publication has steadily improved.  Since 1989, a
section entitled "Comunicación biomédica" has been offering
technical criteria for research and for the preparation of papers
while at the same time endeavoring to foster the capacity for
critical evaluation among its readers.  The section "Libros"
reviews more than 100 books a year and "Cartas de los lectores"
provides a forum for readers to share their observations.  The
Boletín has a pressrun of 16,500, is listed in various indexes and
electronic data bases, and receives between 350 and 500 articles
each year, 15% to 20% of which are eventually published.  Lengthy
special numbers of the Boletín have examined some of the major
concerns of our time, including mental health, economics and
health, AIDS, drugs, and bioethics.  The dynamic editorials of Dr.
Guerra de Macedo are paving new roads for the consolidation of
Regional solidarity and the search for health and equity as part
of development.
     Over the past seventy years, the Boletín has kept pace with
the unprecedented evolution of knowledge and applications in the
health sciences, from the development of new antibiotics and
vaccines to the spectacular advances in biotechnology.  As a
depository and an organ for the communication of knowledge, and
through its support for scientific research, the Boletín has made
an undeniable contribution to the development of public health in
the Western Hemisphere.  As the voice of the Organization, it has
also guided the Member Governments in the application of
collectively approved health policies and activities.  Above all,
the Boletín has helped to nuture Latin American thinking about
public health and cooperation among countries.  Its pages will
continue to reflect the forward-looking concerns of those who have
devoted their lives to the fight against poverty and disease, and
the Boletín will continue to chronicle both the milestones reached
and the failures and setbacks encountered in the ongoing effort to
achieve well-being for the peoples of the Americas.

In addition to the special articles about the cause, prevention,
and control of diseases, the Boletín Panamericano de Sanidad has
published monthly detailed data concerning the existence of
reportable diseases throughout the world but especially in Latin
America.  It has also published information on sanitation and the
maintenance of public health.  This Boletín is sent free of charge
to departments of health, practicing physicians, health officials,
and other concerned individuals in Latin America.  We have received
many commendations on the Boletín as well as numerous assurances
that it is indeed filling a gap.  -- Report of the Director, 1921-

Malaria has long been a dreaded enemy in tropical and subtropical
regions of the Americas.  Not only has it hindered material
progress in the countries of these regions but it has also given
them a reputation as unhealthful and dangerous places, which is the
worst damage it could have done.  Anyone who is concerned with
preventing this scourge should contact the International Sanitary
Bureau.  Notice that appeared regularly in the Boletín beginning
in December 1922

The authors of articles solicited by the Director of the Bureau
will receive 20 copies of the Boletín free of charge.  Authors who
submit papers that are accepted for publication will receive 10
copies of the Boletín free of charge.  Reprints may be obtained by
the author for a fee, which currently is US$0.50 per page for 100
copies, with a four-page minimum.  A surcharge will apply to
illustrations that require special paper.  Excerpt from the

The Boletín has now been engaged in carrying out its mission for
30 years.  Its format has evolved as progress has been made in
production techniques, although the emphasis has always been more
on substance than on form.  Conributions by physicians and health
specialists from all the countries have found their way onto the
pages of the Boletín.  This body of thought by the men of the
Americas who are concerned with public health is a valuable
historical legacy that will continue to shape the future. --

OBSERVATIONS ON THE DOCUMENT
      "THE MASTER PLAN FOR S. PNEUMONIAE PREVALENCE STUDY"


1.   The title of the document and the contents of the first
     paragraph are not consistent with the language used in the
     proposed protocol, which is aimed at determining the
     prevalence of the various serotypes of S. pneumoniae in cases
     of pneumonia in children under five years of age for the
     purpose of preparing a vaccine.

     A study of prevalence of S. pneumoniae, as the title and the
     first paragraph suggest, should include an overall sample of
     individuals among whom children--and children with pneumonia-
     -would constitute merely a subgroup to be considered.  

2.   Analysis of the remainder of the document will be made in
     consideration of the fact that the objective of the study is
     expressed in the proposal in the first paragraph of Point 1.

3.   A design plan for this objective might include:

     -    A definition of the target population of the study.
     -    An estimate of the size of the sample.
     -    A description of the techniques that will be used.
     -    The duration of the study.
     -    The procedures to be followed in analyzing the results
and drawing conclusions.


4.   The five points above are included in the document under
     study.  Some general considerations on each are presented
     below.

5.   Definition of the Target Population of the Study:

     -    Number of countries:  A hypothesis should be established
on the basis of which the number of countries in the
Region to be included in the study will be determined. 
Given that the vaccines in use in other countries
(Europe) cannot be used in Latin America, since they act
on different serotypes, the possible reasons for these
differences should be analyzed in order to determine how
many and which countries should be studied.  For example: 
Will it be possible to infer the situation in Nicaragua,
Ecuador, and Paraguay from the results obtained in
Brazil, Bolivia, and Mexico?

Epidemiological aspects may be considered in the
selection of the countries, but this does not provide an
answer to the above question.

     -    Age groups:  Although the population should be stratified
by age in order to consider possible variations in the
distribution of serotypes, certain special groups (two
or three-month old infants) in which pneumonia is
especially serious should be taken into account.

     -    Geographical distribution:  In order for the population
to be representative it should include different
geographical areas within the countries.  Consideration
should be given to whether the distribution of the
different serotypes of S. pneumoniae is the same in urban
and rural areas in order to include populations in both
areas.

Consideration of the rural area is important because the
rural population accounts for many of the deaths due to
pneumonia that take place each year because of lack of
access to the health services or because care is provided
too late. 

     -    Case definition:  In accordance with the target of the
study (first paragraph, Point 1 of these observations),
a clear definition of "case of pneumonia" will be
required, and it should be established whether the
definition adopted will be verified with a pattern in
order to confirm the diagnosis.

The criteria proposed by PAHO/WHO are adequate but have
been prepared with another objective (to identify the
greatest number of possible cases of pneumonia in order
to avoid death caused by not receiving adequate
treatment).  The objective of the study requires that the
greatest number of possible cases are really pneumonia,
and consequently these criteria should be supplemented
with other criteria to increase their specificity.

     -    Other factors:  Some of the considerations formulated in
the document under study are of great importance.

The population that is served by hospitals of high or
medium complexity does not appear to be appropriate for
obtaining results that lend themselves to extrapolation. 

Although there are studies that show that a high
proportion of the isolated nasopharyngeal serotypes from
carriers are the same as those that have been found to
produce pneumonia, the role played by carriers in
transmitting the disease is not clearly known.

The availability of adequate infrastructure in the
countries is a very important operational factor for the
success of the study.  However, if countries or areas
within the countries are not included because of these
limitations, decisions should be taken in consideration
of the observations formulated under "Number of
countries" and "Geographical distribution" on this same
point.

Are the serotypes that cause pneumonia in children the
same when they are associated with risk factors such as
malnutrition and environmental pollution exist?

6.   Estimate of the Sample Size:

     Estimate of the sample size should be associated with the
     conclusions that are expected to be drawn and the degree of
     generality to be given them.  To the extent that the groups
     to be studied are stratified, the size of the sample will
     increase.  On the other hand, failure to stratify the study
     may make it impossible to make adequate generalizations.

     Some additional limitations are determined by current lack of
     knowledge of the values of incidence of S. pneumoniae it is
     expected to find in each group and the different serotypes it
     might be possible to find in each.  More information should
     be compiled in this respect.






7.   Description of the Techniques To Be Employed:

     The considerations presented in the document under
     consideration include the principal concerns that can be
     expressed in this respect.

8.   Duration of the Study:

     There are no means available to prepare hypotheses on the
     variability over time of the causative serotypes of pneumonia
     in children.  Consequently, observations cannot be formulated
     for the period of 18 months proposed.

9.   Procedures for Analyzing the Results and Drawing Conclusions:

     The protocol should include details of these procedures.  The
     drawing of conclusions and their degree of generality should
     be closely associated with the decisions that are taken with
     regard to the points referred to above.

UNIVERSAL AVAILABILITY OF ESSENTIAL DRUGS:  
A HEALTH TARGET IN THE AMERICAS

     Of all the spectacular advances that have been made during the
twentieth century, few have benefited humankind as much as the
development of safe and effective drugs.  The continuous search for
new drugs has given rise to a huge transnational pharmaceutical
industry and to thousands of commercial products whose quality,
safety, registration, supply, advertising, and use require careful
regulation.  As a health agency, the Pan American Health
Organization (PAHO) has been a leader through the years, playing
a fundamental and decisive role in setting regulatory policies in
this area.
     Traditionally, technological dependency has made it necessary
for the health sectors in Latin America and the Caribbean to devote
a major portion of their budgets to the purchase of pharmaceutical
products.  At the same time, they have been unable to overcome some
of the difficulties characteristic of developing societies: 
unavailability of drugs to certain groups, lack of information and
false claims about drugs, discrepancies between demand and real
health needs, inappropriate use of products, and ineffective supply
systems.  PAHO, seeking to confront these problems and adapt its
policies to the priorities of the moment, has provided advisory
services to the countries of the Americas on an ongoing basis with
a view to placing safe, effective, good-quality pharmaceutical
products within the reach of all segments of the population.

Early Activities of the Pan American Sanitary Bureau (PASB)
     The United States Pharmacopeia, first published in 1820 and
since updated a number of times, was the officially recognized list
of drugs in the United States at the beginning of this century. 
In 1905, the II International Sanitary Conference proposed that it
be translated into Spanish in order to provide a basic reference
for physicians and pharmacists in the Americas.  The project was
slow to come to fruition, but the translation of the Eleventh
Revision of the Pharmacopeia and its First Supplement was finally
published in 1936.  It was followed three years later by the
translation of the Epitome of the Second Supplement.  This
impressive effort, carried out by the Bureau with the assistance
of auxiliary commissions from Cuba, Puerto Rico, and the
Philippines, is one of the earliest and most outstanding examples
of international scientific collaboration.
     In the early part of the present century all the countries had
independent pharmacopeias and there was a pressing need to
establish a common standard.  As early as 1923, the V International
Conference had recommended that the countries adopt uniform
regulations, and in 1924 the VII Pan American Sanitary Conference
laid the foundation for the corresponding legislation.  The
proposals of that Conference were subsequently adopted by the IX
Pan American Sanitary Conference in 1934, which also designated
PASB to act as liaison between the national commissions of the
American pharmacopeias.  In this connection, in 1938 the Bureau
published a series of 24 articles in the Boletín under the title
"La Farmacopea y el médico." 

Expansion of the Pharmaceutical Industry

     The Bureau's efforts in the area of drug regulation gained 
momentum with the rapid growth of the pharmaceutical industry
during World War II.  In 1947, the XII Pan American Sanitary
Conference recommended the creation of a committee on drugs and
foods to study problems arising from the exportation, importation,
manufacture, and supply of drugs, food, and cosmetics, coupled with
the establishment of standardization measures to facilitate
commercial exchange without sacrificing health objectives.  It also
recommended that the Bureau take steps to ensure the supply of
standards for determining drug potency to official laboratories. 
In response to the proposals of numerous previous Pan American
Sanitary Conferences, the XII Conference ratified the promulgation
of a Pan American Pharmacopeia--a project that never came to
fruition--and recommended that the countries endeavor to repress
the traffic of dangerous or fraudulent drugs, make a general
revision of pharmaceutical products and remove any that violated
the principles of modern therapeutics, and make the manufacturing
licenses renewable for periods not to exceed five years.
Quality Assurance Measures

     When the Bureau became the Regional Office of the World Health
Organization (WHO) in 1949, the World Health Assembly, under the
WHO Constitution, had already been given the authority to adopt
regulations concerning the quality, advertising, and labeling of
drugs moving in international commerce.  Over the next two decades
the Bureau concentrated on ensuring the safety, potency, and purity
of drugs and on setting guidelines for their evaluation.  With a
view to assuring quality from the preparation phase onward, it
approved a set of "good manufacturing practices," with which
manufacturers of pharmaceutical products were required to comply.
These standards have served as a basis for all quality control
activities since then.  To reinforce them, the Bureau has sponsored
numerous courses and workshops, many for its own staff members and
inspectors.
     During the following two decades WHO published the first
International Pharmacopeia, and the measures designed to ensure
legislative uniformity were strengthened.  With the assistance of
the Pan American Union, WHO, and the International Union for the
Protection of Industrial Property, in 1958 the Pan American
Sanitary Bureau [which was known as the Pan American Health
Organization (PAHO) beginning that year] established a food and
drug control program.  At the same time, the Executive Committee
suggested that laws be adopted in the countries giving the
Governments the authority to regulate research activities and all
aspects relating to the purchase, control, registration,
inscription, and distribution of drugs in their territories.  In
support of these measures, PAHO followed the recommendations of the
XV Pan American Sanitary Conference, held in 1958, and increased
distribution of the most recent publications on therapeutics and
pharmacology, organized meetings on the subject, and provided
resources for the training of specialists in control techniques. 
     The 1950s brought increased awareness of the damage that could
be done by irresponsible and false advertising of products.  A
number of strongly worded warnings were issued against "miracle
drugs," and in 1960 the Directing Council recommended the
prohibition of any false and misleading advertising that would
diminish the benefits of drug control laws.  Following a lengthy
study, PAHO determined to undertake a closer examination of certain
aspects of the problem, particularly the potential teratogenicity
of some drugs.  In 1962, the XVI Pan American Sanitary Conference
recommended that congenital defects be noted in certificates of
fetal death and live birth and that all pharmaceutical
preparations, both imported and of national manufacture, be subject
to a qualitative inspection.  Bearing in mind the latter
recommendation, in 1965 PAHO began working toward the establishment
of official international quality control laboratories, which would
later become important centers for research, reference, and
training.  It also began to sponsor annual meetings for the
officials responsible for food and drug control in Central America
and Panama.
     During the 1960s PAHO espoused policies aimed at extending the
drug supply services from the tertiary to the primary care level
while at the same time continuing its efforts to ensure the quality
of food and drugs and strengthening control activities in the
Region.  The first Seminar on Drug Control in the Americas, held
in 1970 and sponsored by PAHO and the Government of Venezuela,
emphasized the importance of adequate training for auxiliary
personnel and clinical pharmacologists and the need to standardize
existing policies.  Consumers were the focus of increasing
attention, as was brought to light in 1972 when the XV World Health
Assembly urged the Member Governments to provide their populations
with information about the use, hazards, and limitations of drugs. 
At the same time it requested them to study the shelf life of
pharmaceutical products and the maintenance of records and a system
of certification to guarantee good quality.

The Regional Program on Essential Drugs

     After the Declaration of Alma Ata (1976), PAHO turned its
attention to the cost and availability of drugs.  It was recognized
that if the target of "Health for All by the Year 2000" was to
become a reality, taking into account the rapid growth of the
population, a larger portion of the limited budget of the
Ministries of Health would have to be devoted to therapeutic agents
as key elements in the control of morbidity.  However, it was also
recognized that there were too many brand-name products in
circulation that did not correspond to the basic health needs and
economic capacity of the countries.  WHO responded to this
situation by preparing a list of essential drugs--using only
international nonproprietary names--based on criteria of cost,
effectiveness, and safety.  Inspired by this example, almost all
the countries in Latin America and the Caribbean succeeded in
preparing their own therapeutic formularies, or basic drug tables,
by the mid-1980s.  These have been reviewed periodically with a
view to adding or deleting products based on an assessment of their
relative benefits and risks.  Since 1978, decisions regarding the
safety and effectiveness of drugs have been published in a special
section of the Boletín entitled "Información farmacológica."
     Following the initiative of WHO, in 1983 PAHO launched the
Regional Program on Essential Drugs, which has two fundamental
objectives:  to support the development and application of basic
tables and to help the countries to create national drug programs
and policies based on their national health needs, their profile
of supply and demand, and the supply capacity of their industrial
sectors.  Between 1984 and 1989, PAHO published a sequence of
important works that included such titles as:  Elaboración y
utilización de formularios de medicamentos [Development and
Implementation of Drug Formularies], Políticas de producción y
comercialización de medicamentos esenciales [Policies for the
Production and Marketing of Essential Drugs], Clasificación
Internacional de Medicamentos [International Classification of
Drugs] (a document prepared in collaboration with WHO), Manual para
la administración de farmacias hospitalarias [Manual for the
Administration of Hospital Pharmacies], and Pautas para el
establecimiento de un programa nacional de control de medicamentos
[Guidelines for the Establishment of a National Drug Control
Program].  Despite the favorable impact of the foregoing measures,
the cost of drugs escalated and problems relating to the
administration of supply systems intensified during the economic
crisis of the 1980s.  In response to this situation, PAHO
concentrated its efforts on improving the efficiency of supply
systems and fostering self-sufficiency in the countries through
promotion of the manufacture of generic products at the national
level and the use of traditional drugs of proven safety and
efficacy.  It also began to provide support for financial and
administrative mechanisms designed to facilitate joint purchasing
of drugs by public sector entities.  Reiterating its traditional
support for regulatory agencies, in 1984 the Organization sponsored
the formation of the Latin American Network of Official Drug
Quality Control Laboratories.  The Network's sphere of action was
extended to encompass drug registration and regulation by the
Ibero-American Meeting on the Registration, Inspection, and Quality
Control of Drugs, held in Madrid in 1991.
     Policies on the production and marketing of essential drugs
were a central focus of the XXIX Meeting of the Directing Council
of PAHO in 1984, an important event at which considerable time was
devoted to discussion of the drug situation in specific countries
of the Region, as well as at the level of subregional markets. 
Today the multinational nature of many PAHO projects in the area
of drugs is an outgrowth of the need to bring regulatory and
normative criteria into line in order to respond to the processes
of economic and political integration that are taking place in the
Region.  Most projects are carried out in the context of the PAHO
subregional initiatives involving the Central American and Andean
countries (the Plan for Priority Health Needs in Central America
and Panama and the Andean Cooperation in Health), which assign
priority to essential drugs.

Rational Use of Drugs

     With the advent of the 1990s, the rational use of therapeutic
agents has begun to occupy a prominent place in the policies of the
Regional Program.  In this context, one of the biggest challenges
facing PAHO is to overcome the enormous resistance of professionals
and the public at large to the use of generic drugs for purposes
of prescription, dispensing, and consumption.  In order to ensure
the correct utilization of therapeutic agents, it will be
necessary, basically, to modify the way in which physicians and
pharmacists are trained and to awaken in the latter an awareness
of their vital role as true experts.  In 1990 the first Pan
American Conference on Pharmaceutical Education was held in Miami. 
The declaration of principles regarding the role of pharmacists
that emanated from that Conference has led pharmacy schools
throughout the Region to undertake an in-depth revision of their
curricula.  In order to enhance education in this area, PAHO has
created various centers in Central America and the Andean area to
disseminate up-to-date information.  The Organization itself is
continually disseminating information through a variety of
publications, many of them widely distributed reference materials. 
Notable among these are the Spanish-language version of the eighth
edition of USP Drug Information for the Health Professional, which
comprises two volumes and is published under an agreement signed
by PAHO, the Convention of the United States Pharmacopeia, and the
Ministry of Health and Consumer Affairs of Spain.  This work is a
prestigious international source of information on drugs for health
professionals.

Looking Toward the Future

     The Regional Program on Essential Drugs continues to grow
rapidly thanks to its capacity and willingness to respond to the
true needs of the peoples of the Americas.  While at the outset the
Program was concerned chiefly with regulation, today its scope has
expanded to include all drug-related matters, from the selection,
purchase, distribution, labeling, and quality control of drugs to
their prescription and use.  Increasing multidisciplinary
involvement in this area poses a challenge for the future,
particularly in view of the difficulty of coordinating the
interests of all the sectors concerned, but it is precisely this
characteristic that will ensure vitality and progress.  The Latin
American Conference on the Economic and Financial Aspects of Drugs,
held in Caracas, Venezuela, in March 1992, was one of the first
clear demonstrations of the way in which the pharmaceutical and
economic sectors today are inextricably linked.
     The Regional Program on Essential Drugs receives ongoing
support from the WHO Action Program on Essential Drugs, the United
States Food and Drug Administration, the Canadian Health Promotion
Branch, the Ministry of Health and Consumer Affairs of Spain, and
the American Association of Colleges of Pharmacy (AACP), as well
as a number of other public and private entities in the member
countries.  The Program is funded mainly through extrabudgetary
funds from WHO and projects with donor agencies.  The
pharmaceutical industry also provides support through its national
and international associations.  It is difficult to predict exactly
what direction the Program will take in the future but its course
will undoubtedly be determined by the technical innovations and
epidemiological, economic, political, and ideological trends that
develop along the way.  It will almost certainly have to grapple
with the challenges created by the biotechnological revolution, for
example, as well as the growing incidence of chronic and
environmentally related diseases in the developing countries.  The
PAHO Regional Program on Essential Drugs has heretofore been, is
now, and will continue to be a valuable instrument for the
Governments of the Americas in their effort to secure health and
well-being for their peoples.

     It is counterproductive to have drugs expire on the shelf
     as a result of administrative inefficiency.  PAHO is
     devoting a great deal of effort to modernizing the drug
     supply and distribution systems in its member countries.

     Essential drugs formularies are intended to help meet
     therapeutic needs in the health systems.  Consequently,
     they can be prepared for the entire health sector of a
     country, a specific health program, a rural dispensary,
     an urban clinic, a hospital, or any other health service
     unit.  Such formularies have been developed by the
     countries, with the collaboration of PAHO/WHO, in
     response to the need to control costs while at the same
     time assuring quality.

     Manufacture of pharmaceutical products at the national
     level and the use of generic drugs are two of the
     measures that PAHO is promoting in order to reduce costs
     and improve the availability of products.

1.   BACKGROUND

     In July 1972 the United Nations Conference on the
Environment, held at Stockholm, focused the world's attention on
environmental risks which threaten human health.

     Since then many countries and organizations have to a
greater or lesser degree made efforts to minimize such risks. 
Nevertheless, the impact on the environment caused by rapid
urbanization and population growth, together with industrial
development, has resulted in the magnitude of the environmental
problems which have adverse effects on human health increasing
instead of declining.

     In Latin America and the Caribbean, this situation has been
aggravated by the economic and social problems which many of the
countries are facing, negatively affecting their environmental
health policy, which in turn has produced an increase in the
number of health problems related to the environment.  The
epidemic of cholera which is affecting the Region dramatically
illustrates the severity of these problems.

     Although cholera had been identified as a problem of Asia
and later Africa, once the disease was introduced to Latin
America the existing deficient environmental situation provided
ideal conditions for its rapid dissemination.  Thus, the Region
began to pay a new debt, an Environmental Health debt which had
been accumulating during the past two decades through lack of
attention to environmental health problems.  If this situation
persists and increased attention is not paid to solving existing
deficiencies, we can only expect that public health problems
similar to those mentioned above will multiply.

     The European Charter on Environment and Health, signed at
Frankfurt in December 1989 by representatives of the countries of
that Region, points out "the vital importance of preventing risks
to health through the protection of the quality of the
environment."  It also recognizes the right of each individual to
live in an environment that permits him to achieve the highest
level of health and well-being.

     Throughout the developing world, however, the nature of the
problem is broad and complex, comprising multiple and
interconnected causes and many diseases.  For some countries the
greatest challenge in environmental health is lack of drinking
water; in others there are simultaneous and contrasting
situations such as those that occur under conditions of extreme
poverty and those due to intense economic development and
industrialization promoted by the urgent needs of a growing
population.

     Everyone's health is affected by the environment.  While new
concerns are arising in the urban environment, environmental
problems still persist in the rural environment.  Many
environmental pollution problems are not confined to the rural or
to the urban environment:  they know no geographical borders. 
Contamination of natural resourcesÐwater, air, and soilÐaffects
all.  Such problems also affect every social stratum:  rich and
poor eat contaminated food, drink unsafe water, and breathe
polluted air, but deterioration of the environment has a greater
impact on the poor, and women and children are exposed to greater
risk.

     Within this context, to speak of the framework for an
environmental health program is to speak of inter-professional
cooperation and community participation as pillars of activities
which will make it possible to improve public health.

     In view of the foregoing and especially the importance of
community participation for the success of activities which are
adopted to control the environmental risks at the local level,
the Pan American Health Organization has thought it desirable to
devote this Symposium to the subject of "Evaluation and
management at the local level of environmental risks to health."


2.   OBJECTIVES

To identify factors that help the community participate
in solving its environmental problems.

To generate guidelines which for the countries
facilitate the formulation of programs to control
environmental risks at the community level.


3.   PARTICIPANTS

Professionals from Ministries of Health, other sectors
of public and private entities, and ONGs which act to
protect and control the environment in the countries of
the Region of the Americas and the Caribbean.

Representatives from international cooperation agencies
which support the sector.

PAHO/WHO staff members.


4.   STRUCTURE OF THE SYMPOSIUM AND METHODOLOGY OF WORK

     There are three blocks of activities, with the objectives
and characteristics indicated below.

     FIRST BLOCK

     To present the principal environmental risks to human
health; recommend activities for their identification,
evaluation, and control at the local level, and mechanisms
applicable to the mobilization and social participation of
communities for environmental action.

     This block will be made up of conferences followed by a
discussion period.


     SECOND BLOCK

     To determine and analyze local experiences in management and
control of environmental risks, and to identify the factors
which, in such experiences, have contributed to community
participation in solving environmental problems.

     In this block the experiences of several countries and
institutions in developing integrated environmental health
programs at the local level will be presented through
conferences, highlighting community organization and forms of
action.

     In working groups, the participants will then analyze the
experiences presented and will attempt to identify factors
contributing to community participation.

     The final activity in this block will be a plenary session
in which the groups will present and discuss the factors they
identified.


     THIRD BLOCK

     Analysis and discussion in working groups of the items
presented in the two previous blocks.

     On that basis, and with their personal experiences, to
define the principal points which should be considered in
formulating and applying a plan to prevent and control
environmental risks at the local level, and identify recommended
strategies for its implementation, as well as the organizations
which should participate.

     Following the work of the groups, the results will be
presented and discussed at a plenary session and recommendations
will be formulated for intensifying the mobilization of the
community in solving its environmental health problems in the
Region.AGENDA OF THE REGIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON EVALUATION AND MANAGEMENT AT

INFORMATION ON LODGING


     In asking the PWR/Cuba and the Organizing Committee of the
XXIII AIDIS Congress to help reserve lodging for PAHO staff
members and participants in the Symposium which HPE will conduct
during the week before the Congress, we were informed that to
facilitate their transportation to the site at which the
Symposium will be held (the Palace of Conventions) it would be
necessary for all to be lodged in a single hotel.

     The options were analyzed and it was found that the most
desirable would be the Bio-Caribbean Hotel.  This hotel was
opened in 1991 and has very good facilities, and the meeting of
HPE/PAHO staff will be held in its conference room on 20 and 21
November.

     The Bio-Caribbean Hotel has set a special reduced rate for
the participants in the PAHO Symposium and has committed itself
to reserve the necessary number of rooms.  Since there will be
several international events with a high demand for lodging in
Havana in November, however, we were told that we should confirm
the total number of persons for whom rooms are to be reserved by
20 July.

     To be able to meet this requirement, it is necessary that
each PWR advise HPE by 15 July of the number of persons who will
travel to Cuba for the PAHO Symposium.  If PAHO staff members
travel with family members, they should indicate their number and
how many rooms they wish reserved for them.

     To facilitate Symposium participants remaining in Cuba for
the AIDIS Congress, an effort was made to diminish costs for
lodging, transportation, and feeding.  For this purpose, the
Organizing Committee of the Congress was asked to prepare a
"tourist package" including those items similar to the one it
prepared for persons who will attend only the Congress.

     The following pages include an informative pamphlet from the
Bio-Caribbean Hotel and the cost of the tourist package
coordinated by the Organizing Committee of the AIDIS Congress.

     Two options appear in the costs shown, the first for persons
who will attend only the PAHO Symposium, and the second for
persons who will remain in Cuba to the end of the Congress.  In
both cases, the cost of the tourist package has been calculated
taking into account the special rates of the Bio-Caribbean Hotel
for lodging and food, and transportation includes that from the
Hotel Bio-Caribbean to the Palace of Conventions and vice versa. 
The term "meals" in the enclosed information refers to suppers
since at noon the participants will be at the Palace of
Conventions and the cost of meals there will be paid at the time
by each person.  Depending on consumption, that cost may vary
from U$9 to U$20 each time.

     To facilitate coordination of transportation from the
airport to the hotel, the airline and day and hour of arrival of
each participant will have to be reported to the PWR-Cuba a week
before the planned date of arrival in Cuba.
ENCLOSURE III

ASPECTS TO CONSIDER IN OBTAINING VISAS
TO TRAVEL TO CUBA


1.   The PWR Cuba has offered to collaborate in obtaining visas
for all the participants in the PAHO Symposium.  To be able to do
this, it is necessary that each PWR send the PWR Cuba the
following data about each person at least 45 days before the
planned date of the trip:


Name and two surnames
Date of birth
Country of birth
Current nationality
Passport number
Place and date of issuance of the passport
Date of expiration of the passport.


2.   The place and/or way in which visas will be delivered to
participants in each country will vary according to whether a
Cuban Embassy or Interests Office exists in the country.  In
countries without such offices, the PWR in the country should
indicate for each person where the visa is to b
