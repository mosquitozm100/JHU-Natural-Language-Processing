esentations, working with and through the Ministry of Health. 

   Dr. Knouss, Deputy Director, pointed out that the initiative is not a panacea that
is intended to solve all the problems of financing in the health sector but rather an
attempt to identify possible sources of funds, which might be lost to other sectors
unless the health sector takes advantage of them.  Several countries had already
indicated their interest in this source of financing, and the Organization would be
doing them a disservice if it were not prepared to help them in this regard. 
Moreover, several of the donor agencies that hold large debt amounts have
indicated that they would welcome the Organization's efforts to promote this
concept in the health sector, because otherwise these sums will be channeled
toward other sectors.

   At no time has an attempt been made to impose this activity as one of the
Organization's functions; however, it is extremely important that it be able to
respond positively both to the Governments and to the donors.

Item 6:                                                                                                     Evaluation in the Pan American
Health Organization

   In presenting this item, Mr. Dixon, PASB, pointed out that evaluation is one of
the essential components of the PAHO Managerial Strategy.  It is the process by
which an organization:  (1) seeks to determine the extent to which completed work
has achieved the original objectives, and (2) establishes a basis for corrective
action.  Evaluation is a complex task in any field, but it is especially problematic
in social areas such as health because causality is difficult to establish.  The need
for public organizations to be sensitive to public priorities, and the fact that limited
resources need to be administered prudently, are reasons for the establishment of
evaluation procedures.

   Within PAHO, evaluation of the Organization's technical cooperation program
is accomplished through:  (1) the annual internal evaluations of the Regional and
country programs, and (2) the biennial evaluations that are carried out jointly with
national officials at the country level.  Significant advances have been made in the
establishment of evaluation procedures within PAHO, but further efforts are
needed.  In particular, the evaluation process would benefit from a clearer
definition of its purpose and of the results that are sought and the activities that are
to be carried out at the project level, as well as a precise definition of indicators to
facilitate measurement activities.

   Discussion

   All the members agreed that the document was outstanding, both in terms of its
content and the frankness with which the pros and cons of the various issues were
presented.  It was considered that such frankness should always guide the contacts
between the Bureau and the Governments.

   They also concurred with the Bureau's judgment that, given the scarcity of
resources, organizations supported by public funds must show themselves to be
ever more fiscally and programmatically responsible. 

   It was pointed out that the evaluation process, notwithstanding the many
components that comprise it, is rather weak with regard to its capacity to measure
results or impact on health.  In this respect, it was suggested that the secretariat
continue to seek ways of evaluating impact on health since otherwise it would
appear that evaluation is only programmatic.  The possibility was mentioned that
PAHO might directly support the countries in expanding their own capacities for
evaluation.

   It was also mentioned that perhaps too many evaluative mechanisms are being
utilized and it might be desirable to consolidate them, with a view to reducing the
amount of resources that are being invested in this activity.  In this connection, a
question was raised as to whether or not the secretariat had considered the
advisability of creating an evaluation unit within the Bureau in order to partially
centralize the functions that are now being carried out by different units at
Headquarters and in the countries in the evaluation of their own activities.

   It was pointed out that it would be desirable to implement a system to monitor the
results and agreements that come out of the joint evaluations carried out at the
country level, since at present there does not appear to be sufficient follow-
up on the conclusions of these evaluations.

   Dr. Alleyne, Assistant Director, reported that a meeting would soon be held with
officials from the Ministries of three Caribbean countries with a view to
introducing the approach of more specific and precise programming, since this is
considered a sine qua non for good evaluation.  He also pointed out that any
modification in the allocation of resources is always preceded by an evaluation of
the programs in question, which involves confirming whether or not these
programs correspond to mandates from the Governing Bodies.

   The Director mentioned one type of evaluation that had recently been carried out
at the project level with the donors of extrabudgetary resources.  Joint evaluation
and coordination meetings are held with these donors, in which, in addition to
evaluating the projects carried out jointly with a view to achieving more concerted
action, an effort is made to improve the coordination of other cooperation activities
being carried out by the countries on a bilateral basis with these donor entities.  In
so far as the secretariat is concerned, the Director indicated that it is subject to a
number of external evaluations, such as external audits, as well as those conducted
by the Governing Bodies of the Organization.  With regard to the frankness that it
had been mentioned should characterize relations between the Organization, the
Bureau, and the Governments, he pointed out that it must always be borne in mind
that certain information is the exclusive province of the Governments and only
they could decide whether or not it should be made public. 

   With regard to the creation of an evaluation unit it was reported that the Bureau
had concluded, on the basis of several studies, that a central evaluation unit would
tend to grow excessively and would ultimately become an impediment.

Item 7:                                                                                                     Regional Plan for Investment in the
Environment and Health

   The Director presented the document, recalling that the idea of proposing an
ambitious plan for investment in health and the environment came about as a result
of the resurgence of cholera in the Region.  The epidemic had made apparent
something which everyone was aware of but which had been obscured because of
sociopolitical considerations:  the profound deficiencies and inadequacies in living
conditions in the Region, particularly with regard to health and environmental
infrastructure. 

   At the Ibero-American Summit of Heads of State held in Guadalajara, Mexico,
in July 1991, the Bureau proposed the development of a plan for investment in
health and the environment.  The idea was accepted and incorporated into the
declaration of that Summit.  Subsequently, the XXXV Meeting of the Directing
Council adopted Resolution XVII, in which it requests the Director to prepare, in
close collaboration with the Member Countries and other cooperation agencies, a
long-term plan of investment in health and the environment for meeting
infrastructural needs in those areas.

   In fulfillment of that mandate, a working group was created within the Bureau to
prepare an initial proposal document.  This is to be submitted to the Second Ibero-
American Summit of Heads of State, which will be held in Madrid in July 1992. 
If the Summit affirms the idea and approves the plan, this document will be utilized
as a basis for collaboration and coordination with other cooperation organizations,
in particular the multilateral banks, especially for work at the national level.

   In addition to this plan for investment, a proposal will be presented to the heads
of state at the Madrid Summit for the creation of a special pre-investment fund to
support country activities aimed at preparing projects that would put into effect the
provisions of the plan that is being proposed.

   The decision as to whether or not this point will be included on the agenda of the
Madrid meeting will be made at the preparatory meeting to be held in that city on
18 and 19 May 1992.  Based on the indications received from several Ministries
of Foreign Affairs, it seems likely that this matter will become one of the four
items, and probably the central item, on the agenda of the Summit.  The
preliminary version of the document is to be distributed among the various
ministries, and it will be discussed with the Ministers of Health from the Region
at the World Health Assembly in Geneva before it is submitted to the
aforementioned preparatory meeting.

   In the initial proposal it was estimated that the cost of the plan would be $US 200
billion for a period of 12 years.  Now, after more detailed analysis, it is anticipated
that the plan can very well be carried out with a large input of internal resources,
on the order of 70%, together with financing from other external sources, on the
order of 30%.

   All this appears to indicate that the proposal, although it may not be feasible at
this moment, is at least viable, and its feasibility can be ensured if there is
sufficient political will.  The Bureau is committed to making this happen.

   Discussion

   The members of the Subcommittee expressed their unanimous support for the
initiative, which they believe to be essential.  Although they recognized that the
outbreak of cholera had led to the implementation of a number of emergency
measures, these did not resolve the underlying problems, which include lack of
reliable water supply and excreta disposal systems and contamination of water
sources.

   Both the working document and the presentation made by the secretariat were
considered very complete.  The members of the Subcommittee underscored the
necessity of generating sufficient political will and indicated that perhaps the time
is ripe for achieving this commitment.  It was also suggested that those countries
in the Region which would not be participating in the Madrid Summit should be
informed of the outcome of that meeting as well as any other subregional meeting
or forum.
   
   It was noted that the document discusses what needs to be done, as well as what
exists already and what can be recovered or repaired.

   There was discussion of the need to endeavor to influence the officials of the
multilateral banks that may participate in this initiative with a view to ensuring that
investments in activities relating to health and the environment are not be
considered strictly in terms of short-term economic benefit.  The degree to which
health and the environment can be improved will determine to a large extent the
type of society in which future generations will live in the twenty-first century. 

   In response to a concern expressed by one of the members regarding the
competition that might be created with other sectors in terms of demand for both
national and external financing, the secretariat indicated that, in its calculations, it
had taken into account the trends in the countries over the past two decades with
regard to investment financing in these two areas, as well as the decisions by the
World Bank to allocate at least 25% of its resources to social projects.  These were
factors that had been taken into account in order to arrive at the investment
estimates and percentages.

   It was pointed out that the plan is a frame of reference.  It is the first step in a
process that the countries will be responsible for developing.  The plan will not
incorporate projects but rather will indicate areas, approaches, and total financing. 
The plan will be developed using as a frame of reference the national plans for
investment in a set of projects.

   The secretariat, in the conceptualization of its reference model, has attached
particular importance to the matter of cost recovery, the problem of maintenance,
and the burden that is placed on the countries by recurring costs in connection,
inter alia, with the maintenance mentioned.

   The Director pointed out that the plan is, in essence, a strategy for dealing with
the basic problems of infrastructure in the area of health and the environment,
which are directly related to the living conditions of the populations of Latin
America and the Caribbean.  It calls for a different vision of the development
process in Latin America, both in regard to its nature and the specific policies by
which it is implemented.  Development cannot simply be a repetition of past
experiences, which are basically identified with economic growth; rather, an
attempt must be made to utilize economic growth to improve the well-being of the
population through greater equity in the distribution of the benefits generated by
that growth.

   The plan expresses, and at the same time implies, a profound change and a
thorough reorientation of the systems and services that provide individual health
care as well as environmental services.  In addition, the Director indicated that if
the proposal can be made viable and feasible from a political, technical,
operational, and economic standpoint, it will establish a guide for the work of the
Organization in the coming years, consistent with the strategic orientations
approved by the Pan American Sanitary Conference.  Finally, coinciding with the
view expressed by one of the members, he underscored the importance of the work
of political promotion and the contribution that the Governments can make in this
sense.

   The Subcommittee concluded its discussion on the item by recommending to the
Governments of the Region that they promote the inclusion of this item on the
agenda of the Ibero-American Summit of Heads of State to be held in Madrid in
July 1992.

Item 8:                                                                                                     Health of Indigenous Peoples

   Dr. José María Paganini, PASB, in presenting this item, pointed out that the
proposal on the health of indigenous peoples is framed within the strategic
orientations and program priorities for the quadrennium.  He emphasized that
health in development, community participation, health promotion,
decentralization, and the solution to priority problems are all concepts and lines of
action that are applicable to the indigenous peoples of the Americas.

   He reviewed the historical, political, and socioeconomic context of the indigenous
peoples, noting that they occupy the lowest rungs of the socioeconomic ladder in
the Region.  It is estimated that the indigenous population in the Americas totals
42 million.

   Very little is known about the specific health situation of indigenous
communities, and for this reason it is proposed that a Regionwide effort be
mounted to compile and analyze information on this situation as well as on the
health services available to the indigenous population.  It is considered that the
strategies of decentralization and local health system development can support
local efforts to promote participation and organization, taking into account the
special needs of this population.

   He reported that there is a proposal to hold a hemispheric workshop in Canada in
1993, with full participation by indigenous peoples.  The purpose of the workshop
will be to analyze the situation and propose joint lines of action.

   Discussion

   The members of the Subcommittee were unanimous in underscoring the
importance of this issue, and they commended Canada for having raised it at a
previous meeting of the Subcommittee.  The importance that the Organization
attaches to this matter is evidenced by the funds that the Director has allocated for
the workshop to be held.

   It was pointed out that the question of the health of indigenous peoples will be
treated as an initiative rather than as a program or project, since it is seen as a
process that might culminate in a plan of action for a decade that will support
present and future action aimed at improving the health and well-being of the
indigenous peoples of the Americas.

   It was emphasized that this initiative should include the active participation,
guidance, and leadership of the indigenous people themselves.  It was also stressed
that it is essential to obtain as much information as possible on the various
indigenous groups, as well as to listen carefully to what these groups can tell us
about themselves.  It is important to seek out information about how indigenous
communities are caring for their own health, since much remains to be learned in
this respect.

   It was pointed out that it would be wise to proceed slowly at first in order to
ensure full participation by concerned groups in the countries, together with the
Ministries and the PAHO Representatives.

   The meeting to be held in 1993 has been designated a "workshop" expressly to
emphasize the importance of discussion, dialogue, and working as a group to
formulate policy recommendations and strategies aimed at meeting the needs of
indigenous peoples.  It was pointed out that this workshop will provide an
opportunity to discuss the health practices of indigenous groups with the
organizations that deal specifically with health-related matters as well as with other
organizations that have an interest in this issue.

   It was indicated that there is a need to review and expand the concept of the
Caribbean, because the list of countries that plan to participate in the workshop did
not include Guyana and Suriname.  They, like the island nations of the Caribbean,
desire to participate actively in this initiative.

   It was noted that the document presented could benefit from the inclusion of more
data, as well as some examples.  It was pointed out that the problem of statistics
is complicated by problems associated with the self-identification of individuals
with one ethnic group or another. 

   It was also recognized that indigenous groups are living in a precarious social
situation, which makes them extremely vulnerable.  The Organization and the
member countries must address this problem with a view to generating the political
will required to implement concrete solutions so that indigenous peoples can cease
to be the most unprotected and vulnerable groups and become recognized and
respected groups who enjoy the necessary minimum health conditions to enable
them to lead fulfilling lives within the framework of their cultures.

   Mexico was cited as an example of a country that has a national institute devoted
specifically to the study of indigenous issues through an approach that is
comprehensive and multisectoral and takes into consideration all the cultural,
ethnic, and other facets of these issues.

   It was suggested that this matter should not be considered strictly from the
standpoint of health, but rather other factors should be examined, including
education, economics, etc. in the context of development.  In addition, it is
necessary to define the population that is to be targeted by this initiative, i.e.,
whether it is to include those who lack access to health services in general or only
those who lack access for cultural or ethnic reasons.

   The Subcommittee recommended that a report on the outcome of the workshop
to be held in Canada in 1993 should be presented to the Governing Bodies of the
Organization.

Item 9:                    Democracy and Health

In presenting the revised and updated version of the document that was
submitted to the Seventeenth Meeting of the Subcommittee in December 1991, Dr.
Vieira, PASB summarized the factors that had led PAHO to develop this project,
as well as the objectives and conclusions of the four subregional meetings of
lawmakers promoted in cooperation with the Organization of American States,
with which the implementation of this initiative began in 1990.  He reviewed the
evolution of cooperation with the legislatures since then, outlining the activities
that have been carried out at the national, subregional, and Regional levels.

He mentioned several of the positive results of the initiative as elements for
a preliminary evaluation, and he discussed futures prospects in this area.

Discussion

One of the members said that he did not find much difference in terms of
content between the revised document and the one that had been submitted to the
Subcommittee in December 1991.  He asked for clarification regarding the
channels of communication that would be used in contacts with the legislatures, the
priorities, the cost of the program, the allotment of funds for implementing it, and
the development of a methodology for evaluating the program.

Another member voiced the opinion that, although the document was perhaps
not terribly explicit, it did indeed respond to some of the concerns expressed by the
previous speaker.  He considered the initiative extremely important because its
objective was to make legislators aware that health is an area that must be given
the priority that it deserves.  Health is not just one of the basic elements required
for development but one of its objectives.  Advantage should be taken of the
opportunity offered by meetings of different groups of lawmakers in order to raise
their level of awareness about this issue.

The same member commended the Bureau for this initiative and informed the
Subcommittee that a meeting had been held of the Commission on Health, Labor,
and Social Security of the Latin American Parliament, with the participation of 75
lawmakers from 17 countries of the Region.  A wide range of health-related issues
had been discussed, which testified to the interest of legislators in this matter and
to the validity of the initiative.  The Commission appreciated the Organization's
efforts to ensure that the legislative branch, in coordination with the executive
branch, would have a role in the formulation of health policy in the Region.

One of the members, indicating that he supported the initiative, pointed out
that a future edition of the working document on this matter should clarify the
distinction between the parliamentary systems in the English-speaking Caribbean
and the systems in other countries of the Region, since some of the difficulties
indicated might derive from confusion over the functioning of these two types of
legislative systems. 

The secretariat responded to the aforementioned comments, indicating that
the report presented was largely an overview of what had occurred in the past
rather than a plan for future action.  With regard to the question concerning
evaluation, it was indicated that this was to be accomplished through the same
methodology and mechanisms that are applied in other programs of the
Organization, although perhaps in this particular case a more specific mechanism
should be developed.  It was also mentioned that thus far the Ministries of Health
have indicated that they are quite satisfied, and they have even participated in the
activity.  He reiterated that the funds allocated for the promotion of this initiative
are Regional funds and are not taken from funds allocated to the Ministries of
Health.

The Director indicated that pursuant to the Subcommittee's consensus that
this matter should be submitted to the Governing Bodies of the Organization for
formal approval, the secretariat would add to the report under discussion a proposal
of activities, which will specify the objectives and expected outcomes, together
with the mechanisms for action, detailing very clearly the role of the executive
branch, in particular the Ministries of Health.  In addition, a process of monitoring
and evaluation will be established for application in the future.

The Director emphasized that the Bureau considers this activity to be of
extraordinary value both from a political and operational standpoint and even from
a practical standpoint in terms of internal discussions regarding budgeting and the
allocation of resources to the health sector.

The Subcommittee agreed that a revised edition of the report, together with
a proposal of activities, should be presented to the Executive Committee and to the
Directing Council for their approval.

Item 10:  Other Matters

It was decided that the Chairman should present the report on the
Subcommittee's activities to the Executive Committee to be held in June 1992. 
The Vice Chairman or the Rapporteur will submit the report if the Chairman is
unable to do so.

The following two items were suggested for inclusion on the agenda of the
next meeting of the Subcommittee: 

-       Results of the evaluation of PAHO/WHO technical cooperation in Cuba.

-       Evaluation of a Regional program.

With regard to the date for the 19th Meeting of the Subcommittee, it was
suggested that it be held either in late November or early December 1992.





Message from the Director

Latin America and the Caribbean have lived through many years of a severe economic
crisis marked by fiscal austerity, lowered incomes, rising unemployment, and exacerbated
poverty and inequality.  In 1991 the per capita gross national product scarcely reached the
level it had attained in 1977, fourteen years earlier.  This situation has had far-reaching
implications for the health sector.

The Pan American Health Organization/World Health Organization (PAHO/WHO) has
been and will continue to be involved in working with the countries of the Region in the
search for innovative alternatives to improve the health and well-being of their peoples.

The Organization's Managerial Strategy underscores the importance of its role as a
catalyst in the process of resource mobilization and emphasizes the need to ensure more
active coordination with other multilateral and bilateral cooperation organizations in the
area of health.  The Organization must be prepared to assume leadership in the area of
international cooperation in health, helping the countries to identify external sources of
technical and economic cooperation for the health sector.  The Managerial Strategy also
indicates that the Organization should assist the countries in taking the steps required in
order to achieve closer cooperation that is consistent with national needs and priorities,
as well as with Regional objectives.  The importance of resource mobilization is also
stressed in the Strategic Orientations and Program Priorities (SOPPs) for the Pan
American Health Organization during the Quadrennium 1991-1994, approved by the Pan
American Sanitary Conference in September 1990.  The SOPPs urge the countries to
utilize the flow of external financial resources to induce or consolidate the necessary
transformations of their national health systems. 

The Organization must therefore assign top priority to its collaboration with the countries
in the search for additional financial resources for health, both from bilateral sources and
from multilateral agencies.  To this end, it will continue to support the countries in
identifying possible cooperation agencies and in preparing proposals for their
consideration.

This manual, prepared by the PAHO External Relations Coordination Unit, is intended
to strengthen the countries' capacity to mobilize resources for the priority activities of the
health sector.  It includes a description and analysis of the role and characteristics of
international cooperation in the area of health, as well as detailed, up-to-date information
on the cooperation agencies that support activities aimed at improving health in the
Americas.

Part II of the manual will be updated on an ongoing basis, and new profiles of agencies
will be added as the circumstances warrant.

It is my hope that the document will serve as a source of information and an instrument
to aid health sector personnel in their search for additional resources so that "Health for
All" may become a reality.

Introduction


The Global Program on AIDS (GPA) of the World Health
Organization (WHO) regards research as a fundamental element in
the prevention, control, and treatment of this disease.  To the
extent that the GPA is capable of documenting and utilizing
advances in research, it will be better able to develop
effective strategies for intervention and ensure timely
application of new technologies at the national, regional, and
world level.

The difficult conditions under which research is being carried
out in our countries make it essential to ensure that resources
are used rationally and initiatives are taken to prevent
duplication of efforts and unnecessary expenditure of resources. 
Thus it is essential to develop mechanisms that will facilitate
coordination between various research groups and strengthen
their work, enrich the results of their projects, and encourage
access to the benefits of research as they become available.

In order to respond to these needs on a timely basis, the Pan
American Health Organization (PAHO), with the support and
collaboration of WHO and the National AIDS Campaigns, has
conducted an Inventory of Research Resources on AIDS with a view
to learning more about the kind of research being carried out
in the countries of Latin America and the Caribbean.  This
Inventory constitutes a basic instrument for facilitating
knowledge about where and how scientific projects on AIDS and
human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection are being carreid
out in the different countries of Latin America and the
Caribbean, with a view to identifying gaps and promoting
projects that will support programs for the prevention, control,
and treatment of AIDS.

The Inventory has yielded information, in the form of the
present catalog, which we hope will be used by investigators,
academic institutions, agencies that coordinate and promote
research policies, national health programs, and persons
concerned with the prevention of AIDS in the Americas.

We also hope that this catalog will help to strengthen ties
between investigators and facilitate contacts and coordination
between them.

Sincerely,



Fernando Zacarías
Principal Regional Advisor on AIDS/STD


Methods


The Inventory focuses on the research project as its primary
subject of concern.  Activities under way or to be carried out
have been identified from the perspective of generation of
scientific knowledge.  The activities should be systematized in
the form of a research protocol or proposal that sets forth the
hypotheses, objectives, methodology, schedule of work, and
budget.  The Inventory includes research projects on AIDS that
have been recognized and approved by the institution and are
either under way or already completed.

The information was collected using a standardized questionnaire
that was adapted by the GPA from a survey conducted in other
regions of the world.  For each research project, information
was gathered on its objective, methodology, results, and
publications.  In addition, the Inventory compiled information
on the investigators, institutions, and project financing. 
Information was also obtained on the characteristics and
resources of the laboratories providing assistance to the
various projects.

The questionnaire was used in all the institutions that are
carrying out research in AIDS, including biomedical,
epidemiological, social, behavioral, and operations research. 
For purposes of the Inventory, epidemiological research is
considered to include studies on distribution of the population,
the risk of transmission and/or natural history of HIV
infection, and the determining factors thereof.  Social and
behavioral research is considered to be concerned with behaviors
that pose risks for HIV, such as sexual behavior or patterns
associated with drug addiction (including preventive behavior
such as the use of contraceptive methods), as well as cultural,
social, and psychological determinants or knowledge.  The area
of operations research is considered to cover the efficiency,
effectiveness, and effectiveness of the interventions, programs,
and services aimed at preventing or controlling HIV infection,
including the economic impact of this disease.  Finally, the
biomedical area is that which is concerned with biological
aspects and the pathogenicity of HIV, as well as aspects related
to diagnosis, therapy, and clinical manifestations of HIV
infection in any of its phases, including AIDS.

In order to obtain information on all the research projects
underway, it was necessary first to identify them.  Accordingly,
a wide net was cast to locate all the institutions and
investigators in all the countries that had presented results
on HIV-related research in scientific journals or meetings.  On
the basis of this information, a preliminary list of projects
and investigators was prepared which served as a basis for the
first step in collecting the information.  In those countries
where a large number of projects were identified, the assistance
of local national personnel was enlisted.  The job of these
collaborators was to ensure that the list of projects was
complete, to contact the investigators working on the projects
and explain to them the purpose and usefulness of the Inventory,
to provide them with the questionnaires and ask them to fill
them out, and to review the questionnaires once they were
completed.  In the countries that had fewer projects, these
functions were performed by consultants who were sent there
specifically for this purpose.

In the field, the investigators who were contacted often were
able to indicate other projects that had not been identified
before.  The collection of data for the Inventory began in March
1991 and ended in September of that year.

A total of 651 research projects were identified, of which 561
met the specified criteria for inclusion in the Inventory. 
Sixty-eight questionnaires were excluded because it was deemed
that the information referred more to programs of activities
that to research as such.  Another 23 projects were considered
to come under other projects already identified and the
corresponding information was merged.

The information contained in this catalog is precisely what was
obtained from the investigators, without any intentional
modification on our part.  In order to avoid any problem of
misinterpretation of the texts, they have been left in their
original form without any editorial intervention.

informative summary of contributions received from the PAHO
Country Representations and the Regional technical programs on
implementation of the health promotion strategy.

     These contributions were requested from the Country
Representations in December 1991 with a view to preparing a
working document for implementation of the health promotion
strategy within PAHO, as requested by the Director.

     Cooperation was also sought from the Regional technical
programs.  For this purpose, members of the HPA staff contacted
appropriate personnel in each of the programs.

     The report includes all contributions received as of 31
March 1992.  These contributions cover both conceptual and
operational aspects; in some cases, documents are attached
dealing with local programming or procedural aspects.

document "Implementing the Health Promotion Strategy in the Pan
American Health Organization")


Argentina

     The report received outlines the Ministry of Health policies
on health promotion and protection to be undertaken at the
national level.

     The activities fall into three main categories:

     - ) Control of risk factors and prevention of disease
     - ) Health education of the general population
     - ) Improvement of the quality and safety of food products

     The document cites the need to incorporate intersectoral and
transectoral approaches, as well as community participation, into
the programs and to design "major programs for major problems"
rather than isolated interventions.

     This report has been included as an illustrative example in
the document in question.


Bahamas

     The program for 1992 includes a workshop aimed at defining
strategies and a plan of action in the area of health promotion,
as well as plans for a visit by the Coordinator of HPA to provide
advisory services on the subject.

Costa Rica

     A multidisciplinary working group (Ministry of Health, Costa
Rican Social Security Fund, and PAHO/WHO) has been formed and is
in the process of formulating a National Plan for Comprehensive
Care of Adults" to be submitted to the national authorities.

     The objectives of the plan are to promote healthy lifestyles
and to decrease the prevalence of risk factors associated with
chronic non communicable diseases (CND).

     The plan provides for community participation as a
fundamental element in the planning and execution of activities.

Cuba

     The contribution received includes conceptual and
operational definitions.

     It emphasizes the consensus already reached regarding the
importance of health promotion and the need to find working
elements and solutions that will offer alternatives for advancing
health promotion in the countries.

     The document highlights health promotion as a broad concept
that goes beyond health education, and it underscores the need to
ensure that projects and actions are intersectoral in nature, all
of which is achieved more easily when priority is given to work
carried out at the local level in the context of local health
systems.

     It suggests, moreover, that cooperation projects should be
developed on an interprogram basis from the moment that they are
generated in PAHO.

     Finally, it cites the importance of using epidemiology and
of constructing positive indicators as measurements to facilitate
the diagnosis, design, and evaluation of actions.

     Among the activities currently under way are comprehensive
health intervention projects in the Las Tunas and Cienfuegos
Provinces.


Dominican Republic

     The PWR has provided a brief description of a number of
general topics.

     Efforts in this country have focused on using the promotion
strategy as an approach to dealing with priority local problems,
which are defined jointly with the community.  The community also
participates in identifying and implementing solutions.

     The document emphasizes the preparation and dissemination of
educational messages on health at the local level, utilization of
the mass media at the national level, and the promotion of
research on the perceptions of the population with regard to
health.


Ecuador

     This country's contribution is in the form of a document by
the Ministry of Health on standards for the care of families,
groups, and individuals at the basic and complementary level,
which is part of a project for the strengthening and expansion of
basic health services in Ecuador.

     The document is concerned mainly with medical care services
and includes an initial effort to incorporate aspects of health
promotion and community participation.


Suriname

     The PWR has provided a discussion of concepts and, on this
basis, a list of suggested actions.

     The document underscores the need for more training in the
concept of promotion and the associated technologies, such as
health education, use of the mass media, public speaking
techniques, etc.  This training should begin with staff in the
organization itself and personnel in the national health systems.

     It points out the need to have educational units at the
local level that are well established and have their own
resources, and to undertake actions through the mass media that
will counteract the powerful negative messages that people
receive.


Venezuela

     The PWR notes that work is proceeding on a program for
implementation of the health promotion strategy which involves
the use of social communication with the support of experts in
that area.

     The program seeks to give the population information and
knowledge that will promote awareness about needs and a search
for alternative approaches to the attainment of well-being.

     Work is currently under way in such areas as AIDS, cancer,
alcohol, drugs, accidents, and tobacco.  Also ongoing are
activities aimed at providing social communicators with
motivation and training in the area of health.

     The report is accompanied by a document that outlines the
plan and the actions being carried out.

REGIONAL TECHNICAL PROGRAMS

    (Summary of the reports received as contributions to the
preparation of the document on implementation of the health
promotion strategy in PAHO)


     Regional Program on Women, Health, and Development--PWD

     The Program has provided the rapporteur's final report from
the Latin American Working Group on Women, Health, and Self-Care
(Colombia 1991) and a document on health and self-care, with
focus on women making decisions about their own lives, which
served as a basis for discussion and motivation of the
participants.

     The Working Group discussed the concept of self-care in
light of the theories of development, social participation,
social medicine, and gender.

     It emphasized the broad scope of self-care, which includes,
in addition to physical care, individual and social aspects as
well.

     It was concluded that self-care should permit and foster
self-determination, self-esteem, and autonomy, and that it should
go beyond the realm of the individual and become a social
necessity.

     Given the implications and the progress achieved in this
area, the definitions and suggestions that emanated from this
exercise relate more to the concept of health promotion than to
the traditional meaning of self-care.

     The resulting suggestions focus on:  the need to define the
priorities and content of self-care through a horizontal and
participatory process; the need to disseminate the concept and
practice of self-care via different media; and the need to
delineate the role of state agencies and NGOs in this area.


Environmental Health--HPE

     The unit has provided a document that presents a framework
for care of the environment for use by local health systems in
the Americas.

     It asserts that knowledge of basic information about the
physical and social environment and discussion about
environmental issues at the local level can result in a high
degree of community participation and the involvement of
decision-makers.  This in turn can help to achieve a level of
health and well-being that is in keeping with the particular
circumstances and options of each local situation.

     The program is an adaptation for the Region based on the
"Programa Marco de Atención al Medio para los Equipos de
Atención Primaria de Navarra" [Framework Program on Care of the
Environment for Primary Health Care Teams in Navarra], co-
published by the Institute of Public Health of Navarra and
EURO/WHO in 1989.

     The document deals with various aspects of the environment
in general and their repercussions for health, and it identifies
working tools that can be used at the local level to promote
environmental health through appropriate diagnosis, surveillance,
follow-up, and evaluation of the environmental situation.

     A reading of the document by HPA in the context of health
promotion bears out the need to deepen the process of defining
roles for the different institutions and professionals and to
bring out other environmental aspects related to health promotion
that were not included which might add to the comprehensiveness
of its coverage.


Analysis Situation and Trend Assessment--HST

     This unit's contribution addresses some of the ideas and
actions involved in health promotion, disease prevention, and
curative activities within the framework of the program's
objectives.

     It is believed that social responses to health problems will
shape policies and plans for health and well-being which will be
translated into actions by society, groups, and individuals. 
These actions, in turn, can have an impact on the effects,
mediating processes, and/or conditions in which people live or
the determinants thereof.

     The actions can be developed on a step-wise basis in terms
of current living conditions and the level at which they will
have their greatest effect.

     On the basis of these elements, HST proposes a conceptual
model for the study of social problems and responses within the
context of living conditions.


Maternal and Child Health--HPM

     This contribution focuses on the development of a program in
adolescent health, which has been included as an example in the
basic document.

     The current situation with regard to adolescent health and
its determinants is reviewed, as well as the shortcomings of
existing institutions in dealing with the problem and offering
valid responses.

     The document gives examples of programs being carried out in
selected countries and describes a project for the implementation
of networks to develop work plans, share experiences, exchange
information, develop training programs, and provide leadership
throughout the Region in comprehensive adolescent health.

     The unit has also provided a report and supplementary
materials (manuals, standards, and programs) on the control of
diarrhea.


Emergency Preparedness and Disaster Relief--PED

     The contribution in this area covers basic concepts for
implementation of the promotion strategy in relation to
emergencies and disasters, highlighting the need to raise public
awareness of the risks associated with these situations.

     This consciousness-raising stage is prerequisite to the
implementation of participatory programs for prevention.

     The use of social communication and community participation
strategies will be fundamental to the achievement of these
objectives.


Health Services Development--HSD

     This unit is currently participating in a joint project on
"Healthy Municipios" as a strategy to advance social organization
and involve a maximum number of volunteers and resources in
health promotion.

     To this end, the project takes advantage of the political
and administrative base that is closest to the citizens and their
community structures.

     The "Healthy Municipios" movement in Latin America has been
included as an example in the basic document prepared by HPA.



Health Policies Development--HSP

     This unit is committed to fostering implementation of the
health promotion strategy through:

- Consideration of the subject in the context of activities with
parliaments and labor unions, as well as in exercises of socio-
political analysis.

- Consideration of the subject in courses under the various
projects, in sectoral analysis exercises, and in the advisory
group concerned with policies on care of the elderly.

- Consideration of the subject in PAHO/WHO policy documents
dealing with the financing of health services and the cost-
effectiveness of health promotion policies.

     A document was provided on health promotion policies as a
new challenge for international cooperation which summarizes the
concepts behind the health promotion strategy within the PAHO/WHO
primary health care strategy.

     The document underscores the importance of lifestyles and
social and individual responsibility for health, which are
included among the concepts that underlie the strategy, and it
points out some of the variations between them.

     A three-dimensional approach is presented for analyzing the
concept of lifestyles within the health promotion strategy, and
the document discusses the possible implications that its
implementation will have for international cooperation in the
countries of Latin America and the Caribbean in terms of the
formulation and execution of policies, plans, and programs.

     It suggests that cooperating agencies review their external
and internal activities with a view to applying the strategy in
the way that is most effective and most in keeping with the
sociocultural realities in the countries.


Communicable Diseases--HPT

     A description has been provided of activities under the
program that incorporate
