Issues 
   
   Crucial issues are at stake for general service staff in 1992, particularly since
the International Civil Service Commission (ICSC) is reviewing the methodology
used to determine the salaries and pensions of the general service categories.  This
led the Federation to create a working group to study the proposals, with particular
attention to the technical and political aspects of the review, so as to safeguard the
conditions of service and the interests of general service staff.
