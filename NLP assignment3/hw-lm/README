The files you will need for this assignment are not on the web.
You can find them on the ugrad network in /usr/local/data/cs465/hw-lm.

You will want to copy some of the code files to your own directory so
you can modify them.

It may be convenient to use symbolic links to avoid typing long filenames.
E.g., 
   ln -s /usr/local/data/cs465/hw-lm/english_spanish/train ~/estrain
will create a subdirectory "estrain" under your home directory.
But this subdirectory is really just a shortcut to the official
training directory.

As the assignment explains, the directory
/usr/local/data/cs465/hw-lm/code contains some code that you 
can run right away.
