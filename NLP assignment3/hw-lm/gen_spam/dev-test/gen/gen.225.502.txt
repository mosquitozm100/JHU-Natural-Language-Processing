SUBJECT: Hey Hi &NAME , how 's life ? How 's the teaching going ? I am listening to ' &NAME ' by Jars of &NAME on my &NAME player at the moment - I remember you used to like it . Actually , I think ' If I Left the &NAME ' is probably my favourite album of all time ; I just ca n't seem to get tired of listening to it ! It often reminds me of the ' MOG ' . I had such a good time doing that - it was a great idea of yours . I 'm enjoying my project work at the moment - quite a cushy life really . I work hard , but only during fairly civil hours ! I spoke to &NAME the other day - seems like ( as per ) she 's been through some pretty catastrophic stuff recently ! I met &NAME &NAME 's brother in &NAME bar the other day ( &NAME ) ! He 's at &NAME , and just about to finish his first year . I knew I recognised him from somewhere but I just could n't think where . Then he asked me if I 'd been at &NAME University and it suddenly clicked into place . Anyway , hope you 're well . Love &NAME
