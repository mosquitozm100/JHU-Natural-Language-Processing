SUBJECT: Your &NAME seminar Hi &NAME , The seminar starts at noon . The audience is typically a good mixture of &NAME , &NAME &NAME people . The usual format is a &NUM hour slot , with &NUM mins or so of presentation and the rest taken up with questions / discussion . We usually then retire to lunch in a nearby cafe . Will you be able to spend some time with us in the afternoon ? I 'm sure there are a number of people here who would welcome the opportunity to share ideas . Cheers , &NAME ps . Directions on how to get here can be found on the &NAME web site &WEBSITE
