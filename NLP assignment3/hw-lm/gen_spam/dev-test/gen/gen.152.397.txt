SUBJECT: Re : Assignment document &NAME , I have been tied up for the last few days , but will get you a considered response in the next few days . In principle it should be possible to tighten this clause up a bit to address your concern . When do you expect the shareholders agreement to be ready for us to look at ? &NAME <QUOTE> Thanks for your responses . I take the point about ensuring &NAME is exploitable , but am still uneasy over the rather vague wording . Since we are already offering a non-commercial licence and plan to publicise a commercial one as soon as we incorporate , perhaps a simple and easily verifiable condition that we do offer and continue to offer and publicise the offer of a non-exclusive commercial licence for the &NAME software would suffice and be straightforwardly verifiable ? best , &NAME <END_QUOTE>
