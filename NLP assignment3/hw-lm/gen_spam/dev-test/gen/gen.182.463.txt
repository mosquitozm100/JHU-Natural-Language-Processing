SUBJECT: Equipment &NAME If you are making grant application to a Research Council which has a large equipment component please read on . &NAME have recently turned down such an application ( from &NAME ) on the grounds that large items of equipment should be funded through the &NAME ( Scientific Research Infrastructure Fund ) &NUM initiative . This is causing the University to think about allocating some of its &NAME money for equipment --- possibly as much as 10M . We do n't know how much they will allocate , but a reasonable guess is that the &ORG will be able to bid for between &NAME and &NAME . The rules on what you can bid for are pretty simple : &CHAR ) anything that is coupled to a research application ( but I assume if the application is unsuccessful you lose the &NAME allocation ? ? ? ) ii ) anything that replaces or upgrades existing kit We have some ideas about ii ) , but I would be grateful to hear if anyone has ideas for &CHAR ) &NAME
