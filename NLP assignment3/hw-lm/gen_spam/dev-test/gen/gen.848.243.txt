SUBJECT: Re : &NAME &NAME &NAME : [ &NAME ] [ &NAME ] &NAME &NAME &NAME &NAME thanks I saw it earlier today . for some odd reason this looks almost identical to ANOTHER earlier &NAME : &WEBSITE also organised by the same people ( I think ) . ( I 've been asked to review for it and got that old &NAME + lutz stuff to do ) I could rehash some of that &NAME stuff , but I think it would be sexier to do something on co-training instead ( this can be thought of as similar to &NAME , but in a more constrained setting , so more likely to work ) . we 've got a paper at this year 's eacl on it ( and also &NUM at naacl too ) if you 'd like to read more about it . btw , as part of my fast-track grant I promised to add maxent parse selection to the &NAME / &NAME . for a variety of reasons , the student wo n't be able to do it . but , I could devote some time to it . would you like me to do this over the summer ? &NAME &NAME &NAME &NAME ( &EMAIL ) : <QUOTE> &NAME , &NAME - ------ Forwarded Message Return-path : ( &EMAIL ) Envelope-to : &EMAIL &NAME : Wed , &NUM Mar &NUM &NUM : &NUM : &NUM &NUM &WEBSITE ] ) &WEBSITE # &NUM ) id 18vf6o-0005rb-00 ; Wed , &NUM Mar &NUM &NUM : &NUM : &NUM &NUM &WEBSITE with local ( &NAME &NUM ) id 18vf1U-0007Wx-00 ; Wed , &NUM Mar &NUM &NUM : &NUM : &NUM &NUM &NAME ] &WEBSITE with esmtp ( &NAME &NUM ) id 18vJNe-0002H7-00 ; &NAME , &NUM Mar &NUM &NUM : &NUM : &NUM &NUM &WEBSITE ) [ &NUM ] &WEBSITE for &EMAIL with esmtp ( &NAME &NUM ) id 18vJNa-0000g5-00 ; &NAME , &NUM Mar &NUM &NUM : &NUM : &NUM &NUM &WEBSITE ] ) &WEBSITE ( &NUM / &NUM ) with &NAME id &NUM for ( &EMAIL ) ; &NAME , &NUM Mar &NUM &NUM : &NUM : &NUM &NUM &NAME : ( qmail &NUM invoked by uid &NUM ) ; &NUM Mar &NUM &NUM : &NUM : &NUM &NUM &NAME : &NAME , &NUM Mar &NUM &NUM : &NUM : &NUM &NUM From : &NAME &NAME &NAME ( &EMAIL ) To : &NAME &NAME &NAME ( &EMAIL ) Subject : [ &NAME ] [ &NAME ] &NAME &NAME &NAME &NAME &NAME : ( &EMAIL ) &NAME : &NUM &NAME : text / plain ; charsetus-ascii &NAME : inline &NAME : Mutt / 1.4i &NAME : Mutt &WEBSITE &NAME : &NUM days X-URL : &WEBSITE &NAME : en nl &NAME : &NAME &NUM &WEBSITE &NAME : &NAME , The &NAME , &NAME X-IRC : BitchX-1.0c19 ( internal version &NUM ) &NAME : No , &NAME &NAME &NAME : &NAME : by amavisd-milter ( &WEBSITE X-checked-clean : by exiscan on &NAME &NAME : &NAME &WEBSITE &NAME : NO &NAME : &NUM hits , &NUM required &NAME : spamassassin found ; * &NUM -- From and To the same address Sender : &EMAIL &NAME : bulk Call For Papers Special Issue on Grammatical Induction to be published in GRAMMARS a &NAME journal of Mathematical Research on Formal and Natural Languages &NAME editors : &NAME &NAME , &NAME &NAME , &NAME de la &NAME , &NAME &NAME &NAME Tentative deadlines : * Manuscript submissions : &NUM May &NUM * Referee comments sent back by : &NUM October &NUM * Revised manuscripts due : &NUM November &NUM * Notification of acceptance : &NUM December &NUM * &NAME manuscripts due : &NUM January &NUM * Issue will appear : May &NUM .

According to copyright policy , they must be considerably different from the version published in &NAME proceedings . Aims & Scope of GRAMMARS : GRAMMARS is an international forum for the dissemination of high-level original research in the intersection between mathematical / computational linguistics and formal language theory . The journal is based on the fact that a certain gap exists between linguists---trying to find adequate formal tools for natural language description and computer scientists---often unconcerned with the descriptive applicability of the generative devices they design . The aim of the journal is to bring both communities together and to provide a platform for discussion .
