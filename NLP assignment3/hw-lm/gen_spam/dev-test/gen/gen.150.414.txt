SUBJECT: Re : [ &NAME ] Is the &NAME a waste of time ? <QUOTE> to the verge of ignorance but am prepared to be told that I am being a bit old fashioned in my loyalty to the &NAME ! <END_QUOTE> I do n't know if it is out-of-date , but at the recent workshop on learner corpora at &NAME ( &NAME ) , I was on quite late in the programme , and was the first speaker to mention &NAME , a fact remarked upon positively ( ' at last ' , she said ) by &NUM member of the audience .
