SUBJECT: email Dear colleagues , I am collecting non-junk email for my project . If you get a chance , could you have a quick look at my ' anonymisation ' page , and if you 'd like to donate some emails for the ' greater good of the scientific community ' then I 'd love to hear from you . If not then no worries . ( obviously I do n't want any ' sensitive ' emails ! ) &WEBSITE If you do decide to donate some email , the easiest way to send me emails is to send the linux mail folder files themselves . These are usually located in ~/mail / ... Peace love and hope , &NAME
