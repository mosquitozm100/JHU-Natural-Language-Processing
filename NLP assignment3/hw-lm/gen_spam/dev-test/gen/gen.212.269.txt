SUBJECT: Re : &NAME / &NAME &NAME &NAME I sent this to you for information . I did not expect you to do anything . However , it is an advance warning that we may come under pressure to have externals for all thesis examining . &NAME <QUOTE> I 've got the letter from &NAME Friday to the Review Board wrt &NAME 's complaint ( which I have n't seen ) . I propose to do nothing about this , on the following basis : &NUM ) The letter is not to us and does n't ask us to do anything . &NUM ) &NAME 's dissertation was read by the ext . examiner and his oral was attended by him too . This is our standard practice wrt borderline candidates . &NUM ) The ext . examiner can recommend changes to int . examiners ' marks . &NUM ) Having the ext . examiner read all the dissertations , as opposed to a sample and all the borderline &NUM , would seriously increase the workload ( unnnecessarily ) and consequently make it hard to recruit any ext . examiner . Have I missed something ( other than the general zeitgeist , which I think is best resisted ) ? &NAME <END_QUOTE>
