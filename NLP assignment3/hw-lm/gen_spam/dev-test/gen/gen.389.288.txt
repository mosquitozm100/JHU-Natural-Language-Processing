SUBJECT: Re : Non-junk email Hi &NAME ! Your email would be very gratefully received . I 'm more concerned with genuine email , as I already have a LARGE amount of junk , extracted from an online archive . The easiest way to donate email is to simply send the back-end ' message folder ' files , which include all of the header info . For example , if you have a folder entitled ' msgs ' then it will appear as the file ' msgs ' in the ' ~/mail / ' folder wherever your email is stored ( i.e. in your hermes filespace ) , which can be accessed via ftp or similar . These files can be fed directly into the anonymiser . Thanks very much for your help &NAME , &NAME On &NAME , &NUM May &NUM , &NAME &NAME wrote : <QUOTE> Re : E-mail &NAME &NAME I get a fair bit of mail , junk and otherwise which I 'd be happy to donate , if anonymised . I currently use &NAME which , since tweaked , seems to do a fairly good job of filtering my mail , but I can always filter it out to you rather than marking it as &NAME and putting it in the trash . Let me know how you want the mail , whether you want mail forwarded , copied in its raw state ( including all headers ) or whatever . I do n't know whether you just want my &NAME account ( which is mainly &NAME stuff + &NAME ) or my general account e-mail too ( which includes stuff from outside uni , various ( high-traffic ) mailing lists , occassional random e-mail from someone who used my software which I wrote before coming to uni ( or a complaint from someone who 's been infected by a virus and thinks I gave it to them ) etc. I rarely get any viruses , since &NAME seems to stop prolific viruses in &NAME and my external account is scanned in &NAME , although I do get the empty messages without the worms ( hey , my &NAME folder is full of e-mails from &EMAIL at the moment ! ) . Let me know if & how I can assist anyway &NAME <END_QUOTE>
