SUBJECT: Re : part time phds &NAME - There was a slight confusion in your original message . Having studied as an undergraduate at &NAME does not mean that the student meets the residence requirement for the PhD . However , it does indicate that he is a &NAME graduate , and so could submit for a PhD under the special regulations , which would be much more appropriate for someone who was effectively external . You could advise him as you intended , but he would not have to pay any fees apart from a modest examination &NAME when he had published an appropriate amount of work . - &NAME .
