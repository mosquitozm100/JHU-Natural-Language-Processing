SUBJECT: &NAME for the Study of &NAME : Seminar this Thursday Dear All , This week ( Thursday 22nd May , at &NUM pm in the &NAME &NAME Theatre ) , &NAME &NAME from the &NAME &NAME , &NAME , will be talking on Exploring bacterial pathogen biology through genome sequencing . &NAME The talk will present data and analysis from a number of recent genome projects , mainly of human pathogens . These will include &NAME menigitidis , &NAME typhi , &NAME pestis and &NAME leprae . Data from primary and comparative analyses will be used to illustrate the multiple genetic mechanisms that these organisms use to evolve and adapt to their specific pathogenic niches . This should be an interesting and stimulating talk on bacterial evolution . Everybody is very welcome to attend . &NAME .
