SUBJECT: &NAME I have now had a reply from the &NAME to confirm their visit on the morning of &NUM May . I 've got the following names for the visit : &NAME &NAME &NAME &NAME &NAME &NAME &NAME &NAME &NAME &NAME &NAME &NAME &NAME &NAME &NAME &NAME &NAME &NAME &NAME &NAME ? From &NAME there will be &NAME &NAME and &NAME &NAME from the Computer Science part of the programme , &NAME &NAME who manages People and Interactivity , and &NAME &NAME who looks after Communications and Distributed Systems . They think it is often useful to have an initial chat and overview of the department , followed either by break out meetings with the various research groups , a tour , or a sequence of meetings . He thinks the most insightful conversations often occur over lunch or coffee , and so would appreciate such a session at the end of the visit . I think this means he 'd like a lunch at the end . Could you let me know if you are able to join in with a lunch and also let me know if I have missed you off this list ? I 'm not really sure what sort of programme they are expecting . Would this programme work though timing looks a bit tight ? &NUM &NUM &NAME &NAME &NAME &NUM &NUM &NAME &NAME &NUM &NUM Coffee &NUM &NUM &NAME &NAME &NUM &NUM &NAME &NAME and &NAME &NAME &NUM &NUM &NAME &NAME &NUM &NUM &NAME &NAME and &NAME &NAME &NUM &NUM &NAME &NAME &NUM &NUM Lunch &NUM &NUM &NAME I 'll book &NAME for lunch and coffee but perhaps the meetings would be better elsewhere . I do n't really see how I can make any bigger groups than I have done but suggestions for the programme welcomed . Thanks , &NAME
