SUBJECT: working party on fellowships Dear Fellows , Many of you may know that the college has set up a working party on fellowships . Its members are &NAME &NAME , &NAME &NAME , &NAME &NAME and myself as convenor . The working party will be looking at a range of issues involving the fellowship and the relationship between fellows and the college , including categories of fellowships ; different types of remuneration and benefits ; the balance between departmental and college activities ; and ways in which fellows can continue actively to contribute to the college . &NUM like to hear now from any fellows who have views , ideas or examples of good practice that might help us ( though it is possible too that we shall conduct a more formal survey of opinion in due course ) . Our first meeting is on Thursday , &NAME 27th , and so your contributions would be especially welcome before then . Do feel free to contact me or any other member of the working party . Many thanks , &NAME &NAME &EMAIL If you wish to be removed from this mailing list please send an email to &NAME Leader ( &EMAIL )
