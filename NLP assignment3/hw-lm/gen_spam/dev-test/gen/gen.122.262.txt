SUBJECT: email Hi &NAME , One of the guys who sent me some email to use just sent me the following : I 've been thinking ( always a dangerous thing ! ) Since e-mails are technically copyrighted by their authors , can I legally give you permission to incorporate this data ? Do I have the right to give you this permission ? Since the anonymiser significantly modifies the e-mail , does this change the copyright status ? Might just be worth you checking into some of these things before either of us becomes technically or actually liable . Regards , &NAME What do you think is the best form of reply to this sort of thing ? Cheers , &NAME
