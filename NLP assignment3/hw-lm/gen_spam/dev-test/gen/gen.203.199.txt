SUBJECT: Re : Past Presidents ' Politics ( Fwd ) To &NAME &NAME : I wanted to express my support for what you 've written . I could n't have expressed it better , but your letter echoes my own reaction to the initial past presidents ' letter . I 'm a bit confused by Ad &NAME 's letter , disagreeing with you having apparently said that ' an academic boycott is hence something that should not be debated by institutions like the &NAME . ' On the contrary : your letter states , ' As members of an academic association in this country , it is our right and our duty to engage in a debate on where and how to set the standards of academic practice and behaviour . It is also the right and duty of the leadership of any academic institution to engage in this debate . ' I take it , then , that you agree with Ad &NAME , who says ' I think we all have the intellectual responsibility to debate exactly these issues . ' Thank you for furthering this debate and pointing out some subtleties involved in the issue in question . &NAME &NAME
