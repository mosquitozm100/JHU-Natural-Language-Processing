SUBJECT: &NAME : [ &NAME ] French journal &NAME issue on &NAME in &NAME ( 2nd call ) [ &NAME if you receive multiple copies of this call . ] Call for papers for the special issue of the &NAME journal ( 2nd call ) &NAME : &NAME in &NAME Submission deadline : May 9th &NUM &NAME &NAME : C9ric de la &NAME ( &NAME , &NAME ) &NAME &NAME ( &NAME , &NAME ) &WEBSITE &NAME is a very important component in Natural Language Processing . It still raises many problems , for instance at the level grammatical formalisms or at the level of the algorithmic complexity , especially to handle ambiguity . However , because of recent advances , parsers are nowadays more and more widely used in large scale applications . Many approaches exist in the &NAME community that differ on the methods and objectives . The methods include for instance stochastic parsing , local parsing cascades , or more traditional complete or deep parsing . &NAME range from segmentation into chunks to deep parsing based on wide coverage grammars , including shallow and / or robust parsing . Anyway , these various methods and objectives are not necessarily in opposition and may be perceived as complementary . Despite the large number of existing grammatical formalisms , there are hints of convergences between them which open ways for ( partial ) conversions between formalisms ( for instance between &NAME and &NAME or &NAME and &NAME ) or toward ' operational ' formalisms . Also , some parsing techniques are ' generic ' and may be applied for several formalisms . Some parsing systems also aim to be multi-formalisms , relying on generic and efficient infrastructures ( indexing , memory management by structure sharing or copying , powerful unification ) . Finally , the notion of lexicalization is present in most formalisms . Last but not least , the generalization of parsers raises the issue of their evaluation . &NAME : The main objective of this special issue is a better understanding of the various approaches and techniques found in &NAME , highlighting the convergences and complementarities that may exist between them . We welcome works on any of the following issues . * Convergence between grammatical formalisms * conversions of formalisms * operational formalisms vs declarative &NUM * Convergence and complementarity in parsing approaches * robustness ( unknown words , error corrections ) * lexicalization * Integration of stochastic methods * Cascade parsing vs one-pass parsing * Evolution of parsing techniques for new formalisms * ( generic ) &NAME in &NAME * parsing strategies * ambiguity management * chart indexing * memory management ( structure sharing and copying ) * Wide coverage grammars * parsing efficiency * maintenance and modularity * &NAME evaluation Reviewers &NAME &NAME ( &NAME , &NAME ) &NAME &NAME ( University of &NAME , &NAME ) &NAME &NAME ( &NAME , &NAME ) &NAME &NAME ( University of &NAME , &NAME ) &NAME &NAME ( &NAME , &NAME ) &NAME &NAME ( LATTICE , &NAME ) &NAME &NAME ( University of &NAME , &NAME ) &NAME &NAME &NAME ( University of &NAME , &NAME ) &NAME &NAME ( &NAME , &NAME ) &NAME &NAME ( University of &NAME , &NAME ) &NAME &NAME ( &NAME &NAME University , &NAME ) &NAME &NAME ( University of &NAME , &NAME ) &NAME &NAME ( University of &NAME , &NAME ) &NAME &NAME ( UniversitE9 of &NAME , &NAME ) &NAME &NAME ( &NAME &NAME , &NAME ) Format Papers ( &NUM pages maximum ) may be submitted in &NAME , &NAME , &NAME or &NAME .
