SUBJECT: [ &NAME ] Speech register samples Greetings , I would like to find speech corpora of different registers of speech , e.g. , speech that is used in a particular situation , such as that of an elementary school teacher ( ' teacher talk ' ) , or speech from doctors to patients ( ' doctor talk ' ) , speech directed at non-native speakers , lectures , casual speech within social groups , etc. ANY amount will be of help to me . I 'll post a summary . Thank you in advance for your help ! This kind of material appears to be quite elusive . - &NAME &NAME
