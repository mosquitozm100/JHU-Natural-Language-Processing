SUBJECT: Re : &NAME Hi &NAME , here are some more comments . &NAME . Section &NUM : no full stop at end of sent with footnote &NUM &NAME output is not consistent : Figure &NUM does n't include positions whereas in section &NUM we have position numbers . Section &NUM : ( arg - &CHAR &CHAR - ) ( arg - &CHAR &CHAR - ) do you really mean for one of the args to have an extra space ? If they represent the same relations , they should look identical . When talkiing about table &NUM , you should say that mu represents the mean . Section &NUM : footnote &NUM should come after the full stop . Table &NUM : antecendent - ) antecedent Table &NUM reference in text +anaphora - ) +antecedent
