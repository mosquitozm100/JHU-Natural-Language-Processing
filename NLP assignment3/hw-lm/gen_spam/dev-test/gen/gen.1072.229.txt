SUBJECT: Re : eg here are the first &NUM examples of P1 / p_s with the &CHAR being a &NUM in file &NUM - I think they are all wrongly parsed . But perhaps the bad tokenization was interacting because I think it 's not as frequent as it was in the other file I was looking at . to do the semantics right for these , I 'd need to distinguish the subordinating conjunction case from the normal preposition case - they ideally need different types of tag entry ( because subordinating conjunctions are handle-taking ) . I can do this anyway since ( simplex ) prepositions are a closed class , so it 's not a problem - it 's just that I was looking at this &NAME it seemed an interesting case but then discovered there seemed to be errors &NAME ( |P1 / p_s | |in : &NAME | ( |S / np_vp | ( |NP / det_n1 | |the : &NAME | ( |N1 / &CHAR | |brain : &NAME | ) ) ( |V1 / v_pp | |follow+ed : &NAME | ( |PP / p1 | ( |P1 / p_np | |by : &NAME | ( |NP / det_n1 | |a : &NAME | ( |N1 / n_pp-of | |variety : &NAME | ( |PP / p1 | ( |P1 / p_np | |of : &NAME | ( |NP / n1-plu | ( |N1 / ap_n1/- | ( |AP / a1 | ( |A1 / a | |neurological : &NAME | ) ) ( |N1 / &CHAR | |disorder+s : &NAME | ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ( |P1 / p_s | |to : &NAME | ( |S / np_vp | ( |T / np_lmta | ( |NP / det_n1 | |the : &NAME | ( |N1 / &CHAR | |syndrome : &NAME | ) ) ( |Taph / &CHAR | |- : &NUM | ( |Tph / n1/--- | ( |N1 / n_ing | ( |T / n_lmta-r | |exhaustion : &NAME | ( |Taph / &CHAR | | , : &NUM , | ( |Tph / np/-- | ( |NP / n1-plu | ( |N1 / n1_n1-coord/+ | ( |N1 / n_n1/+ | |fever : &NAME | | , : &NUM , | ( |N1 / ap_n1/- | ( |AP / a1 | ( |A1 / a | |swollen : &NAME | ) ) ( |N1 / &CHAR | |gland+s : &NAME | ) ) ) | , : &NUM , | ( |N1 / n1_n1-coord/- | ( |N1 / ap_n1/- | ( |AP / a1 | ( |A1 / a | |disturbed : &NAME | ) ) ( |N1 / &CHAR | |sleep : &NAME | ) ) ( |N1 / cj-end_n1 | |and : &NAME | ( |N1 / ppart_n1-r/- | |fog+ed : &NAME | ( |N1 / &CHAR | |thinking : &NAME | ) ) ) ) ) ) ) | , : &NUM , | ) ) ( |V1 / adv_vp | ( |AP / a1 | ( |A1 / a | |all : &NAME | ) ) ( |V1 / vp_vp-coord-r/- | ( |V1 / &CHAR | |occur+ing : &NAME ( |V1 / cj-end_vp | |or : &NAME | ( |V1 / vp_pp | ( |V1 / vp_pp | ( |V1 / &CHAR | |recur+ing : &NAME ( |PP / p1 | ( |P1 / p_np | |for : &NAME | ( |NP / n1-plu | ( |N1 / n1_n1-coord/- | ( |N1 / &CHAR | |month+s : &NAME ( |N1 / cj-end_n1 | |or : &NAME | ( |N1 / &CHAR | |year+s : &NAME | ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ( |PP / p1 | ( |P1 / p_n1 | |on : &NAME | ( |N1 / &CHAR | |end : &NAME | ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) |- : &NUM | ) ) ( |V1 / be_np/--- | |be+ : &NAME | ( |NP / det_n1 | |the : &NAME | ( |N1 / n_pp-of | |result : &NAME | ( |PP / p1 | ( |P1 / p_np | |of : &NAME | ( |NP / n1-plu | ( |N1 / ap_n1/- | ( |AP / a1 | ( |A1 / a | |treatable : &NAME | ) ) ( |N1 / ap_n1/- | ( |AP / a1 | ( |A1 / a | |psychiatric : &NAME | ) ) ( |N1 / &CHAR | |disorder+s : &NAME | ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ( |P1 / p_s | |within : &NAME | ( |S / np_vp | ( |NP / det_n1 | |this : &NAME | ( |N1 / ap_n1/- | ( |AP / a1 | ( |A1 / a | |immunologic : &NAME | ) ) ( |N1 / n_s | |profile : &NAME | ( |S / comp | |that : &NAME | ( |S / np_vp | |we : &NAME | ( |V1 / do_np/- | |do : &NAME | |that : &NAME | ) ) ) ) ) ) ( |V1 / vp_pp | ( |V1 / be_ap/-- | |be+s : &NAME | ( |AP / a1 | ( |A1 / adv_a1 | ( |AP / a1 | ( |A1 / a | |always : &NAME | ) ) ( |A1 / a | |abnormal : &NAME | ) ) ) ) ( |PP / p1 | ( |P1 / p_np | |in : &NAME | ( |NP / n1-plu | ( |N1 / n-name_n1 | |CFS : &NAME | ( |N1 / &CHAR | |patient+s : &NAME | ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ( |P1 / p_s | |from : &NAME | ( |S / np_vp | ( |NP / det_n1 | |the : &NAME | ( |N1 / ap_n1/- | ( |AP / a1 | ( |A1 / a | |larger : &NAME | ) ) ( |N1 / &CHAR | |study : &NAME | ) ) ) ( |V1 / vp_pp | ( |V1 / be_ppart/- | |be+ : &NAME | ( |V1 / not_vp | |not+ : &NAME | ( |V1 / &CHAR | |expect+ed : &NAME | ) ) ) ( |PP / p1 | ( |P1 / p_a | |until : &NAME | |late : &NAME | ) ) ) ) )
