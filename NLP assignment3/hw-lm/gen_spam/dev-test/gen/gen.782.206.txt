In many cases , the only way to access such documents is through blunt instruments such as keyword-based document retrieval . In recent years , there has been significant research ( and considerable commercial interest ) in technologies for automatically extracting and mining useful structured knowledge from unstructured text . Current trends suggest a movement away from pure natural language processing approaches requiring the manual development of rules , to a shallower , less knowledge intensive techniques based on techniques from machine learning , information retrieval and data mining . Adaptive text extraction and mining is an enabling technology with a wide variety of applications . On the Web , automated knowledge capture from text would open the way for both better retrieval , and advanced business applications ( e.g. B2B / B2C applications mediated by knowledge-aware agents ) . For knowledge management , capturing the knowledge contained in a companys repositories would encourage knowledge to be shares and reused among employees , improving efficiency and competitiveness . Extracting information from texts is an important step in capturing knowledge , e.g. for populating databases or ontologies , supporting document &NAME ( e.g. for the Semantic Web ) , for learning ontologies , etc. THE WORKSHOP The workshop will bring together researchers and practitioners from different communities ( e.g. machine learning , text mining , natural language processing , information extraction , information retrieval , ontology learning ) to discuss recent results and trends in mining texts for knowledge capture . Members of other communities ( e.g. information integration and data mining ) could find the workshop very interesting as well . Previous workshops on the use of machine learning for information extraction were held at &ORG-1998 , ECAI-2000 , and IJCAI-2001 . AREAS OF INTEREST Areas of interest for the workshop include ( but are not limited to ) : * machine learning and natural language * learning to annotate documents * ontology learning * information retrieval and learning * information integration from textual and multimedia resources * relevant aspects of human-computer interaction and semi-supervised learning SUBMISSION DETAILS ATEM-2003 will accept &NUM types of submissions : long papers that describe completed research ( maximum &NUM pages ) ; and short papers that describe ongoing work or challenging ideas ( maximum &NUM pages ) . The most interesting papers presented at the workshop will be considered for a special issue of a scientific journal . Manuscripts should be formatted for &NAME paper , and must be submitted in either &NAME or Postscript format . Send submissions to ' &WEBSITE ' with the subject ' &NAME submission ' . IMPORTANT DATES Please note the following deadlines : - Paper submission deadline : Friday &NUM June &NUM - Paper acceptance notification : Friday &NUM July &NUM - Paper camera-ready deadline : Friday &NUM July &NUM - &NAME date : Monday &NUM September &NUM [ tentative ] JOINT TUTORIAL Researchers who are interested but not yet involved in adaptive text extraction and mining are encouraged to attend the tutorial ' Information Extraction from Web Documents ' at &ORG-2003 . This introductory tutorial has been organized by the workshop chairs to complement the research focus of ATEM-2003 . SPONSORSHIP The workshop will be partly funded by a grant from the European Project ' &WEBSITE ' .
