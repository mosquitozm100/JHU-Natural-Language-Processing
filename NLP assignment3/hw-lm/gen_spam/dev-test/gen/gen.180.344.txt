SUBJECT: &NAME New Year ! Greetings ! We 've certainly lost touch , have n't we ? I saw your new book advertised in a &NAME brochure ( congratulations ) . It was quite strange , really : when I saw the &NAME return address on the envelope and started to open it , I actually thought of you before I 'd even seen the brochure . So I figured I was meant to email . Your career seems to be thriving , so I hope that means you are , too . And my &NAME , you 're now over &NUM ! ! ! I turn &NUM tomorrow , so no sympathy from me for a youth such as you . I hope all is going well ( seems like it ) , and that you 're still biking , fencing , and whatnot . Do you even get over here to the land of ice and snow , or are you pretty much Euro-focused these days ? ? ? Take care , and all the best , &NAME
