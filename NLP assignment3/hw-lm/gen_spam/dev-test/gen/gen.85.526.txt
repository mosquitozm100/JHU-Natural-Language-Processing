SUBJECT: emails Hi &NAME , I 'm beginning to assemble my non-spam email corpus , and I wondered if you could send me any that you are willing to part with . Also , after reading some of the papers for the reading club , I 'm wondering about the idea of applying some variant of the language modelling technique to the email classification problem . I have some ideas that might be quite interesting to look into . Anyway , speak soon , &NAME
