SUBJECT: [ &NAME ] &NAME &NAME : CoNLL-2003 : &NAME Conference on Natural Language Learning ( apologies for duplicates ; note &NAME &NAME will be our invited speaker ) FINAL CALL FOR PAPERS CoNLL-2003 : &NAME Conference on Natural Language Learning Organized at &ORG-03 , &NAME , &NAME May &NUM - June &NUM &NUM &WEBSITE &NAME is an international forum for discussion and presentation of research on natural language learning . We invite submission of papers about natural language learning topics , including , but not limited to : - Computational models of human language acquisition - Computational models of the origins and evolution of language - &NAME learning methods applied to natural language processing tasks ( speech processing , phonology , morphology , syntax , semantics , discourse processing , language engineering applications ) - &NAME learning methods ( Rule Induction and Decision &NAME &NAME , &NAME &NAME , Inductive Logic &NAME , &NAME &NAME , &NAME &NAME &NAME ) - Biologically-inspired methods ( &NAME &NAME , &NAME &NAME ) - Statistical methods ( &NAME &NAME , &NAME , maximum entropy , &NAME , Support Vector Machines ) - &NAME &NAME - &NAME learning , ensemble methods , meta-learning - &NAME &NAME &NAME analysis of language learning - Empirical and theoretical comparisons of language learning methods - Models of induction and analogy in &NAME &NAME is the yearly meeting organized by &NAME , the &ORG Special Interest Group on Natural Language Learning . Previous &NAME meetings were held in &NAME ( &NUM ) , &NAME ( &NUM ) , &NAME ( &NUM ) &NAME ( &NUM ) , &NAME ( &NUM ) , and &NAME ( &NUM ) . See &WEBSITE for more information about &NAME and &NAME . Special Theme As in previous years , in addition to submissions on the general topics listed above , we encourage submissions on a special theme . This year 's special theme is : Semi-supervised / unsupervised learning and sample selection techniques for language learning ( co-training , active learning , &NAME , etc ) . Supervised &NAME &NAME methods suffer from a ' data &NAME bottleneck ' which is especially harmful for language learning tasks where a lot of training data is needed ( e.g. parsing ) . Sample selection techniques , and combination of supervised learning with semi-supervised and unsupervised techniques may provide a solution to this problem . Shared &NAME This year 's workshop will also accept submissions for a shared task : machine learning approaches to named entity recognition . Special attention will be given to the use of multiple sources of knowledge , like training data , lists of examples and unannotated data . Interested groups will be supplied with the same training and testing material ( in several languages ) , and will all use the same evaluation criteria , thus allowing comparison between various learning methods . More information on the shared task is available at : &WEBSITE Invited Speaker &NAME ABNEY Understanding the &NAME &NAME Submissions * &NAME &NAME &NAME Submit a full paper of no more than &NUM pages ( &NAME , &NAME or plain text &NAME ) by March &NUM , &NUM electronically to the address below . Authors of accepted submissions will be invited to produce a final paper to be published in the proceedings of the workshop , which will be available at the workshop for participants , and distributed afterwards by &NAME . &NAME submissions must follow the &ORG style ( &WEBSITE We strongly recommend the use of these style files also in the submission .
