The major changes are : &NUM Our address has changed to ' &NAME ' and ' Block &NUM ' &NUM I have added the &NAME Guide to Authors and Artwork Instructions links instead of the &NAME website links ( now defunct ) &NUM I have removed the &NAME link to the Latex instructions and added the link to the &NAME &NAME instructions &NUM I 've removed the copyright form as we no longer ask authors to complete it at this stage - the Production department send out the forms as a matter of course .
