SUBJECT: &NAME Research Lecture : Speaker : &NAME &NAME &NAME : &NAME : Self-Aware Networks and Quality of Service &NAME RESEARCH LECTURE SPEAKER : &NAME &NAME &NUM HOST : &NAME &NAME DATE : Wednesday &NUM January &NUM TIME : &NUM : &NUM - &NUM : &NUM PLACE : &NAME Research Ltd &NUM &CHAR &CHAR &NAME Avenue ( Off &NAME Road ) &NAME TITLE : &NAME &NAME and Quality of Service We will describe a self-aware packet network design that uses smart and ACK packets to collect and store data about network state . Smart packets also search for routes using QoS criteria suggested by users . Connections then forward their payload using dumb packets along routes which have been discovered by smart packets . Extensive experiments on several tast-beds we have implemented , based on wired and ad-hoc wireless connectivity , will be described . &NAME &NAME : &NAME &NAME is the University Chair Professor and Director of the School of &NAME at &NAME . A Fellow of &NAME and the &NAME , his interests span neural computation , computer networks , and computer and network performance evaluation and &NAME . In &NUM he was awarded the medal of Officer of the National Order of Merit of &NAME for his research contributions .
