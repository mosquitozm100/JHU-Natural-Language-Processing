SUBJECT: Paper corrections Hi &NAME , I 've read through the qa / anaphora paper and here are some comments : &NUM ) Section &NUM : do you really mean that ' The &NAME system recovers &NAME representations ' ? &NUM ) Tables and figures seem to be rather confused in the first half of the paper . The &NAME output should probably be &NUM huge figure with a caption ( it does n't have one now and so it merges in with the table below , it 's also odd that you 're referring to Figure &NUM when you 've never referred to Figure &NUM ) . &NUM ) Section &NUM : Table &NUM gives the mean reciprocal rank ... This should be Table &NUM . &NUM ) Section &NUM : ... unanswered questions by about &NUM -- you need to backslash the % sign . &NUM ) Section &NUM : ... weights selected are valid -- see Table &NUM . This should be Table &NUM ! &NUM ) Section &NUM : Why are the definite descriptions in Table &NUM being referred to as interD -- can you not have intraD too ? How about ' &NAME &NAME , the president of the club , ... ' ? &NUM ) Section &NUM : ... is not sufficient ( contx- , i.e. where ... Needs a ~ sign between i.e. and where - ) i.e. ~where &SMILEY Section &NUM : missing reference : @inproceedings { Kennedy : &NUM , AUTHOR ' &NAME &NAME and &NAME &NAME ' , TITLE ' &NAME for Everyone : &NAME &NAME Resolution without a &NAME ' , BOOKTITLE ' Proceedings of the 16th International Conference on Computational Linguistics ( { COLING }' &NUM ) ' , YEAR &NUM , PAGES { 113--118 }} &NUM ) Section &NUM : ... given in Figure &NUM - ) needs to change figure number . &NUM ) Section &NUM : All of &NAME 's non-coreference ... Also need to add that the salience factors can be obtained from the GRs . &NUM ) Section &NUM : &NAME and &NAME forthcoming : rather optimistic is n't it ? Maybe it 'd be better to cite my &NAME paper . That 's got all the same results except for &NAME and is already published . @inproceedings { Preiss : &NUM , AUTHOR { J . Preiss } , TITLE { Choosing a &NAME for &NAME Resolution } , BOOKTITLE { Proceedings of DAARC } , YEAR &NUM , PAGES { 175--180 }} &NUM ) Section &NUM : I 'd rather not give the optimal weights . These were n't obtained from the manual re-annotation and I did n't use them in the stuff that I gave you , so it 'd invite too much criticism ( from myself if not form anyone else ! ) . &NUM ) I like your ' The results were &NAME ' ! &NUM ) Section &NUM : stat-of-the-art - ) state-of-the-art &NUM ) Section &NUM : ... other statistical parsers ( e.g. &NAME ... Are n't you using statistical in a rather non-technical sense ? I do n't think that you can say that &NAME ' stuff is statistical . &NAME that helps , thanks for writing the paper in the first place . See you tomorrow , &NAME .
