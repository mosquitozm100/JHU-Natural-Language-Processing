SUBJECT: Re : &NAME cvs <QUOTE> I going soon to be making changes to files that are part of release &NUM , but the changes should not be included in the release . <END_QUOTE> Can we not just freeze the first release ? That would mean re-creating the binaries , but then we could just start working on version &NUM ... We 'd have to freeze the files that you 're about to work on anyway , so there would n't be any debugging benefits from not freezing it . <QUOTE> &WEBSITE so it goes into the release tar file ? <END_QUOTE> Done . &NAME .
