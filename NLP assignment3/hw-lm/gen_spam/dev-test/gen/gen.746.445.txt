SUBJECT: Re : [ &NAME ] &NAME Hello again , I would like to thank every person who took the time to answer my question about synonyms and the use of quantitative methods to analyze them . I received numerous helpful links and materials ( see below for a summary ) . Thank you to &NAME &NAME , &NAME &NAME , &NAME &NAME &NAME , &NAME &NAME , &NAME &NAME , &NAME &NAME , &NAME &NAME and &NAME &NAME . I forgot to translate the &NUM words I am interested in : Italian ' perfino ' and ' persino ' ' even ' ( as a focus particle ) . They are function words and therefore it would ( maybe ? ) be even be more surprising to have &NUM identical forms here . From some preliminary tests , however , they seem very close indeed . What I am wondering about is , if I use quantitative measures , such as the z-score , what would be a sufficient difference between &NUM measures ( the point of delicacy or resolution ) to distinguish synonyms from near-synonyms ?

I am currently working on &NUM Italian words ( ' perfino ' and ' persino ' ) , which I suspect to be absolute synonyms . My goal is to demonstrate their synonymy by using quantitative methods ( I will use the Italian corpus &NAME , not yet pos-tagged ) . I was wondering if anybody could refer me to similar studies or could give me a hint of how to procede . Any suggestion if welcome !
