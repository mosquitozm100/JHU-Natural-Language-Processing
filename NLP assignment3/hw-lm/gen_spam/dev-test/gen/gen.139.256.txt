SUBJECT: Re : Make up for &NUM / &NUM OK - I think we were slightly at cross purposes here - when I was the reviews editor and the journal was run from &NAME I dealt directly with &NAME , but I 'm perfectly happy the copy comes via &NAME on its way across &NAME ! &CHAR <QUOTE> <QUOTE> &NAME was this review ever sent to &NAME for &NUM / &NUM or was it not needed in the end ? I presume its the review from &NAME &NAME from September . <END_QUOTE> I NEVER send anything direct to &NAME -- I 've always sent completed and checked reviews to you , so that you could liaise with &NAME about which volume to put them in. &NUM think this is still the most sensible way to proceed . &NAME <END_QUOTE>
