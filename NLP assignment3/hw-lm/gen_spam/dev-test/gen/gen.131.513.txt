SUBJECT: linguistics as a science Dear Prof. &NAME , I am a &NAME senior writing a thesis on &NAME &NAME 's attacks on &NAME linguistics as a science , as represented in his book _Empirical Linguistics_ . As he refers to &NUM articles of yours ( ' English noun phrases are regular : a reply to Professor &NAME ' &NUM ; ' Robust stochastic parsing using the inside-outside algorithm ' &NUM ) I was wondering if you could possibly forward to me copies of these articles or any other that you might think useful to me , or if you could otherwise direct me to them . Thank you very much for your time ! Sincerely , &NAME &NAME &NAME &NAME &NAME &NUM &NAME Mail Center &NAME , MA &NUM &NUM
