Aims & Scope of GRAMMARS : GRAMMARS is an international forum for the dissemination of high-level original research in the intersection between mathematical / computational linguistics and formal language theory . The journal is based on the fact that a certain gap exists between linguists---trying to find adequate formal tools for natural language description and computer scientists---often unconcerned with the descriptive applicability of the generative devices they design . The aim of the journal is to bring both communities together and to provide a platform for discussion .
