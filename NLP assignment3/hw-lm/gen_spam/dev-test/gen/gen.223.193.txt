SUBJECT: Re : &NAME warning Re this extraordinary stuff from the &NAME - &NUM min breakdown no non-examined lectures is * anybody * in the &NAME resisting this sort of crap ? &NAME may think they are promoting better higher education but what they are actually doing is destroying it . ( or shd one just be cynical and tell lies , or waffle on about the fact that any material in any lecture can be some sort of prerequisite / background for some exam question in the sense that knowing it will support better motivated answers to the actual questions asked . ... ) I am saddened by the fact that , going through slides of some of &NAME 's talks , it 's clear that though they give the very solid framework , what he actually said was what mattered ; and while he certainly had more detailed notes for undergraduate lecturing , the idea that what he said as opposed to what the students were supplied in written form with was &NAME ornament or reiteration is really lowering . And I bet that the more you go the &NAME cut and dried route the less likely you are as a lecturer to be remembered &NUM or &NUM years later , as I have had messages saying about &NAME . &NAME
