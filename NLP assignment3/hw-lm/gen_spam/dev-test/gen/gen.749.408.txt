SUBJECT: [ &NAME ] Corpus Linguistics &NUM conference 3rd &NAME CORPUS LINGUISTICS &NUM &NAME University ( UK ) , &NUM March - &NUM April &NUM THIRD CALL FOR PAPERS AND WORKSHOPS Corpus Linguistics &NUM will be a forum for all concerned with the computer-assisted empirical analysis of natural language . Our definition of ' corpus ' is broad , and we therefore welcome those working on substantial literary texts or other kinds of text collection as well as more ' traditional ' corpus &NAME . Similarly , we wish to encourage further cross-fertilization between work occurring in language engineering ( e.g. information extraction , parsing ) and linguistics . We believe that corpus &NAME should be aware of the late st developments in language processing . We also believe that language engine ers should be aware of the findings and needs of corpus &NAME . The conference will include invited talks from : &NAME &NAME - &NAME and the lexicon &NAME &NAME - topic &NAME &NAME &NAME - topic &NAME &NAME &NAME - Everything you wanted to know about the American National Cor pus ... but were afraid to ask The aims of Corpus Linguistics &NUM are : &NUM to encourage dialogue between those working on similar issues in diffe rent languages and between areas with a ( perhaps as yet untapped ) potential to interact . &NUM to encourage dialogue between researchers using corpora in linguistics and those using corpora in language engineering .
