SUBJECT: Re : [ Fwd : Request to review paper &NAME &NUM SOrry not to respond more rapidly to this - been in &NAME - and in &NAME now . ... &NAME next week ( I hope ) . &CHAR <QUOTE> <QUOTE> Is the timescale the primary problem , or the quality issue ? I decided to do the proofing myself to expedite things , but we could easily change that . <END_QUOTE> I do n't want to do proofreading ( free or paid ) for &NAME on any timescale . I already check the substantive content of reviews and negotiate with reviewers if necessary . <QUOTE> Incidently , you are acknowledged inside the front cover ... <END_QUOTE> So I am -- apologies for that bit of the rant ... I have a suggestion for a streamlined book reviewing procedure -- add my addr to the inside front cover as the addr for publishers to send review copies with a note that unsolicited books not appropriate for review will not be returned . I 'll handle the reviewing process up to the point where I have an acceptable review ( as outlined in the previous email ) . Then I 'll send it to &NAME , if you like cced to you or someone in &NAME . After that you and &NAME can take over wrt publication issue , proofing , production etc That way , we 'll reduce &NAME 's load and I wo n't waste my time sending her emails she apparently loses , or farting about with her spreadsheets recording who is reviewing what etc. I will , of course , keep track here of who is reviewing what , and it would be nice if &NAME cld manage to pay the surface mail costs of forwarding books ( e.g. via an annual bill from our accnts dept. ) &NAME <END_QUOTE>
