SUBJECT: Fwd : &NAME / &NAME &NAME &NAME ' &NUM and &NAME SI ( Fwd ) &NAME / &NAME / &NAME Below is an email thread relating to a proposal for a special issue on Speaker &NAME . The plan would be for a double issue in &NAME &NUM . The guest editor will by &NAME &NAME &NAME from &NAME &NAME &NAME &NAME + a second US editor to be decided . I support this proposal . Does everyone else agree ? &NAME &NAME , Further to the above and addressing the issues you raised , the views of the &NAME are that : &CHAR ) &NAME &NAME &NAME would be &NUM &NAME , another ( probably US-side ) to be agreed . &EMAIL &CHAR ) we should aim for 4th qurater ' &NUM &CHAR ) we should request a double issue based on ~5 papers / issue What is now to do to get formal agreement ?

I 'll put these points to the &NAME . I know there is a strong view that the time between the &NAME and publication of the SI should be short as possible ( without compromising standards ) . As to number of papers , my guess would be possibly as many &NUM given the status of the meetings , but we could simply restrict it to the &NUM or &NUM for &NUM issue . Otherwise , all seems well . I 'll cc send this message to the &NAME for comment .

To move forwards , we need more information &CHAR ) We will need the names of the guest editors to be appointed - preferably &NUM . &CHAR ) We need a draft schedule to publication so that we can identify the best issue to allocate to you . I assume that you will select authors at or around the time of the workshop . You then need to give them time to produce the full paper , send it out to referees , allow revisions , final review and accept . ( This looks to me like 4th quarter &NUM or 1st quarter &NUM ) &CHAR ) A single issue of &NAME will accommodate &NUM or &NUM papers . To accommodate more we would have to make it a double issue . How many papers do you anticipate accepting ? If you can answer the above , then the editors can make a final decision . Note that we expect the same quality standards as for regular submissions to &NAME . Each accepted paper must have been reviewed by &NUM independent reviewers . The guest editors make the accept / reject decision but one of the regular &NAME editors is assigned to assist in the process ( probably me in this case ) . If you have detailed questions about publication procedures , please contact &NAME van der &NAME at &NAME ( for email see cc list ) . &NAME <QUOTE> &NAME , I 've been asked to follow-up some previous emails ( copied below ) . In brief , &NAME ' &NUM and &NAME &NAME &NAME &NUM workshops are seeking a journal special issue . The relevant &NAME is attached . In essence we 'd like to repeat the successful previous &NAME practice : selected papers for a journal SI . Last time it was with &NAME and this time we 'd like a more speech related one , our first preference being &NAME . A key factor is publication date : this should be as soon after &NAME date ( &NAME &NUM ) as possible . What are your thoughts ? I 've attached below some history emails .
