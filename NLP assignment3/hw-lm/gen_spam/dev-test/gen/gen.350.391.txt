SUBJECT: [ Fwd : Re : Thesis returned ] Hi -- &NAME &NAME seems to be in a tizzy after his meeting with you . I guess the point is for him to find a project that would let him develop some skills in corpus work , independent of the framework he presents his results in ? Or did you really advise him not to do a thesis in &NAME ? - &NAME Dear Doctor &NAME , I have just come back from my interview at &NAME with Doctor &NAME and Doctor &NAME . They agree to take me in. They have asked me about what I would like to do for my summer project . I tell them that I want to try testing my PhD project , that is , treating agreement as a function from semantic structures to syntactic structures , with &NAME . But then I learn that Doctor &NAME is basically a &NAME person and Doctor &NAME a Categorial Grammar person . So I suggest something to do with the &NAME system whose manual you have given me to have a look . However , Doctor &NAME suggests that the best project for me in this summer would be something that requires me to use some unix tools to do some text searching , extraction so that I can familiar myself with these skills normally possessed by &NAME graduates . Of course , I know that this is only the methodology to do a project . I still have to get a theme . The problem is I know absolutely nothing about the methodology . So I have no idea of what it is capable to do ? Can you suggest some reports of projects done by others for me to read so that I can get some ideas of what I can do ? Or do you have something that you find interesting ? Doctor &NAME asks me to say hello to you . I am looking forward to seeing you . Enjoy your trip in &NAME . Respectfully yours , &NAME &NAME &NAME
