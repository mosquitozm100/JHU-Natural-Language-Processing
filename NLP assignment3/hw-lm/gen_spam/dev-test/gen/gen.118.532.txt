SUBJECT: permission to continue &NAME , I can confirm that you are allowed to continue . You should have had a letter by now - I wonder if it was sent to the wrong address or something ? The letter says something to the effect that you are allowed to continue but you should be aware that you are in danger of failing the course if your performance does n't improve next year . In fact , you are only slightly below the pass &NAME , so while we 'd hope that you could do much better next year , it 's not the case that you have to make up a large gap to pass . &NAME
