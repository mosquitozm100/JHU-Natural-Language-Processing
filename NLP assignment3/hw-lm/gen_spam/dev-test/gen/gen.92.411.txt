SUBJECT: &NAME letter &NAME , The &NAME immigration service form does not say much regarding what is needed as evidence of my relationship with &NAME . It appears that it would be sufficient for you to provide us with a letter which states that we ( &NAME &NAME &NAME and &NAME &NAME &NAME &NAME ) have been living together as joint tenents of &NUM &NAME Walk from &NUM / &NUM / &NUM . Sorry I ca n't give you much more than that , it 's a very vague form Thanks &NAME
