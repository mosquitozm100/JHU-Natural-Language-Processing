SUBJECT: [ &NAME ] &NAME &NAME &NUM I have created an alphabetic version of WordNet &NUM with my DIMAP dictionary maintenance programs and made them available at &WEBSITE with DIMAP for Windows ; a demo version is also available . There are &NUM , &NUM entries in the alphabetic WordNet , containing virtually all information available in WordNet converted into DIMAP analogs ( all relations and all glosses ) . With &NAME , you can perform regular expression searches on any field and convert all or selected WordNet data into a format of your choosing ( an &NAME template is provided for converting all the WordNet data into &NAME ) . Please direct any questions , comments , or suggestions directly to me , rather than the WordNet staff , who have had no direct involvement in my conversion ( other than being aware of it ) . &NAME &NAME &NAME &NAME . : &NUM &NAME Research EMAIL : &EMAIL &NUM &NAME Road &NAME , &NAME &NUM &NAME &NAME &NAME : &WEBSITE
