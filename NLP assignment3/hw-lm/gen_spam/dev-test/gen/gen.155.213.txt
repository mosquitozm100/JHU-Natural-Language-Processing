SUBJECT: Account Hi &NAME , I wonder if you could do me a quick favour to make sure that I do n't lose my &NAME email account during my year out ? &NAME &NAME ( &EMAIL ) would just like a short note to confirm that I need my email account for academic purposes . I 'm doing some travelling now and expect to come &NAME to graduate early next year . My college gave me a prize for my performance on the &NAME course , which was a nice surprise ! I hope all 's well with the new &NAME bunch . All the best , &NAME <QUOTE> &NAME , To keep your accounts for longer than a &NUM month period you will need to get authorisation sent to us ( an e-mail will be fine ) from your department , stating that you will be using your account for academic purposes . <END_QUOTE>
