SUBJECT: Fellows ' photographs Dear Fellows We have a Fellows ' photograph album in the &NAME . In the past every new Fellow has been asked to submit a photograph for it . The album has proved very useful for new Fellows in identifying old &NUM , and for old Fellows in identifying new &NUM . It also provides lots of amusement . When a Fellow leaves , the photograph goes into the archive - for ever . We are often asked by press and publishers for copies of such photographs , and indeed they expect us always to have them . Unfortunately , in recent years , Fellows have been very bad at responding to the request for a photo , and I believe also that in the last year or &NUM the responsibility for making the request has fallen between &NUM stools . As a result the photograph album is losing both its usefulness and its entertainment value . I am also aware that a number of Fellows will be leaving shortly and we shall have no photographic record at all . THIS MESSAGE IS A PLEA FOR A PHOTOGRAPH OF YOU - if you know we do n't have one already . The convention used to be for a studio portrait ( one of the reasons we stopped getting them , I suspect ) ; however , we should be happy to accept anything , however snappy . If sending as a jpeg is easier , then so be it . Please send your photograph to me as soon as possible , and thank you in advance for your co-operation in contributing to &NAME 's historical record .
