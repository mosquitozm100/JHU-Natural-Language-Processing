SUBJECT: Re : &NAME &NUM mins out of town ... this is bad planning ... I was rather fancying hanging out by the river , dropping into the &NAME , and the like . I 'm all for staying downtown . How about revisiting the Coling-88 acomodation arrangements ? I recall they had a couple of hotels down by the river , where we stayed , as well as something on the hill on the other side of the &NAME ... B. : ) anything about the &NUM and only conference hotel : is it miles from : ) anywhere , and is &NUM likely to be cooped for a week : ) with a bunch of &NAME types ... : about &NUMins out of town -- how about we both stay downtown and : commute out to the conference ?
