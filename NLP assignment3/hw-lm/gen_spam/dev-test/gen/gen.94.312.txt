SUBJECT: Re : &NAME parses &NAME - I 'm looking at the &NAME parses for q2 and q3 . I 've noticed that the tags on constructions like $ &NUM , &NUM are now showing as $ &NAME and &NUM , &NAME whereas in &NAME the tag on the amount would be &NAME . Other money constructions do show up with the &NAME tag in &NAME , usually when it includes a &NAME like million , etc. Is this a function of the tagger , or is this by design ? Thanks , eh
