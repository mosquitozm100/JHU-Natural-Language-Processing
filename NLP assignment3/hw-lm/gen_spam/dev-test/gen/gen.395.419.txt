SUBJECT: ( ( nlp and web based context ) ) Dear Dr. &NAME : I am interested in undertaking a Ph. &NAME , in Computer Science at &NAME ( was there last year per &NAME ) and I am trying to find a potential supervisor ( i.e. , you or someone you suggest in &NAME group ) for my interests : context--awareness * of spatial interaction ( very similar to nlp but involves visual symbols ) and the web , &NAME , the philosophy of representation I finish my M.S. here at &ORG later this month -- I am a student in a niche area of computer science here called ( &NAME ) Planning Support Systems ( which is primarily databases and graphics related &NAME ) . My thesis project involves the development of a prototype for ' context-aware ' location based information delivered via the wireless web . This project has been supervised by &NAME &NAME -- head of context-aware computing -- at the Media Lab ; here is some info about my stuff : &WEBSITE Here a cv for brief sketch of my background : &WEBSITE I would like to continue to work in similar projects ( if not this one that I started ) and I know your group does some cool stuff -- I took &NAME there last year .

I have been shortlisted for the * &NAME &NAME &NAME * and will be interviewed next week ( Thursday by phone ) -- my application is sort of in limbo at the moment until I find a new advisor at &NAME -- I initially applied to &NAME IS / OR but they do n't do hard-core computing . Any advice would be highly appreciatted .
