SUBJECT: Re : &NAME jnls for &NUM ? I had sent them &NAME , but I 'll package up &NUM and resend them tomorrow . I also checked the mailing labels I 'd sent to &ORG Press journals for &NUM to be mailed out by them as soon as the books are done and you are definitely on that list .

References : ( &EMAIL ) &NAME : text / plain ; charsetus-ascii &NAME : 7bit Oh dear , &NAME ! I , too , remember saying I 'd add a year to your membership to compensate for the problems we had . Seems I forgot to add the ' &NUM ' that would have generated your name on the mailing label lists for the journals . I will fix this today and get those journals ( &NUM ) out to you right away .

I dimly recall last year that I got &NUM copies of the journal and that there was also some mix up over my subscription so that I paid twice and you rolled over the second payment for this year .
