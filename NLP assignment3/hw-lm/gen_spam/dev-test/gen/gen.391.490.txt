SUBJECT: Guide to Domestic Departments <QUOTE> Dear Fellows and Staff A number of you have asked for guidance on whom to contact in College now that we have no Domestic &NAME . I am hoping to compile an indexed guide during the &NAME , but for now , perhaps the following will be of help . Most aspects of college life previously co-ordinated by the Domestic &NAME are now being run by Heads of Departments , and co-ordinated through the Heads of Departments Committee . I have listed individual members below , with job titles and contact details . If you prefer , you may contact &NAME &NAME , who is the secretary to the committee : email &EMAIL or &NAME &NUM and she will put items of business onto the next committee agenda or , if urgent , forward them to the appropriate departmental head . &NAME is the Maintenance secretary and uses the Maintenance pigeonhole in College . The Heads of &NAME &WEBSITE chair of the committee is the &NAME &NAME and he attends Council on behalf of the committee . Heads of Departments who previously reported to the Domestic &NAME now report to the &NAME and I act as a sort of go-between . I hope this is helpful - do let me know if you need any other information at this stage or if you are aware of any aspects of college life not covered by the new arrangement . &NAME &NAME &NAME , Health and Safety / Webmaster &EMAIL &NUM &NAME &NAME , &NAME &NAME &EMAIL &NAME &NUM [ CHAIR ] &NAME &NAME , &NAME Supervisor &EMAIL &NAME &NUM &NAME &NAME , Maintenance Secretary &EMAIL &NUM [ secretary ] &NAME &NAME , &NAME Catering Manager &EMAIL &NUM &NAME &NAME , Warden of &NAME &NAME &EMAIL &NAME &NUM &NAME &NAME , Catering Manager , &EMAIL &NAME &NUM &NAME Leader , &NAME Officer &EMAIL &NAME &NUM &NAME &NAME , &NAME &EMAIL &NAME &NUM &NAME &NAME , Domestic Supervisor , &EMAIL &NAME &NUM &NAME &NAME , Conference Manager &EMAIL &NAME &NUM &NAME Whiting , &NAME &NAME &EMAIL &NAME &NUM <END_QUOTE> &NAME &NAME &NAME &NAME &NAME &NAME &NAME &NAME &NAME &NAME : &NUM &NUM / &NUM &NAME : &NUM &NUM If you wish to be removed from this mailing list please send an email to &NAME Leader ( &EMAIL )
