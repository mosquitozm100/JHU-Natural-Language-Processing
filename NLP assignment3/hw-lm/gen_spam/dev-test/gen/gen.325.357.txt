SUBJECT: &NAME Mail Dear All , This information has been sent to us by the University Computing Service . Introduction of spam scanning On Thursday morning ( &NUM ) we will be installing the first stage of the email scanning system on ppsw ( the central email relay ) . This will scan messages for spam-like features , and score them accordingly , to make it easier for users to filter their email . An easy to use interface that will allow users to control the level of spam that arrives in their &NAME inbox will be introduced on &NAME next week . Note that we are not changing the central filtering rules at this stage , only adding an &NAME to messages coming into the University that will allow users to filter their own mail so that spam is delivered into a separate mailbox that may be examined at &NAME . More information , including details of how to filter your messages to remove spam from your inbox on systems other than &NAME , can be found in recent editions of the &NAME Service Newsletter : &WEBSITE As a result of this work there may be some interruptions to the flow of email during installation and final testing , but this should only result in messages being delayed , not lost or rejected . Email will not be unduly delayed when the system is in normal operation . &WEBSITE &NAME Leader , &NAME Officer Computer Office , &NAME College University of &NAME &NAME Road , &NAME &NAME &NAME : &NUM &NUM &WEBSITE Today 's the day I do nothing .
