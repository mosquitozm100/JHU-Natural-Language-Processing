SUBJECT: &NAME &NAME &NAME , at long last I seem to be making progress towards getting a publisher . It turns out for some reason Festschrifts are generally poor sellers , so one has to do it but not place the emphasis on that . Could you give me your opinion about the feasability of holding some sort of conference or meeting in &NAME on or around the relevant date - &NUM August &NUM . It might be an idea sound &NAME out about this and to check the date - I 'm working off Who 's Who , but mistakes are always possible . . ... at the same time ask him about whether there is any chance of getting &NAME &NAME to contribute a preface page - this would make the whole thing enormously more attractive to publishers . Is this OK ? I 'm also going to circulate the group about whether the book should be published prior to the date of a meeting . &NAME
