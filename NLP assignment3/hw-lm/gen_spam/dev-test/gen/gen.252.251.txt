A stag weekend at &NAME Towers ! Gone are the days when it used to be a quick drink in the pub ! ! Sounds fun , though &SMILEY I 'm around in &NAME until July 3rd . My church is hosting an outreach in the &NAME &NAME area of &NAME for a week . So I 'm pretty involved with that . The funny thing is that the main things I 'm doing is a drama every evening and leading worship on Sunday morning - but I 've completely lost my voice ! ! So I 'm trusting &NAME that I 'll find my voice by Thursday . Like I said , we 're having a barbeque on sunday night if you 'd like to come . I understand you 've got a lot of work on at the moment , but it would be really nice to see you before I leave . If you ca n't make it Sunday then let me know when you 're free . see you soon &SMILEY &CHAR ' Strangers are just friends waiting to happen .
