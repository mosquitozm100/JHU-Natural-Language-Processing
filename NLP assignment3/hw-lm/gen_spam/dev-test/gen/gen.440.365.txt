SUBJECT: Re : Trip report &NAME , Yes , I was considering the possibility of a random fluctuation , but I 'm thinking it 's more likely to be a rogue supermorphing viral infestation . I believe that it might hold the key to my very existence . What if tomorrow all my results could be perfect ? Would that not be worth pulling my hair out for ? Would that not be worth ... Yes , anyway . I 'll try to enjoy my time in &NAME , and not be distracted by thoughts of you surrounded by flocks of giggling females , being fed grapes and massaged to the sound track of ' Dirty Dancing ' . Glad to hear yesterday evening passed off without ' incident ' - wahey the &NAME ! ! See you ' pon my return . &CHAR &NAME Wed , &NUM &NAME &NUM , &NAME &NAME wrote : <QUOTE> &NAME BeF1os , &NAME you 're out of the lab and in bed . Sorry to hear of your computer misforture , sounds like a case of a microsoft product functioning correct &NAME . Maybe its an intrinsic anomaly in the &NAME &NAME building which causes random fluctuations in the programme modules which , due to the inevitabil ity of choice and human emotion , result in your inevitable doom , &NAME . &NAME , a bit of random matrix-isation there . Yes , so the cinema . Well &NAME came along , which I guess made the walk home less awkward , but not having an armrest on either side does leave one a &CHAR it restless . Also , the sticky floor ( goodness know what those sweaty teenage rs do ) spoiled my enjoyment too . Anyway , we came back and watched a programm &CHAR on TV advertising in politics and she drank herbal tea , I drank hot milk with amaretto and lad talked to her about actresses from &NAME flicks and whether or not they were Niobi or not . Oh the joys . Anyway , I 'm having a girlie evening tomorrow night , &NUM or &NUM &NAME chiccies for chocolate based cuisine and probably a dreadful movie . All in the name of hareemdom . &NAME . Oh &NAME , its a strange game is n't it . Anyway , have a great trip up to &NAME and a relaxing bath .
