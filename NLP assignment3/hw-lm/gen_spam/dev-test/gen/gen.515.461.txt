SUBJECT: Re : submission for &NAME &NAME on &NAME & its applic . to &NAME & Summ . Hi &NAME , I sent another email previous to this one but not sure if it got through ! if so ignore this email ! ! I had time to look over the article over the weekend and found a few corrections : * Section &NUM - Figure &NUM not yet included ( probably know already : ) ) * section &NUM - table numbering wrong in paragraph &NUM and &NUM - typo - ( &NAME ) vs ( &NAME ) - paragraph &NUM should end something like ' ... number of unanswered questions by about &NUM in training ( &NAME &SMILEY data . ' I 'm not sure what you require in order to get the results for your &NAME algorithm on the &NAME &NUM &NAME contexts ( section &NUM ) . If you need result ( submission ) files then let me know which &NUM and I can get them for you asap ! otherwise if you need to alter my code you can access my unix account using : user name : &NAME passwd : &NUMI made a back up of my &NAME directory in my home directory - in a directory called ' &NAME ' ! ! : The &NAME file lets you know which files are which - the &WEBSITE c++ file - the options for which are in an appendix in my writeup . To compile after changing the &WEBSITE file ( just a script file ) to &WEBSITE are example scripts that take a question number as input ( the position of the question 's &NAME structure in the compiled &NAME file - numbering starts from &NUM ) I will be leaving tomorrow and it will take me a few days ( ! ) to get back over that side of the world ! but if you have any questions I 'll check my email tonight and when I get back too ! I 'm not sure how much time I 'll be able to spend on coding if you need me to interface with your code given this paper is due during exam time ! But I can probably come in and spend a morning in the labs with you if you need me to . I hope that helps : ) &NAME : ) On &NAME &NUM &NUM , &NAME &NAME wrote : <QUOTE> &NAME , I enclose a pdf attachment which is our submission ( so far ) . I am afraid it is missing the critical results as I 've been defeated by &NUM co-author locking her files and setting off early for &NAME ! Your submission deadline falls in the middle of &NAME , but we would very much like to include the results if possible before the submission is refereed . To do so we would need a &NUM week extension of your deadline until 24th April . If this is not possible , please review it as is . thanks , &NAME <END_QUOTE>
