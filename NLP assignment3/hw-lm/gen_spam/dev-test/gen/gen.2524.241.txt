The Council 's opening statement at the Discussion on Intellectual Prope rty Rights contained the following : &NAME Council wish to put on the record that their intention is not to a ssert ownership of copyright in lecture notes or books except where explicitly agreed as part of a commissioning process , for example as might occur for the creation of material for e-learning.94 The Head of Department interpreted this to mean that the authors of mater ial which is explicitly commissioned would have to agree to the commissioning and the transfer of copyright . As far as he was aware , no such commissioned material for teaching under the Syndicate 's jurisdiction had been produ ced . It was his belief that if the Syndicate felt that there was a case for material to be commissioned , for example for an e-learning course , then he would consult the Department before proceeding . He suggested that ' license to use ' rather than copyright transfer would then be a more appropriate approach . Following further discussion , Professor &NAME reiterated that the position was clear : copyright remained firmly in the hands of the author . &NUM Calculators for use in &NAME The currently approved calculator had been discontinued and its replacement had features that were a cause of concern to the Board of Examinations . The Teaching Committee had considered the matter and the Syndicate accepted their recommendation that they would accept any calculator that satisfies the various Natural Science and Engineering committees . &NUM Membership of the Degree Committee Dr &NAME 's impending promotion to Professor entitled him to serve ex officio on the Degree Committee thus creating a vacancy for &CHAR co-opted member .
