SUBJECT: Re : &NAME swap ? &NAME , We are currently planning to stay here in &NAME for the &NUM academic year . I guess we are n't exactly in the market for a house swap since we probably would n't want to subject the kids to yet another school switch but on the other hand , we might be amenable to having house-sitters . I 'll take up the issue directly with your sister . &NAME &NAME and &NAME : Do you know your rough dates for coming to the states yet ? What kind of arrangement are you hoping for ? &NAME <QUOTE> <QUOTE> &NAME &NAME , &NAME is planning on taking a sabbatical to &NAME next &NAME for &NUM months . Since it is desirable for her kids to go to &NAME &NAME , I thought I would put you &NUM in touch to see if you could arrange a house swap . <END_QUOTE> <END_QUOTE>
