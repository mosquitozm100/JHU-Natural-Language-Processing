SUBJECT: [ &NAME ] Corpus Linguistics &NUM call for participation CORPUS LINGUISTICS &NUM &NAME University ( UK ) , &NUM - &NUM March &NUM CALL FOR PARTICIPANTS Corpus Linguistics &NUM will be a forum for all concerned with the computer-assisted empirical analysis of natural language . Our definition of ' corpus ' is broad , and we therefore welcome those working on substantial literary texts or other kinds of text collection as well as more ' traditional ' corpus &NAME . Similarly , we wish to encourage further cross-fertilization between work occurring in language engineering ( e.g. information extraction , parsing ) and linguistics . We believe that corpus &NAME should be aware of the latest developments in language processing . We also believe that language engineers should be aware of the findings and needs of corpus &NAME . The conference will include invited talks from : &NAME &NAME - Corpora and the lexicon &NAME &NAME - topic &NAME &NAME &NAME - &NAME , phrase , or function : a comparison between frame semantics and local grammars &NAME &NAME - Everything you wanted to know about the American National Corpus ... but were afraid to ask There will be &NUM pre-conference workshops : Corpus-Based Approaches to Figurative Language Learner Corpora : Design , Development and &NAME &NAME Corpora : Linguistic Requirements and Technical Perspectives Shallow Processing of Large Corpora ( &NAME &NUM ) Details of the workshops , and the more than &NUM accepted papers and posters are available on the conference website : &WEBSITE The aims of Corpus Linguistics &NUM are : &NUM to encourage dialogue between those working on similar issues in different languages and between areas with a ( perhaps as yet untapped ) potential to interact . &NUM to encourage dialogue between researchers using corpora in linguistics and those using corpora in language engineering .
