SUBJECT: Access to &NAME Court over Christmas Vacation Dear All The &NAME &NAME &NAME door entry system is playing up at present so we have decided not to risk relying on it over Christmas . We will therefore be switching off the &NAME locks on the afternoon of 23rd December and your blue keys will not allow access . If you need access to &NAME Court between 23rd December and 3rd January you will need to collect a metal key from the &NAME &NAME Lodge . Please collect your key by lunchtime on the 23rd at the latest . Christmas Residents are advised to collect keys in good time and to test them in both front and back door locks before the lodge closes for Christmas . I will be coming to College for 11am tomorrow ( Thursday ) and can bring keys for anyone in College . Please email me by 10.30am and I will deliver them at lunchtime . Best wishes &NAME &NAME &NAME &NAME &NAME &NAME &NAME &NAME &NAME &NAME &NAME : &NUM &NUM / &NUM &NAME : &NUM &NUM If you wish to be removed from this mailing list please send an email to &NAME Leader ( &EMAIL )
