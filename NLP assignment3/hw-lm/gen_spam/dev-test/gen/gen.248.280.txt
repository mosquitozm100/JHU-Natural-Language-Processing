SUBJECT: Re : Project workplan Hi , The workplan spec quotes resources of the order of 850MHz processor , 500MByte &NAME , &NUM &NAME disc space , 500MByte scratch disc . I figured out I would go ahead with the ' C181 MERGERS / ACQUISITIONS ' topic code but did n't know where to find the relevant files in the huge corpus as the files had &WEBSITE ' ( these did contain some code info ) . I am a bit lost about which zipped file ( &CHAR ) would be relevant to my topic-code . However &NAME &NAME &NAME 's report of last year I figured out that he stored each such zipped file in the local scratch and further worked with Each days unzipped &NAME files . So I guess a further &NAME of scratch disk space would suffice i.e. total of abt &NAME . Please let me know if I am on the right lines . Many Thanks , &NAME &NAME <QUOTE> From : &NAME &NAME ( &EMAIL ) To : ' &NAME &NAME ' ( &EMAIL ) Subject : Re : &NAME workplan Date : &NAME , &NUM Mar &NUM &NUM : &NUM : &NUM &NUM &WEBSITE -- look at the workplan spec and note statements about standard alloc of filespace .
