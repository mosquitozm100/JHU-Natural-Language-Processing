SUBJECT: Re : &NAME special issue ? Hi &NAME , sorry I totally dropped the ball on this email ! I 'm finally just doing my grading for the semester and am cleaning up my mailbox and found this . &NAME , I 'm swamped right now . but I think it 's a great idea , I 'd love to have an issue on semantic parsing or &NAME interpretation or something . I 'll start the process of talking to some of the other folks that are working on this and see if they think an issue would be interesting . - &NAME &NAME Wed , &NAME &NUM , &NUM at &NUM : &NAME , &NAME &NAME wrote : <QUOTE> &NAME , As a member of the ed. board of &NAME Sp & &NAME , I wonder if I can interest you in being editor of a special issue ? &NAME &NAME and I are actively encouraging submission of articles in stat . &NAME and I 've arranged for a special issue on &NAME ( edited by &NAME &NAME and &NAME &NAME ) which shld appear 2nd quarter &NUM , hopefully capitalising on the output of Senseval-3 . However , we wld like to have at least &NUM more , also signalling a shift of emphasis away from the signal processing / lg modelling areas . I do n't have a strong feeling for what I want the issue to cover , but e.g. something in the statistical parsing area would be very appropriate . The timescale wld probably be 4th quarter &NUM , so we 'd want final versions of all papers by Sept04 suggesting first submission deadline of around end of Jan04 for comfort . Would you be prepared to edit such an issue ? -- this involves writing a ~500 word call for papers that wld both appear in the jnl and be sent to relevant lists , arranging and participating in the refereeing process , and writing a short intro to the issue . You cld either do this alone or enlist another colleague ( e.g. &NAME &NAME ? ) . It wld also be fine to submit a paper yourself ( see the recent special issue on generation ) -- in this case we wld arrange independent refereeing . You cld count on my support throughout this process , both in terms of liaising with &NAME and assisting with the refereeing , as I am sure wld the other relevantly qualified members of the editorial board ( &NAME &NAME , &NAME &NAME , &NAME &NAME &NAME , &NAME &NAME ... ) . &NAME handle the paper submission , formatting and copy editing side of the process . all the best , &NAME &NAME &NAME in Computational Linguistics &ORG University of &NAME &NAME &NAME Ave &NAME &NAME &NAME , &NAME Email : &EMAIL Web page : &WEBSITE &NAME : &NUM &NUM &NAME : &NUM &NUM <END_QUOTE> &NAME &NAME ( &EMAIL Dept of Linguistics , Dept of Computer Science , Institute of Cognitive Science University of &NAME at Boulder PHONE : ( &NUM ) &NUM Boulder , &NAME &NUM &NAME : ( &NUM ) &NUM
