SUBJECT: Re : Special issue &NAME / &NAME Merging the status reports from &NAME and &NAME , I get the summary list below . From this I conclude that &CHAR ) &NUM - ) enough material for a single issue ready by deadline of 1st week of &NAME ( ie papers in cat &NUM and &NUM below ) &CHAR ) &NUM - ) enough material for a double issue ready by deadline of 1st week of &NAME &CHAR ) &NUM - ) enough material for a single issue ready by 1st week of &NAME ( ie papers in cat &NUM and &NUM below ) + a second single issue ready by 1st week of April . ( ie papers in cat &NUM and &NUM below ) Do you agree with this assesment ? If so it looks like we should consider a special issue published in &NUM parts , the first in April &NUM and the second in July &NUM . The risk with this is that we need to have high confidence that the papers in sections &NUM and &NUM will come back in time , and be accepted . &NAME &NUM &NAME and ready to send to &NAME &NAME / &NUM ( &NAME ) &NAME / &NUM ( &NAME ) &NAME / &NUM : ( &NAME ) &NUM &NAME but awaiting final minor revisions &NAME / &NUM : ( &NAME ) &NAME / &NUM : ( &NAME ) &NAME / &NUM : ( &NAME ) &NUM Revised version under second review &NAME / &NUM : ( &CHAR &NAME , &CHAR &NAME , &CHAR &NAME , &CHAR &NAME ) &NAME / &NUM : ( &NAME ) &NUM Waiting for Revised Paper &NAME / &NUM : ( &NAME &NAME ) &NAME / &NUM : ( &NAME ) &NAME / &NUM : ( &CHAR &NAME , &CHAR Pal , &CHAR &CHAR &NAME ) &NAME / &NUM : ( &NUM &NAME ) &NUM Rejected &NAME / &NUM : ( &NAME ) &NAME / &NUM : ( &NAME ) &NAME / &NUM : ( &NAME ) &NAME / &NUM : ( &CHAR Chang , &CHAR &NAME , &CHAR &NAME )
