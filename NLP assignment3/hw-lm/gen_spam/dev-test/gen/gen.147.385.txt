SUBJECT: Re : biologically inspired robots Yes , we 've evolved a DeathBot here in the Robot Lab . I used the fitness function - Minimise the number of deaths in the next &NUM years . The lifetime of the &NAME is &NUM days , it can kill as many people as it likes within those &NUM days to achieve this end . Unfortunately it came across a local minima whereby it killed everyone within the first &NUM days ( &NAME evolution ... ) . After a tweaking of this fitness function with reward in proportion to the ' &NUM / ( &NUM + ( means deaths * ends deaths ) ) ' it fails to find a solution . Any suggestions how to encode the minimum number of people it should kill in &NUM days to reduce the total in the next &NUM years ? &NAME
