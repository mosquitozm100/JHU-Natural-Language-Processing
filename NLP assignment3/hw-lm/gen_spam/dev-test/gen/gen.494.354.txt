SUBJECT: Correction in subject line : * Workshop * announcement Dear all , In my previous mail to the amlap list about the workshop at &NAME University I accidentally put the subject title as ' &NAME announcement ' . It should have been ' Workshop announcement ' . Apologies for possibly causing confusion about the nature and / or source of the message . Thanks , &NAME &NAME &NAME : &NUM ( &NUM ) &NUM &NUM Computational Linguistics , &NAME &NAME &NAME , &NAME &NUM &NUM &NUM &NUM D-66041 &NAME , &NAME &WEBSITE &CHAR Dear all , &NAME University is holding a &NUM day workshop to discuss the recent advances and future direction for research in computational models of human sentence processing : Those working in the field who are interested in attending the workshop should contact &NAME &NAME for further details ( &EMAIL ) and confirmation , as space is strictly limited . &NAME : Computational models of sentence processing Dates : &NUM July , &NUM &NAME : &NAME &NUM ( minus &NUM ) &NAME , &NAME University &NAME , &NAME Further details are available from the workshop website : &WEBSITE The workshop is organized by &ORG , the Department of Computationa &CHAR Linguistics and Phonetics , and the &ORG ( &NAME ) , &NAME ; and is part of the &NAME &NUM ( Resource Adaptive Cognitive Systems ) . Workshop themes The workshop is intended to address what we view as &NUM central issues for the development of computational models of human language processing . We feel these issues represent the current stumbling blocks to constructing the next generation of models , and our aim is to hear concrete views on how to tackle these problems now and where research efforts should be directed in the medium term . &NUM Models of working memory in language processing : to what extent does human working memory influence language processing behaviour , are the mechanisms for language processing adapted to take memory constraints into account ? More generally , how should theories of sentence processing be situated within , and reconciled with , more general accounts of cognitive processing and cognitive limitations ? &NUM . Broad coverage : how can we develop psycholinguistic models that scale up in such a way that explains both high performance in general as well as the more pathological behaviours focused upon in psycholinguistic research ? What kinds of mechanisms ( statistical , constraint-based , ... ) and linguistic theories ( dependency , generative , incremental ) seem most promising for developing broad coverage models ? &NUM . Semantics in performance : how can we extend current syntactically-based accounts with implementable approximations of human semantic knowledge ( lexical , sentential , as well as plausibility ) ?
