SUBJECT: Re : hey Hey &CHAR , <QUOTE> Did you wait till the credits had rolled at the end to see the trailor for the 3rd - looks very good ! <END_QUOTE> &NAME NO ! ! I did n't know . <QUOTE> Have you now finished at &NAME ? <END_QUOTE> No , I 've got a month left to finish off my masters thesis . It 's on spam email filtering ! <QUOTE> Most importantly what are you doing next ? <END_QUOTE> Well , I 'm interested in doing a PhD actually , but I want to take next year off from studying to do some more non-intellectual things . I 'm thinking of going to &NAME to work with &NAME for a few months toward the end of the year . I think I might go back home for the start of the year and try to get a job . <QUOTE> are you still playing footie ? <END_QUOTE> I played for my college first team this season , alongside some pretty good players - &NUM guy played in the &NAME youth team for a few years , another played at the &NAME &NAME youth team , and another played semi-pro before coming to &NAME . Even though we were theoretically a good team , the spirit was actually not that great , and we ended up coming 3rd or 4th ( I 'm not sure which ! ) in our division , which was admittedly the top out of &NUM divisions . Anyway , I 've had some trouble with my ankle recently which has been a real pain . I really need a new one - guess I 'll have to wait until I get to heaven . &NAME to hear about your placement in &NAME ; I 've heard it 's one of the most beautiful places in the world - should be seriously nice . <QUOTE> Are you doing anything interesting over the &NAME ? <END_QUOTE> I 'm going on about &NUM holidays ! Nowhere very exotic , but I 'll see lots of friends and family which will be great . &NAME , I 'm getting back to work ... Take it easy &NAME , &SMILEY &CHAR
