SUBJECT: Re : Hierarchical Corpus ; &NAME : character sets , &NAME &NUM <QUOTE> &NUM &NAME - &NAME Collection Version &NUM . Is it 's hierarchy deep enough to make a point when it comes to showing the dependency of classification results on the hierarchical structure of the corpus ? <END_QUOTE> I can send you the &NAME / &NAME / &NAME / &NAME draft paper on &NAME if you do n't have that already . Let me ( not list ) know . The &NAME hierarchy is relatively shallow , but there are some quite narrow categories as well as broad &NUM . Also , the hierarchy is well understood compared to some of the others . So I think it 's quite reasonable for experiments on hierarchical categorization . &NAME &NAME &NUM : A reminder when posting messages to DDLBETA to try and use pure &NAME . &NAME &NUM : The Third Workshop on Operational Text Classification will be held at &NAME &NUM , on August &NUM , &NUM . Details and &NAME will be at &WEBSITE
