SUBJECT: Starting my Project &NAME &NAME , If you do n't mind I have a few questions in regards to starting my &NAME project . Firstly I have assumed as I have n't heard any differently that I am being permitted to continue with the course even though my overall grade was C+ ( although will have to raise this to a B- to pass the course ) . Am I able to start my project before the start of the second year ? I know that I would like to do a project in a speech rather than a language area ( as this relates to my current job ) . My employers have some ideas on the kind of areas they would like me to work on but I am not sure what the process is of making this official or finding someone to supervise me . Should I submit a proposal to you and then a supervisor would be assigned or should I go through another route ? The preliminary discussions I have had about my project with my employers all relate to areas that would have a direct commercial use i.e using existing recognisers ( in our case it would most likely be Nuance&SMILEY and working on how to optimise their use in various situations . Is a project along these lines acceptable ? Thank you for your time , &NAME
