SUBJECT: &NAME &NAME 's thesis apparently &NAME &NAME emailed &NAME asking for her thesis and she responded saying that she 'd photocopied it for &NUM &NAME students and was n't going to do it again ' . photocopy ' - do n't know what era we 're in here . Anyway , while I 'm not so concerned about whether &NAME gets it , I think &NAME probably needs to have seen it . You do n't happen to have seen a copy in &NAME , do you ? &NAME says he had a pre-viva version but that he seems to have lost it , and it does n't seem like such a smart idea to ask &NAME . Any ideas ? I 'll email her myself , but otherwise I suppose it 's interlibrary loan or something seriously time-consuming . &NAME
