SUBJECT: Re : &NAME accommodation Hi &NAME , My course concludes at the end of July , so I would like to have my room until then ( &NUM &NAME Road , Room &NUM ) . Many regards , &NAME On &NAME , &NUM &NAME &NUM , &NAME &NAME wrote : <QUOTE> TO ALL POSTGRADUATES Could you please let me know your plans during the summer to enable &NAME in Accounts to issue the long summer vac bills ? Some of you have contacted me already , but if I do not hear from you &NAME will automatically bill you up to &NUM Sept and adjust your account accordingly if you leave before then . For those who have entered the ballot and will be changing accommodation , I will be in touch individually as soon as your new accommodation is available ( after &NUM June ) and again your bill will be adjusted according to the date you actually move . If anyone is planning to take a degree on &NUM July , please contact me as soon as possible , so that I have your name provisionally ( I also deal with degree ceremonies as well as accommodation ! ) . Regards , &NAME <END_QUOTE>
