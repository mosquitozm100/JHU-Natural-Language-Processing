If you , for instance , load corpus files from the first &NAME corpora &NAME ( not the &NUM version ) and choose e.g. the whole &NAME folder , you automatically load each file twice ( &WEBSITE ' to ' &WEBSITE ' . This last file includes all the other files , so you can simply load this &NUM file if you do not need to know which of the A-R texts the examples in your &NAME concorda nce come from .
