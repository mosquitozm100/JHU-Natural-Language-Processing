SUBJECT: [ &NAME ] &NAME release of &NAME : : &NAME We are pleased to announce the &NAME release of the WordNet : : Similarity package . This is a significant upgrade to our previous Distance packages . You can find &NAME : : &NAME ( including &NAME ) at : &WEBSITE This package consists of &NAME modules along with supporting &NAME programs that implement the semantic similarity measures of &NAME ( &NUM ) , &NAME ( &NUM ) , &NAME ( &NUM ) , &NAME ( &NUM ) , &NAME &NAME ( &NAME and &NAME ( &NUM ) . The package contains &NAME modules designed as object classes with methods that take as input &NUM word senses from WordNet . These methods can be embedded in any &NAME program and will return the semantic similarity between the senses according to the requested measure . There are also support programs for generating information content values ( &NAME &NUM ) for WordNet concepts from a variety of corpora , including the &NAME , &NAME &NAME , &NAME , or any raw text provided by a user . The information content values are required by the measures of &NAME , &NAME , and &NAME , and could also be useful in a wide range of WordNet based applications . The package also provides a simple command line interface that returns the similarity measure of &NUM given words . This is very similar to our earlier version of the Distance package . A number of switches and options have been provided to enhance the output with trace data and other information . Please download and give Similarity a try ! We anxiously await your feedback and suggestions .
