The Conference builds upon the tradition of the successful series of NASA / &NAME Workshops on &NAME &NAME ( the first Workshop hosted by &NAME in &NAME , &NUM ; the second Workshop hosted by NASA &NAME in &NAME &NAME , &NUM ; the third hosted by &NAME in &NAME Beach in &NUM ; and the fourth hosted by NASA &NAME in &NAME &NAME ) . &NAME &NAME is an emerging field that applies evolution to automate design and adaptation of physical reconfigurable and morphable structures such as electronic systems , antennas , &NAME and robots . The purpose of this conference is to bring together leading researchers from the evolvable hardware community , representatives of the automated design and programmable / reconfigurable hardware communities , technology developers and end-users from the aerospace , military and commercial sectors . &NAME hardware techniques enable self-reconfigurability , adaptability and learning by programmable devices and thus have the potential to significantly increase the functionality of deployable hardware systems . &NAME &NAME is expected to have major impact on deployable systems for space systems and defense applications that need to survive and perform at optimal functionality during long duration in unknown , harsh and / or changing environments . It is also expected to greatly enhance the capability of systems that need modification , upgrade and learning without interrupting their operation . The focus of this year 's conference will be evolvable hardware for reliability . Reliability issues range from fault-recovery and survivable NASA / DoD systems operating in extreme environments to intelligent adaptive and learning systems for protection of areas and security of communications . Topics to be covered include , but are not limited to : Evolutionary hardware design Co-evolution of hybrid systems , such as wetware , chemical , mechanical , and electronic components , etc. Intrinsic / on-line and extrinsic / off-line evolution Hardware / software co-evolution Self-repairing , reconfiguring , and fault tolerant hardware &NAME hardware Novel devices , testbeds and tools supporting evolvable hardware &NAME computing and adaptive hardware Real-world applications of evolvable hardware , such as : - &NAME and watermarking of digital data - Radiation hardening - &NAME - &NAME and identification of biological agents and extraterrestrial lifeforms ( astrobiology ) - Ultra-safe systems SUBMISSION OF PAPERS Prospective authors are invited to submit their work by email in &NAME , &NAME , or &NAME formats to &EMAIL . The paper is limited to &NUM pages and should be submitted in single-spaced , &NUM point type on a &NUM ' &CHAR &NUM ' or equivalent paper with &NUM ' margins on all sides . Each submission should contain the following items : ( &NUM ) title of paper , ( &NUM ) author name ( &CHAR ) , ( &NUM ) first author physical address , ( &NUM ) first author e-mail address , ( &NUM ) first author phone number , ( &NUM ) a maximum &NUM words abstract . Accepted papers will be published in the Conference proceedings . The conference will maintain its single-track forma and will include posters sessions and panel discussions . Each research group is invited to prepare a poster describing their research . A one-page abstract of the poster should be submitted following the same procedures as the paper .
