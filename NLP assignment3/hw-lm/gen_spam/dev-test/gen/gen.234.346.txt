SUBJECT: Re : &NAME spec issues update &NAME This all looks excellent . Thanks for getting the ball rolling . Getting &NAME and &NAME to do one on &NAME 's would be especially good since ( &CHAR ) its a hot topic in both speech and language , and ( &CHAR ) getting their names on the journal as guest editors would add further credibility to &NAME as a journal that &NAME folks should read . &NAME <QUOTE> &NAME &NAME and &NAME &NAME have agreed to do one on &NAME . There is a Senseval competition next summer they are both helping to organise next summer , so the plan is to draw many papers from participants but leave it open to others . They are preparing a call for us to vet and pass on to &NAME &NAME &NAME ( and possibly &NAME &NAME ) want to do one on structured language models for &NAME , &NAME etc -- &NAME suggested this as he was worried that not enough good material would be forthcoming for one on unsupervised grammar induction . Further down the road , there is the possibility of one on stochastic &NAME , based on a workshop / conference due to happen next spring I think , but the organisers are still thinking about it . With luck the &NAME &NUM wld be ready for 2nd quarter &NUM &NAME <END_QUOTE>
