When I asked what is was , she explained that she loved to needlepoint and whenever she went away -- to a resort or on a cruise -- the lighting was so bad she rigged up her own portable light . It was a crude flourescent light taped into a make-do socket and cord . She was right , the lighting in hotel rooms and cabins leaves much to be desired . Even when I sit at a desk in hotel rooms to write something down , read over notes or input information into a computer , the desk task lights are generally so low wattage that it is hard to read , yet alone do paper work . Some travelers may resort to bringing a larger wattage light bulb along . If working on the road is important to you , the Cadillac of portable lighting is available . Environmental Lighting Concepts has come up with Ott-Lite Technology , a portable vision saver light lamp . Developed by Dr. &NAME &NAME &NAME , a light researcher , &NAME 's full light spectrum technology , which is endorsed by low vision clinics , replicates natural daylight so it reduces glare and eye strain . &CHAR &NUM watt bulb provides enough light to replace up to a 75-watt incandescent bulb . When I sat down at a desk and turned on the Ott-Lite lamp , it flooded my workspace with a crisp white light that made the smallest letters look sharp and colors unbelievably bright . The same workspace illuminated by a standard light bulb was yellow and muddled looking . Had I not tried this experiment , I would have not believed the difference . The lamp has a small footprint , a roundish 5-inch diameter , that allows it to fight in the smallest spaces . Its energy- efficient 13-watts of power allows it to operate cool , radiating almost no heat . The portable Ott-Lite lamp 's downside is its weight , about &NUM pounds . The weight should have no impact on road warriors who travel by car . They should count it as one of their essential pieces of equipment . However , lugging around an extra &NUM pounds in my carry- on bag does n't have much of an appeal for me . Ott-Lite products are sold at department stores and specialty retailers nationwide . In addition to the portable lamp , there is a full line of styles for the home and office . &NUM / &NUM &WEBSITE 3D)) ( ( 3D3D ) ) &CHAR &NAME &NAME &NAME -- Purchase Tickets by Sep. &NUM -- &CHAR &NAME introduces fares to &NAME from $ &NUM each way .

Check itinerary and ship plans online at &WEBSITE &NAME &NAME -- The following story making the email rounds bears the hallmark of an urban legend but contains elements of fact . It tells of 19-year-old &NAME driving from &NAME , Va . to visit a friend in &NAME at &NUM p.m. She was driving just over &NUM mph when an unmarked police car pulled up behind her and put his lights on . &NAME 's parents have always warned her to never pull over for an unmarked car on the side of the road , but rather wait until you get to a public place such as a gas station . &NAME listened to her parents advice and called # &NUM on her cell phone to tell the dispatcher that she would not pull over right away and told the dispatcher that there was an unmarked police car behind her . The dispatcher checked to confirm if there was an unmarked police car where she was . There was n't and she was told to keep driving , remain calm and that the police were on the way . &NUM minutes later , &NUM police cars surrounded her and the unmarked car behind her . They pulled the guy from the car and tackled him to the ground . The man was a convicted rapist and wanted for other crimes . Several news organizations were unable to confirm this exact incident really happened . There are news reports from around the &NAME detailing similar crimes and attempted crimes &NUM including rape &NUM perpetrated by drivers impersonating police officers in unmarked cars . Some police departments do , therefore , recommend using caution if you 're pulled over by an unmarked vehicle in a secluded area after dark . Communicate your intention to stop by slowing down and turning on emergency flashers or a turn signal . The police suggest you drive to the nearest well-lit , populated area before stopping . If you 're still suspicious , keep your doors locked and only partially roll down your window when the officer approaches . Ask to see a badge and photo I.D. Using your cell phone to contact a police dispatcher ( as advised in the email ) is an option . Be aware that the 'dial # &NUM ' option does not work in every state . If you are n't sure , dial &NUM instead . Contact your local / state police or the American Automobile Association for specific information about emergency cell phone numbers in your area .
