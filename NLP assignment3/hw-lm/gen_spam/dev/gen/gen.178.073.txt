SUBJECT: &NAME ! Dear &NAME , &NAME , I have just received your email . I sent the &NAME paper at the last minute ( when I heard the deadline got extended ) . I thought writing it would help me focus and I certainly did not expect it to be accepted as a poster . I will not present the poster if you think it is a bad idea . I am sorry that I did not discuss my progress with you earlier . I would be very grateful if we could meet up . I have started implementing a system that takes in parsed text and identifies edus according to the guidelines . I have also read &NAME 's book and his papers describing the semantics of discourse relations . I have a modified version of the edu report with the discourse relations and their semantics included in it . I would particularly like to focus on the attribution verbs . The modified definition of parenthetical units is also not precise enough . Thanks , &NAME
