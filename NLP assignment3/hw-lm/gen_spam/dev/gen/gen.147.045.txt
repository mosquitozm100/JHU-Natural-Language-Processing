SUBJECT: &NAME We are going to be very short-staffed in Reception over the summer . We are loosing &NAME &NAME to another job in June , and &NAME &NAME goes on maternity leave at about the same time . This is good for them but makes life difficult for us ! It means that &NAME &NAME will be on her own until we can recruit a replacement for &NAME . &NAME works part-time so it is inevitable that Reception will be closed for considerable periods , probably most of the afternoons and all day on Fridays . Even before &NAME and &NAME leave , there will be days when staff holidays cause short-term difficulties , so from today &NAME may be closed from time to time . I very much regret the lack of service and seek your forbearance during a difficult time . Many thanks &NAME
