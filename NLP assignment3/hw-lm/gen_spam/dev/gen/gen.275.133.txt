SUBJECT: Re : &NAME overhead projectors <QUOTE> I am at a loss to understand the recent allegations that there is a shortage of projectors in the lecture theatres . <END_QUOTE> OK , one of these were me . The first time the projector had been moved from the projector stand ( why ? ) and placed in the cupboard underneath . Now I know this I can look there , but at the time I just struggled on with one . The second time , some kind soul had removed one into the preparation room ! Again , it 's simple when one knows all the places they might have been hidden , but at the time it 's easy to believe the ' &NUM has been playing up and has been removed ' thought . <QUOTE> I checked this morning and there are : - In &NAME , &NUM projectors , the correct number - In &NAME , &NUM projectors , &NUM more than should be there . <END_QUOTE> It was n't me who borrowed one , but I can understand the ' I 'm about to lecture and need a second projector but one has disappeared crisis ' . As a meta-comment to the current issue , I suspect the &NAME projectors get moved because someone using the &NAME projectors finds they get in the way . A really nice long-term solution is to arrange that the &NUM desks ( on which the projectors sit ) just have a camera ( above or below ) so that images , written in real-time , can be projected onto the &NUM &NAME projectors ... &NAME
