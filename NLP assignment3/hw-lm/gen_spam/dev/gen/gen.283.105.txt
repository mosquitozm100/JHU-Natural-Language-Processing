SUBJECT: &NAME &NAME The educational psychologist 's report recommends that &NAME be allowed to submit his essay &NUM weeks after the exams , but I do n't want him trying to do that at the same time as the project . What do you think about giving him time after the end of the course for the essay ? The degree committee meeting is currently set for September &NUM - as long as we have it marked by then , I do n't see any structural problem . We could ask him to submit by , e.g. , August 29th - &NAME says she can &NAME it . I strongly suspect we 'll need to give him extra time for the project too - since this is n't mentioned in the report , I probably ought to discuss it with the college and perhaps ask the psychologist for recommendations . The college and Board of examinations have agreed a procedure for him taking the exams over &NUM days . The report recommends that he should not be penalised in the exam for spelling and / or grammar mistakes . I do n't imagine that any of us would be inclined to do this anyway , but I will ask &NAME to put a note in with the scripts etc. I have a copy of a fax of the report - we 'll get a proper copy tomorrow or Friday in the post . He has a number of identifiable problems , most seriously that he has impaired auditory working memory ' - this is leading to comprehension problems . I will attempt to take account of this when supervising his project . &NAME
