We are staying in a Travel &NAME just outside &NAME ( near &NAME Park ) . We will meet on the Friday night and go to the pub that is attached to the hotel ( an important factor I thought when booking ! ! ) . We will then get up early enough to make a good day out at &NAME Towers ( which is only &NUM miles away ) . We will leave the theme park at about 6pm when it shuts and then go out for a meal and a few drinks in &NAME . Then I will hopefully be able to book a football pitch ( probably not &NAME Park ) for the Sunday to have a kick about and then we can all go home in the afternoon ! Sound good ? Looking forward to seeing you mate , &CHAR &CHAR soon ! &NAME Hotmail messages direct to your mobile phone &WEBSITE <END_QUOTE>
