SUBJECT: Re : [ &NAME ] Survey : interactive websites for teaching Hi &NAME , there is a useful list of CL-demos compiled by &NAME &NAME : &WEBSITE A neat demonstration and visualization of clustering words and word senses was developed within the &NAME project , &NAME : &WEBSITE I used this page with my students and they liked it a lot . Cheers , Spela &NAME &NAME wrote : <QUOTE> Dear all , Interactive websites for teaching &NAME and corpus linguistics Do you know of any neat websites that could be used to demo and teach about &NAME and corpus linguistics ? I am surveying what is available , either produced for teaching or which ( like some product demos ) could play a useful role in teaching . My goals are both for input to our MSc ( &NAME &NAME and &NAME ) and as a small research project into the web and pedagogy ( with ref to &NAME / corpus linguistics ) . Feedback from students and teachers about how well the sites supported student learning are of particular interest . Items of most interest are those that do not have access restrictions , do not involve installing anything and will make sense to decent linguistics majors ( eg not too specialist ) Examples / items already on my list include : &NAME Research &NAME &NAME 's parser , dependency database , corpus-based word clusters etc &WEBSITE &NAME &NAME and &NAME &NAME 's OpenMind page for doing manual &NAME &WEBSITE &NAME : &WEBSITE Web research &NAME labs - sets function ( also now-almost-standard search engine functions like translation , access to online dictionaries , view-as-html , similar-pages ) citeseer &NAME commercial &NAME tagger and parser Corpus query &NAME online &NAME &NAME 's Multext-east bilingual concordancing &NAME &NAME 's corpus lingustics ( in Spanish ) &WEBSITE Other - computer science &NAME learning : &WEBSITE Do n't quite meet the criteria as they 're not very interactive but worth including nonetheless- Corpora 's own archive , plus indexes into it from &WEBSITE &NAME If I get much interest , I 'll post a summary . Thanks very much , &NAME &NAME <END_QUOTE>
