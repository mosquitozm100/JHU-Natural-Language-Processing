SUBJECT: results ! Hi &NAME , I have got some results . I wrote them up and sent them to ranlp03 . The paper &WEBSITE , please have a look if you have time . I tried to address some of the criticism I received from eacl such as : Having results by including some , &NAME bias by mentioning that I was aware of other works in discourse segmentation ( &NAME for example ) and justifying that for the purpose of comparison with &NAME then &NAME bias is inevitable . I also mentioned that I was aware of the need for more than &NUM judges ( which is what I had for this ) . I am still working on it though . Thank you , &NAME
