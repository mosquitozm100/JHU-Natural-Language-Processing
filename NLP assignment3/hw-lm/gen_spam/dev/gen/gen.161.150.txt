Place cells are cells that respond to the environment the animal is in. In this paper we present a model of place cells based on &NAME Organising Maps . The aim of this paper is to show that localisation can be performed even without having a built in map . The model presented shows that the landmarks are selected without any human interference . After training , a robot can localise itself within a learnt environment . &NAME &NAME ) ) &NAME and Adaptive Systems Group ( ( ) ) &NAME , &NAME of &NAME , &NAME &NAME &NAME , &NAME ( ( &EMAIL ) ) &WEBSITE
