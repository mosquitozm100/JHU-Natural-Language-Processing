SUBJECT: Hi &NAME Along side my report I 've been doing some work with &NAME . I grabbed the opportunity to get her software working with mine because when I tried before she was quite busy . We 've been looking at the contribution a &NAME makes to the speed of learning . We can run experiments first using my learner on it 's own and then with the with the feedback from &NAME 's &NAME module . Looks like we 'll get quite a speed up in learning . Thought this might be interesting in terms of empricism vs. nativism , showing we can learn without a large amounts of innate knowledge but it it takes much longer and possibly too long in terms of the cut off . We have just noticed there is a conference ( boot-la - &CHAR think ) where this work might fit quite nicely . Do you think it would a good place to submit something ? I can ask my college for funds . &NAME
