Without the content-type field , it is unclear how to interpret the content , and thus for safety sake , my system will remove such emails from the corpus . I cannot assume that emails that do n't have content-type fields are always in plain text , as this is not the case with some of the emails I have already collected . This means that you would get a blank response from the &NAME EMAIL thing . In this case I added a content-type field , specifying plain text so you should have got a reply anyway . Have you got any idea why your email prog would leave out the content-type field ? Do many others use the same email client ? &NAME
