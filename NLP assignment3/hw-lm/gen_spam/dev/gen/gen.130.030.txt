SUBJECT: &NAMEing /usr / groups / corpora / trec8qa / tdxml / evidently does n't have all the questions in - what 's the correct directory to run &NAME on ? I have more than enough stuff for now , but we 'll need to start running &NAME over everything soonish , &NAME it 's taking a while . btw &NAME , could you edit that script to compress the output please ? also , would one of you give me a brief description of what you 're expecting the &NAME stuff to return ? You want me to output everything in the input , plus the &NAME , I assume ? Has someone sorted out filespace for where we 're going to put this stuff ? Cheers , &NAME
