SUBJECT: &NAME / &NAME - access to &NAME &NAME repository This is only relevant to those of you who use the &NAME or &NAME ( apologies for spam to the rest ) : The &NAME sources for the &NAME and &NAME are at &NAME - the versions on /usr / groups / nltools / lingo are generally out of date . We make releases &WEBSITE / ftp website but if you 're changing anything yourself or need the latest version , you ought to use &NAME from &NAME . A read-only account has now been introduced which allows this : cvs &CHAR : pserver : &EMAIL: &NAME login with password &NUM ' and then cvs &CHAR : pserver : &EMAIL: &NAME checkout erg or cvs &CHAR : pserver : &EMAIL &NAME checkout lkb You can then do cvs update etc as normal , though you ca n't check any changes in . If you do things that you think ought to be incorporated into the main version , let me know . It would probably be a good idea to let me know before putting a substantial amount of work into anything , even if you 're planning to keep it private , because the &NAME in particular is changing quite a lot at the moment . Please do n't distribute the password info outside the group - we do n't want this to be publicised generally . ( As you might guess , it 's intended primarily for the &NAME project , but it 's been agreed people here can use it too . ) &NAME
