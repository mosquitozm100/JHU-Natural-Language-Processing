It 's promised to be ' powerful ' , ' imaginative ' , breathtaking ' and of course . . ... ' edgy ' . It 's on Friday &NUM : &NAME , but if you want you , and anyone else who wants to come , would be welcome to come and have dinner before it starts ( our Hall food can actually be quite nice on Fridays &SMILEY and then mosey on over to the showing . Hopefully this ' edgy ' performance is enough to entice you away from your computer and &NAME ! ! And if not , just think of all the wonderful &NAME &NAME food you could feast on before hand ...
