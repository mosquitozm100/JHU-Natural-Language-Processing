SUBJECT: Update Hi &NAME , How are you ? I thought it was well past time I wrote you a quick email to tell you what has been happening down here . &NAME was spent writing up though not enough writing since I had to get an extension till the new year . I still have a lot to do ( and there 's only &NUM weeks left ! ) but I will hopefully be done soon . Submission day is January 6th which coincides with the start of my new job here in &NAME . I mentioned &NAME &NAME to you when I came to &NAME for the interview . Shortly after the &NAME visit , she mentioned an advert for a job and encouraged me to apply . It sounded like a very interesting project , certainly very different to what I do at the moment ... The hypothesis is that encouraging children to reflect on the double meanings in jokes leads to an increase in their text comprehension . Pilot studies have supported this . I get to work in the schools with the kids as well which is one of the very positive aspects to the project . The name of the project is &NAME . My role in it is , somewhat unsurprisingly , the techie person -- I write the software and the website . How is getting the course online going ? I am still planning on developing &NAME come the new year ... I hope you and your family are keeping well -- please send them my regards and season 's greetings ! Take care , &NAME . | &NAME &NAME | | &NAME , &NAME &NAME , &NAME | | &WEBSITE
