SUBJECT: Re : draft epsrc proposal I think it reads well , and I do n't really have any comments to make . I would be happy to provide a letter of support ( not committing &NAME to anything ! ) -- would you like it in the form of a letter to you ? On another topic , I 've just received &NAME 's revised thesis . Could you confirm what is required at this stage ? Presumably , ideally , a report saying all the required changes have been made and no oral is required . Could it be a 4-line job ? &NAME <QUOTE> &NAME and &NAME , I am sending you our draft proposal to do work on text classification . I 'd be grateful for any comments you have . In addition , if you felt that you were interested enough , a letter of support to accompany the proposal would be much appreciated as evidence of industry ' interest . best , &NAME <END_QUOTE>
