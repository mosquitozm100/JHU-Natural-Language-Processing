SUBJECT: [ &NAME ] Error tagging ? Dear list-members , Some colleagues and I are planning research on second language learning using a corpus of written texts . The second language is English and some of it will be quite low-proficiency . Ideally , we would like to be able to tag grammatical errors automatically . I 'd be most grateful if anyone could suggest appropriate software for such a task , or point me to recent literature where such software is reviewed . I 'll post a summary of any replies . Many thanks , &NAME &NAME Dr &NAME &NAME Department of English and &NAME &NAME &NAME &NAME &NAME &NAME BE &NUM &NAME &NAME &NAME : &NUM / &NUM ext &NUM &NAME : &NUM email : &EMAIL
