SUBJECT: Re : word simplification - project for &NAME &NAME <QUOTE> &NUM Analyse the CIDE / &NAME definitions for the target verbs to find the candidate substitutable terms . I am not sure whether this will be too difficult or not . The idea would be that if you had a definition like CIDE 's extinguish to stop ( a fire or light ) burning ' you 'd want to get something like stop ( &NAME ) burning ' <END_QUOTE> I suspect this will get quite interesting , for example the definition of ' douse ' is : to stop ( a fire or light ) burning or shining , esp . by putting water on it or covering it with something . ' so he 'll need to decide whether or not to get rid of parentheticals , and more importantly , whether he 's dousing a light or fire ! interestingly , the definition of extinguish does n't have the or shining ' bit in it . I suspect paraphrasing will only help when the paraphrase is reasonably short . Again , &NAME might be in a good position to decide on how short . &NAME seems to be the opposite of what the summarisation crowd call ' content conflation ' . Example from ( &NAME , &NUM ) : &NAME defeated &NAME &NUM . It was a tight game where the lead kept changing ' can be conflated to generate &NAME outlasted &NAME &NUM ' not quite sure how she does that though . definitely not from the cide definition of ' outlast ' .
