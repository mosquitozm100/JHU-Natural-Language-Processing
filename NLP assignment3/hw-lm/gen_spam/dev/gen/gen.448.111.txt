SUBJECT: Re : &NAME New Year ! Thanks for filling me in ! I 'm so glad you 're married with kids . I did n't wa n't to ask , but always hoped you would be . &NAME 's &NUM and &NAME almost &NUM . Both are working well and happily ( &NAME 's a mgt . consultant working in &NAME & driving lots , and &NAME is tech support for academic systems ) . They also picked wonderful mates : &NAME 's from &NAME , and after she finishes her 3-year associateship in &NAME ( &NUM hours away ) she 'll open her own dental practice there ; &NAME works in heating / refrigeration for the gas company and teaches part time at the college . They 're in &NAME . All &NUM are really neat people . I 'm very lucky.l . If you ever want to come to &NAME for a visit , bring the family . As you know , I have lots of room . Just bring your own clothes this time . Take care , &NAME At &NUM : &NUM &NAME &NUM / &NUM / &NUM &NUM , you wrote : <QUOTE> Hi , &NAME to hear from you after all this time -- I spend a bit of each summer on the Canadian shores of Lake &NAME not far from &NAME and &NUM and &NUM / &NUM hrs from &NAME , so if you are ever going to be in the area in August get in touch and come visit . I have &NUM kids ( &NAME , &NUM ; &NAME , &NUM ) and an American wife -- &NAME , who was born in &NAME ( hence the annual rtn ) . I do n't know about career thriving -- I am mid-career , in charge ' ( of administration ) , and wld like to be retired ' for time to do real research . I bike to school with &NAME on the crossbar and &NAME on her bike and then on to work every day . I 've stopped fencing for the moment except with plastic broadswords -- there are signs that at least &NAME will become a keen fancer via this route , but &NAME is going to be a singer , dancer and mummy in that order ' and is already quite genuinely accomplished at &NUM , averagely frighteningly &NUM teen at &NUM , and fastening onto other people 's babies with a vengance -- so probably no room for fencing . I hope life is treating you well and hope that we 'll meet again at some point all the best , &NAME <END_QUOTE>
