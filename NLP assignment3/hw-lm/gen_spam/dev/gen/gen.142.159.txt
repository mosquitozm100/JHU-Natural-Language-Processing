SUBJECT: Re : [ &NAME ] Question <QUOTE> Hello everybody , I would like to ask you a question : is it possible to convert a plain document ( written in the word processor ' word ' ) into a &NAME one ? ? <END_QUOTE> What do you mean with ' plain document ' ? You can write quite a lot of formats with word . If ' plain ' means ASCII-text with linefeeds , you can simply write a perl script like while ( ( ) ) { chomp ; print ' ( line ) ' ; print $ _ ; print ' ( /line)n ' ; You can also load your document with &NAME and save in &NAME 's native format -- it will be &NAME then , but the markup is probably not what you need . Cheers &NAME
