SUBJECT: Message from the Curator Message from the Curator There is a &NAME ' Book on the table next to the People 's Portraits exhibition . We had meant to have this available earlier , and consequently will have missed some visitors and their comments . If anyone has brought guests to see it or has comments of their own , we should welcome your entering their / your names and details . The names of those invited to the opening have already been entered , but do feel free to add a comment next to your name or on a later page if more space is required . If anyone connected with conferences knows of groups or individuals who have expressed particular interest in visiting the exhibition I should be grateful if they would enter those names . We should like this to be a record of attendance and response that we can use to assess the success ( or not ) of the exhibition , and the potential of any similar venture for the College in the future . Of course the &NAME ' Book will eventually be archived as a part of College history , so we should appreciate your keeping to real names and constructive remarks ! Thank you for your help with this . &NAME &NAME &NAME &NAME &NAME and &NAME &NAME College , &NAME &NAME &NAME &NAME &NUM ( &NUM ) &NUM &NUM &NAME &NUM ( &NUM ) &NUM &NUM If you wish to be removed from this mailing list please send an email to &NAME Leader ( &EMAIL )
