SUBJECT: email addresses ( Fwd ) Dear everyone , My apologies for for the misunderstanding which resulted in &NAME 's email being sent out to everyone inadvertantly . Fellows and staff email addresses are currently only available on the College intranet . An email policy is in preparation , &NUM aspect of which will be to ask people for permission to include email addresses on the College internet ( which means they will be accessible to anyone looking at our web site from anywhere in the world ) . In the meantime , we will NOT be putting anyone 's personal email address on the College internet . This is entirely separate to the University 's email address directory , which can be searched at : &WEBSITE It also works on the basis of ' opting in ' , which means that someone is only included in the directory if they have given explicit permission . Thank you . &NAME &NAME Secretary , &NAME College Web Site Committee &NAME &NAME &NAME : &NUM ( &NUM ) &NUM &NUM Assistant &NAME &NAME : &NUM ( &NUM ) &NUM &NUM &WEBSITE / &NAME , &NAME 0JG Dear All Due to the restrictions laid down by the data protection act I need your explicit permission to put your email address on the web pages . At the moment the information is only available within &NAME , if you would like your email address to be available to a wider audience , please could you reply to me . Anyone who does not reply will have their email address removed from the web pages so that we can comply with the legislation . Many thanks for your help in this matter &NAME &NAME &NAME Health & Safety Officer & &NAME &NAME College &NAME &NAME &NUM &NUM If you can stay calm , while all around you is chaos ... then you probably have n't completely understood the seriousness of the situation .
