SUBJECT: Re : mtg &NAME &NAME wrote on &NUM &NUM : &NUM &NAME : <QUOTE> Yes , let 's cancel unless we hear from &NAME or &NAME that they have agenda items <END_QUOTE> Nothing particular comes to mind , so feel free to cancel it . What I would have probabaly said is n't urgent and can also be mentioned here : &CHAR ) We now have a nicely formatted automatically generated &NAME catalogue in &NAME with abstracts for the newer &NUM : &WEBSITE &CHAR ) The entire &NAME database was carefully checked against what is actually on the shelf by &NAME and &NAME , which I think deserves thankful mentioning in some later meeting minutes . &CHAR ) I have now also a semiautomatic mechanism in place that sends &NAME students an invitation to turn their thesis into a &NAME as soon as it shows up as approved in the student-admin database . &CHAR ) I 'm working with &NAME and &NAME to ensure that we keep a good bibliographic record of all accepted PhD theses in the lab database ( there were a couple of odd glitches to be fixed , e.g. so far we recorded only the first &NUM characters of thesis titles for obscure reasons ) . I believe , this information should go onto the web at some point when the data set is reliable enough . &CHAR ) We still have no mechanism in place to ensure that all approved lab PhD theses are easily accessible to other lab members ( other than having to go to the UL ) . &CHAR significant fraction of students disappear after submission without turning their thesis into a &NAME or at least hand &NAME a copy . &NAME &NAME &NAME , &ORG , &NAME of &NAME , &NAME &WEBSITE
