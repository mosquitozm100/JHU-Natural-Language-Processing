SUBJECT: Re : &NAME OK , it 's ready for you . Shall I drop it into the lab ? &NAME <QUOTE> This is very kind of you . I will need a signed copy and it would be helpful if it was on &NAME headed paper and included your job title etc. The chief value of such letters to &NAME is in support of the relevance to beneficaries ' so would you add a sentence asserting that &NAME is invovled in information management ' ( their term ) and interested , in principle , in exploiting advances in text classification ? thanks , &NAME <END_QUOTE>
