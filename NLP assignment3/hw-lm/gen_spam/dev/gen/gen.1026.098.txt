SUBJECT: [ &NAME ] &ORG-2003 2nd &NAME : &NAME Expressions 2nd CALL FOR PAPERS &ORG-2003 Workshop on &NAME Expressions : &NAME , &NAME and &NAME &NUM July &NUM , &NAME , &NAME WEBSITES Workshop website : &WEBSITE &NAME website : &WEBSITE WORKSHOP DESCRIPTION &NAME expressions ( &NAME ) include a large range of linguistic phenomenon , such as phrasal verbs ( e.g. ' add up ' ) , nominal compounds ( e.g. ' telephone box ' ) , and institutionalized phrases ( e.g. ' salt and &NAME ' ) , and they can be syntactically and / or semantically idiosyncratic in nature . &NAME are used frequently in everyday language , usually to express precisely ideas and concepts that cannot be compressed into a single word . A considerable amount of research has been devoted to this subject , both in terms of theory and practice , but despite increasing interest in idiomaticity within linguistic research , there is still a gap between the needs of &NAME and the descriptive tradition of linguistics . Owing to the lack of adequate resources to identify and treat &NAME properly , they pose a real challenge for &NAME . Most real-world applications tend to ignore &NAME or address them simply by listing . However , it is clear that successful applications will need to be able to identify and treat them appropriately . This particularly applies to the many applications which require some degree of semantic processing ( e.g. machine translation , question-answering , summarisation , generation ) . In recent years there has been a growing awareness in the &NAME community of the problems that &NAME pose and the need for their robust handling . A considerable amount of research has been conducted in this area , some within large research projects dedicated to &NAME ( e.g. the &NAME Expression Project ) . There is also a growing interest in &NAME in projects focused on tasks such as parsing ( e.g. Robust Accurate &NAME &NAME ( &NAME ) ) and word sense disambiguation ( e.g. MEANING - &NAME &NAME &NAME Language Technologies ) which are required by real-world applications . Previous workshops on &NAME have focused on certain &NAME types , notably collocations , terminology and named entities . There are , however , further subtypes of &NAME , which are highly relevant for &NAME tasks but which have not to date received specific attention . &NUM example are lexicalised ( non- or semi-compositional ) &NAME which raise specific issues for applications which require semantic interpretation . TARGET AUDIENCE This workshop is intended to bring together &NAME researchers working on all areas of &NAME . The objective is to summarise what has been achieved in the area , to establish common themes between different approaches , and to discuss future trends , with particular emphasis on addressing the problems that different &NAME ( sub ) types pose for real-world &NAME applications . AREAS OF INTEREST Papers are invited on , but not limited to , the following topics : * Theoretical research on &NAME * &NAME taxonomies , classifications and databases * Corpus based analysis of &NAME * Cross-lingual analysis of &NAME types , use , and behaviour * Methods for identification and extraction of &NAME ( machine learning , statistical , example- or rule-based , or hybrid ) * Evaluation of &NAME extraction methods * Integration of &NAME data into grammars and &NAME applications ( e.g. machine translation and generation ) * &NAME &NAME ( or &NAME types ) pose for &NAME applications and solutions proposed Papers can cover &NUM or more of these areas .
