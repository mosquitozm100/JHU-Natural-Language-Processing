I enclose a reference for &NAME &NAME , which you may disclose on request . I am writing in reply for your request for a reference for &NAME &NAME . &NAME undertook the Diploma in Computer Science last academic year . She chose a project on junk email filtering which I supervised . She worked hard at the project , improving her programming and statistical skills , and demonstrated considerable initiative , taking the project well beyond the core component I had specified . She showed that she was able to plan and undertake a significant software implementation and design and evaluate experiments assessing the quality of her system . She is quiet and a little diffident but I found her very pleasant to work with and , as time passed , she relaxed and became more confident . I have little doubt that she would fit in well into your office and work diligently and effectively . yours , &NAME &NAME ( &NAME in Computational Linguistics ) &ORG University of &NAME &NAME &NAME Ave &NAME &NAME &NAME , &NAME Email : &EMAIL Web page : &WEBSITE &NAME : &NUM &NUM &NAME : &NUM &NUM The information in this email is confidential and may be legally privileged .
