SUBJECT: Some references Hi &NAME , I 've been working on the reviewers comments on the &NAME paper for &NAME and there were a couple of references which might be useful for the proposal : &NAME , &NAME , et &NAME . ( &NUM ) : Event Extraction from Biomedical Papers using a Full &NAME , in Proceedings of &NAME &NUM . &WEBSITE &NAME , &NAME , et &NAME . ( &NUM ) : A Pragmatic Information Extraction Strategy for gathering Data on Genetic Interaction , In proceedings of 8th International Conference on Intelligent Systems for Molecular Biology . &WEBSITE The &NAME stuff is very like what we did on &NAME and contains some good motivation for doing full &NAME analysis . While I 'm doing the corrections , I 'd like to make sure I refer correctly to the &NAME version that we used , so can you tell me ( &CHAR ) whether you are happy with us referring to it the &NAME and ( &CHAR ) whether there is something wrong with these points where we cite you : &NUM ' This interpretation task therefore gave us the opportunity to compare &NUM parsers : &NAME 's &NAME partial parser cite { Abney : &NAME and &NAME & &NAME 's Tag Sequence Grammar ( { sc tsg } ) parser cite { &NAME : &NAME : &NAME . ' where cite { &NAME : &NAME : 01 } is bibitem [ protectcitename { &NAME & &NAME , } 2001]{ &NAME : &NAME : &NAME { sc &NAME , &NAME , & &NAME , &NAME . &NUM . newblock &NAME precision extraction of grammatical relations . newblock { em Pages &NUM of:} { em Proceedings of the 7th acl / sigparse international workshop on parsing technologies } . &NUM ' In order to compare the relative utility among the various linguistic resources available , we in fact acquired several models for interpreting nominalisations and compared their performance on the interpretation task . These models varied along the following dimensions . First , they either used verb-argument counts acquired from &NAME 's shortcite { Abney : &NAME parser &NAME or from &NAME and &NAME 's shortcite { &NAME : &NAME : &NAME tag sequence grammar ( the tsg ) .

The statistical parser , known as the Tag Sequence Grammar ( tsg ) parser , uses a hand-crafted grammar where the lexical entries are pos tags rather than the word forms themselves .
