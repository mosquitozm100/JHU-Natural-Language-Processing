SUBJECT: Re : &NAME &NAME &NAME I 'm sorry , but I already have a shortage in people talking at the first meeting ( June ) . Moreover , there is supposed to be a balance between levels and subjects . Could I therefore ask you to give your talk this time ? Sorry about that . This talk is nothing ultra-formal . Just talk about what you 've done / are doing , and it 'll be great . Thanks &NAME <QUOTE> Oh , sorry , I did n't expect to be on &NAME 's list of speakers , I 'd got the date down , though . I shall have to think of something to talk about now . I 've not a problem with either the 27th , or very many dates in July . It would probably be best if I spoke in July , though , rather than the coming one . &NAME . <END_QUOTE>
