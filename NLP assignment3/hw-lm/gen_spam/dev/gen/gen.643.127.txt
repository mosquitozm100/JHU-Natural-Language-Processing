SUBJECT: Re : &NAME &NAME : [ &NAME ] &NAME : &NAME &NAME and Language Spec ial Issue on &NAME &NAME &NAME Sure I will ! &NAME &NAME , Would you arrange for publication of this CfP in &NAME etc as you proposed ? many thanks , &NAME - ------ Forwarded Message Apologies for multiple postings . Call for Papers : Journal of &NAME &NAME Special Issue on WORD SENSE DISAMBIGUATION &NAME editors : &NAME &NAME , &NAME University , &EMAIL &NAME &NAME , University of &NAME , &EMAIL The process of automatically determining the meanings of words , word sense disambiguation ( &NAME ) , is an important stage in language understanding . It has been shown to be useful for many natural language processing applications including machine translation , information retrieval ( mono- and cross-lingual ) , corpus analysis , summarization and document navigation . The usefulness of &NAME has been acknowledged since the 1950's and the field has recently enjoyed a resurgence of interest including the creation of &NAME , an evaluation exercise allowing a basic precision / recall comparison of participating systems , which has been run twice to date . The current availability of large corpora and powerful computing resources has made the exploration of machine learning and statistical methods possible . This is in contrast to the majority of early approaches which relied on hand-crafted disambiguation rules . This special issue of &NAME &NAME , due for publication in &NUM , is intended to describe the current state of the art in word sense disambiguation . Papers are invited on all aspects of &NAME research , and especially on : * Combinations of methods and knowledge sources . Which methods or knowledge sources complement each other and which provide similar disambiguation information ? How should they be combined ? Do better disambiguation results justify the extra cost of producing systems which combine multiple techniques or use multiple knowledge sources ? Can any method or knowledge source be determined to be better or worse than another ? * Evaluation of &NAME systems . Which metrics are most informative and would new &NUM be useful ? Can &NAME be evaluated in terms of the effect it has on another language processing task , for example parsing ? Can evaluations using different data sets ( corpora and lexical resources ) be compared ? Can the cost of producing evaluation data be reduced through the use of automatic methods ? * Sense distinctions and sense inventories . How do these affect &NAME ? How does the granularity of the lexicon affect the difficulty of the &NAME task ? Are some types of sense distinction difficult to distinguish in text ? What can be gained from combining sense inventories and how can this be done ? * The effect of &NAME on applications . To what extent does &NAME help applications such as machine translation or text retrieval ? What kind of disambiguation is most useful for these applications ? What is the effect when the disambiguation algorithm makes mistakes ? * Minimising the need for hand-tagged data . Hand-tagged text is expensive and difficult to obtain while un-tagged text is plentiful and , effectively , limitless . What techniques can be used to make use of un-tagged text , would weakly / semi-supervised learning algorithms be useful ? What use can be made of parallel text ? Can un-tagged text be made as useful as disambiguated text ? Submission Information &NAME &NAME &NAME : &NUM October &NUM All submissions will be subject to the normal peer review process for this journal . Submissions in electronic form ( &NAME ) are strongly preferred and must conform to the &NAME specifications , which are available at : &WEBSITE Any initial queries , should be addressed to &EMAIL - ------ End of Forwarded Message
