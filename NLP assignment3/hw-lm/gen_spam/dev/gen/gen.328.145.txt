SUBJECT: Re : [ &NAME ] Re : Re : hyperonyms - WordNet extractions I also do not see why you should n't be able to do with with &NAME ( or &NAME for that matter at &WEBSITE and ' Lingua ' . By the way , simple text files are really not the way to go for more complex semantic relationships . You run into all sorts of trouble when if / when your ontology has to track links across multiple tree structures . You might want to have a look at ( &NAME ) topic maps .

But I do n't <END_QUOTE> know if I can use the very useful linguistic information provided by WordNet to create my own lexicons . In fact , I need to have , in a txt file , simple lists such : <QUOTE> physical entity <QUOTE> organism <QUOTE> animal plant <END_QUOTE> <END_QUOTE> I ca n't save all words ! So , I 'd like to have either the ability to <END_QUOTE> program &NAME with WordNet or to find another lexicon . <QUOTE> The goal of this list is to contribute to find the new information <END_QUOTE> in a discurse in order to model prosody . <QUOTE> I hope that my explanations are clear . <END_QUOTE> There are packages for the major scripting languages that allow you access to &NAME , I personally use the &NAME package . If you search for that in the web , you 'll find it . With the scripting languages you can easilly create something what you have in mind . If you install WordNet on &NAME , you have the possibility to access the functionality and the data easily in even &NAME . best wishes &NAME &NAME &NAME &WEBSITE <END_QUOTE> &NAME &NAME &NAME &EMAIL
