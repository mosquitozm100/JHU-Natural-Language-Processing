SUBJECT: &NAME software Everybody concerned with teaching is reminded that the &NAME machines ( which include the student workstations in the Intel Lab and &NAME &NUM ) are updated by the &NAME Service according to a strict annual timetable . Now is the time to be thinking about any changes that may be needed for the academic year &NUM . It would probably be best if requests for changes were channelled through &NAME or me , particularly if they might have financial implications . A copy of the formal notice from the Director of the &NAME Service follows : ' University Computing Service : Notice by the Director Public Workstation Facility application / teaching software for the academical year &NUM This notice is addressed to all those who currently use or who are planning to use the Public Workstation Facility ( &NAME ) , including &NAME &NAME stations , to support their teaching whether for organized courses or for teaching which depends more generally on applications on the &NAME . Requests for new application software or for new versions of application software are needed by the &NAME Service by the end of Full &NAME &NAME ( Friday , &NUM March &NUM ) . They should be submitted either by e-mail ( &EMAIL ) or in writing to the &NAME Manager , University Computing Service , &NAME &NAME &NAME . Software for which requests are received later than this date will not necessarily be installed in time for the start of the &NAME &NAME . It would also be helpful to be informed of any software that is no longer required . The list of software which the &NAME Service plans to make available for the start of the &NAME &NAME will be announced on the &NAME Wide Web by the division of the &NAME &NAME . The programme of installation of the new software will need to start immediately after the end of Full &NAME &NAME , in order that it can be completed by Monday , &NUM September . This time-scale will enable those , whose teaching depends on these applications , to check that they work correctly and to allow for any necessary remedial action to be taken before the start of the &NAME &NAME . Those requesting software , whether new applications or upgrades to existing software , are asked to consider the budgetary implications of their requests for themselves and sites . Those teaching over the period of the Long Vacation should note that the installation of new versions of &NAME software may have implications for them . '
