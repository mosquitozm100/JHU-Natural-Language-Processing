Foreign language pedagogy is now beginning to see new possibilities for recent advances in corpus linguistics to improve language teaching and learning . Readily available Korean-language corpora and easy-to-use tools can now be used on the spot in a language teaching context , by teachers and learners without extensive training in computational linguistics , and studies of linguistic features can be tailored to specific pedagogic context and learning requirements . The &NAME &NAME Institute workshop ' Corpus Linguistics for Korean Language Learning and &NAME ' will acquaint participants with the basic concepts of corpus linguistics , including corpus construction and &NAME , concordancing , frequency counts and ranks , grammatical tagging , and related concepts . Participants will learn how to access Korean corpora and how to use the available computer programs for Korean corpus analysis . The workshop will outline techniques for the teacher to use in materials preparation and curriculum design and for the individual learner to use in exploring meaning , structure , and use in Korean . In the second part of the workshop , participants will engage in individual projects chosen with their own learning goals in mind .
