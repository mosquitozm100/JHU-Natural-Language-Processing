SUBJECT: Re : &NAME / &NAME &NAME &NAME ' &NUM and &NAME SI Many thanks &NAME . I 'll put these points to the &NAME . I know there is a strong view that the time between the WShops and publication of the SI should be short as possible ( without compromising standards ) . As to number of papers , my guess would be possibly as many &NUM given the status of the meetings , but we could simply restrict it to the &NUM or &NUM for &NUM issue . Otherwise , all seems well . I 'll cc send this message to the &NAME for comment .

To move forwards , we need more information &CHAR ) We will need the names of the guest editors to be appointed - preferably &NUM . &CHAR ) We need a draft schedule to publication so that we can identify the best issue to allocate to you . I assume that you will select authors at or around the time of the workshop . You then need to give them time to produce the full paper , send it out to referees , allow revisions , final review and accept . ( This looks to me like 4th quarter &NUM or 1st quarter &NUM ) &CHAR ) A single issue of &NAME will accommodate &NUM or &NUM papers . To accommodate more we would have to make it a double issue . How many papers do you anticipate accepting ? If you can answer the above , then the editors can make a final decision . Note that we expect the same quality standards as for regular submissions to &NAME . Each accepted paper must have been reviewed by &NUM independent reviewers . The guest editors make the accept / reject decision but one of the regular &NAME editors is assigned to assist in the process ( probably me in this case ) . If you have detailed questions about publication procedures , please contact &NAME van der &NAME at &NAME ( for email see cc list ) . &NAME <QUOTE> &NAME , I 've been asked to follow-up some previous emails ( copied below ) . In brief , &NAME ' &NUM and &NAME &NAME &NAME &NUM workshops are seeking a journal special issue . The relevant &NAME is attached . In essence we 'd like to repeat the successful previous &NAME practice : selected papers for a journal SI . Last time it was with &NAME and this time we 'd like a more speech related one , our first preference being &NAME . A key factor is publication date : this should be as soon after &NAME date ( &NAME &NUM ) as possible . What are your thoughts ? I 've attached below some history emails .

Hi &NAME ( and &NAME ) , Thank you for letting me know your thoughts and plans . We are pursuing publication options in parallel and are still very interested in &NAME . We look forward to hearing further from &NAME after you 've had a chance to talk . Would you like any additional information from us ? &NAME regards , &NAME &NAME &NAME wrote : <QUOTE> &NAME , I 'm sorry for the delay in response . I 'm actually stepping down from being editor of &NAME at the end of June , so I 'm not sure that I should have much of a role in the decision . I 'm cc-ing &NAME on this email and will try to talk to him about it in the next couple weeks . We were interested earlier , but we are getting a bit of a backlog , so we need to look at that to assess whether the timing still makes sense . &NAME Hi &NAME , I believe that we approached you some time ago to investigate the possibility of a special issue of the Computer Speech & Language journal on &NAME &NUM : The Speaker and Language Recognition Workshop ( I 've attached the draft &NAME with more details ) . ( Given that the &NAME &NAME ' &NUM Workshop will be held in conjunction with &NAME ' &NUM , we might want to consider including papers from both workshops in the special issue . ) I recall you being favorable to our query , although we had not yet formulated a real proposal . Can you still accommodate us ? If so , under what parameters / conditions ( e.g. , turn around time , page count , page size , guest editor / &CHAR ) ? Are you also working under &NAME van der &NAME and , if so , would you like me to ask her about this ? We published a special issue of &NAME journal using an expedited round-robin review process on the &NAME Speaker &NAME &NAME &NUM that was published as almost &NUM &NAME &NAME ' pages in a triple volume within only a few months . I think the quality of the papers was reasonably good , although we might have erred on accepting a few too many papers for the special issue and disrupting &NAME 's page quotas for that year . There was a special issue of Speech Communication on an &NAME predecessor workshop , but that took much longer ( too long ? ) to publish . I 've included an excerpt from some discussions on these pros and cons and would like to know if you agree with this assessment , especially with respect to &NAME .
