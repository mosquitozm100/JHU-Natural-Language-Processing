The GenSpam corpus, released in 2006, was created by Ben Medlock, a
Ph.D. student at Cambridge University, in order to test and compare
various spam detection techniques.  It is described here:

The version presented in these directories has been simplified for you
in various ways.  In particular, it is plain text, not XML, and the
training messages have all been concatenated together for convenience.
So real research should use the original GenSpam corpus, not this one.

The spam data come from www.spamarchive.org.  The "Gen" (genuine) data
come from 15 real individuals, and have been anonymized using NLP
techniques to protect confidentiality, as follows:

   We use the RASP [3] part-of-speech tagger as well as ﬁfinite-state
   techniques to identify and anonymise proper names, numbers, email
   addresses and URLs. The following tokens are used in place of their
   respective references:

   &NAME (proper names)
   &CHAR (individual characters)•
   &NUM (numbers)
   &EMAIL (email addresses)
   &URL (internet urls)
