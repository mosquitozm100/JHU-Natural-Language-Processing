SUBJECT: CHANGE OF DATE : &NAME &NAME Sorry - the date of the following seminar has been changed to the 22nd of October . Natural Language and Information Processing Group Seminar &NAME : The Interaction of Language Learning and Evolution Speaker : &NAME &NAME 12pm , Tuesday 22nd October Room GW22 , &NAME Laboratory , &NAME &NAME Building , &NAME &NAME Avenue &WEBSITE &NAME : I will describe some models of natural languages as dynamical systems ( linguistic variants are differentially inherited " through child language learning ) , in some cases with adaptation ( linguistic selection amongst variants , natural selection for better language learners ) . The " natural " in " natural language " is mainly a marker to distinguish the study of human languages from that of logics or programming languages . The distinction has been methodologically without much content as formal linguistics treats human language as a static well-formed stringset and employs similar tools -- formal language theory , denotational semantics -- to theoretical computer science . Most linguists would probably agree with &NAME &NAME 's famous dictum , " I reject the contention that an important theoretical difference exists between formal and natural languages " , because not to would appear to preclude the possibility of formal linguistics . However , this has meant that , the focus has been on the individual speaker and her idiolect , whilst the study of language change and variation has remained mostly descriptive and unsystematic . Dynamical systems , such as the weather , can be rule-governed , complex ( in the sense of unpredictable ) , but not adaptive . Others , such as the immune system , are adaptive and complex . Complexity can arise through constraints on variation as well as through competing selection pressures . Constraints on language variation are a consequence of the cognitive capacities and limitations of the language users -- just as the constraints of biochemistry places limitations on variation in biological organisms . If language is adaptive for its users , and linguistic selection pressures for greater learnability , expressiveness and interpretability are often in conflict , then ( co-evolutionary ) interactions are predicted , and the adaptive landscape will be complex with many local optima and no fixed attractors . Nevertheless , stochastic computational simulations of such models , can shed light on major theoretical linguistic issues , such as : are commonalities amongst the world 's languages necessarily a consequence of an innate language faculty ? ; under what conditions would such a faculty evolve ? ; or is language change a directional process ?

SUBJECT: &NUM &NAME &NAME : 5th November and 8th November Natural Language and Information Processing Group Seminar &WEBSITE / 12pm , Tuesday 5th November , &NAME &ORG , &NAME &NAME Building , &NAME &NAME Avenue &WEBSITE &NAME : Focusing Effects in &NAME Resolution : Computational Influences and &NAME &NAME Speaker : &NAME &NAME - &NAME University &NAME : &NAME research based on &NAME &NAME ( &NAME , &NAME , and &NAME , &NUM ) has reached the conclusion that an ambiguous pronoun is interpreted immediately as referring to the entity assumed to constitute the local discourse focus , even in the presence of prior semantic information that makes this interpretation implausible . This contrasts with other experimental research which supports the position that discourse focus exerts a weak influence on pronominal interpretation and is overridden by pragmatic plausibility considerations . Moreover , there is substantial experimental research demonstrating that , even though the processes of resolving a pronoun are initiated as soon as the pronoun is encountered , they are not brought to completion until much later , especially in the case of ambiguous pronouns . Such a result is hardly compatible with the assumption of immediacy of interpretation underlying Centering-motivated research . In this talk I will argue that the discrepancies between &NAME and other psycholinguistic research on focusing and pronominal resolution can be attributed to some extent to the fact that these approaches do not always share the same definition of focus ; that they employ different experimental paradigms ; and that perhaps they probe different aspects of the resolution process . Finally , I will briefly discuss the extent to which a computational model such as &NAME &NAME , which is based on distributional observations ( &NAME , &NUM ) , can adequately explain psychological processes in general . 12pm , Friday 8th November , &NAME &NAME &NAME , &NAME &NAME Building , &NAME &NAME Avenue &WEBSITE &NAME : A Lightweight Approach to &NAME &NAME and Conversational Natural Language Speaker : &NAME &NAME - &NAME &NAME &NAME : Many approaches to natural language processing require large dictionaries , large grammars or both .

While several medium- to large-scale treebanks exist for English and some other languages , pre-existing publicly available resources exhibit &NUM or more of the following limitations : ( &CHAR ) &NAME is monostratal , either encoding topological ( phrase structure ) or dependency information , ( ii ) the depth of linguistic information recorded is relatively shallow , ( iii ) the design and format of linguistic representation in the tree-bank hard-wires a small , predefined range of ways in which information can be extracted from the treebank , and ( iv ) representations in existing treebanks are static , creating challenges both for consistency during the development of a large-scale treebank , and for relevance over time as the field advances . &NAME &NAME aims at the development of a novel treebanking methodology , rich in nature and dynamic both in the ways linguistic data can be retrieved from the treebank in varying granularity and in the constant evolution and regular updating of the treebank itself . Since July &NUM , the project hsa been working to build the foundations for this new type of treebank , developing improved tools for treebank construction and maintenance , and constructing an initial set of &NUM , &NUM annotated trees hand-selected from the full set of analyses for each example produced by the &NAME English Resource Grammar ( &NAME ) . Both the tools and the data are distributed together with the &NAME system and the &NAME under an open-source license . In this talk I provide an overview of the Redwoods initiative , demonstrate the available tools , and report on the current results of the first update of the treebank to reflect improvements in the &NAME during the period from July &NUM to October &NUM . &NAME : &NAME &NAME , &NAME &NAME , &NAME &NAME , &NAME &NAME , &NAME &NAME , and &NAME &NAME ( All welcome - For instructions on how to get to the &ORG , please see : &WEBSITE )

SUBJECT: &NAME &NAME Tuesday 3rd December Natural Language and Information Processing Group Seminar &WEBSITE / &NAME : Automatic indexing and retrieval of crime-scene photographs : having recourse to Natural Language Processing Speaker : &NAME &NAME - &NAME University &NUM noon , Tuesday 3rd December , Room &NAME &ORG , &NAME &NAME Building , &NAME &NAME Avenue &WEBSITE &NAME : Current approaches in automatic text-based image indexing fail in capturi ng semantic information expressed in the captions , that is important for the subsequent retrieval of the images . The indexing and retrieval prototype developed within the Scene Of Crime Information System ( SOCIS ) project attempts to go beyond keyword-based approaches and methods that extract syntactic relations from captions . SOCIS relies on advanced Natural Language Processing techniques in order to extract relational facts from captions . These relational facts consist of a pragmatic relation '' and the entities this relation connects ( triples of the form : ARG1 - &NAME &NAME ) . In SOCIS , the triples are used as complex image indexing terms ; however , the extraction mechanism is used not only for indexing purposes but also for image retrieval . Extracting the corresponding relational structures from free - natural language queries , SOCIS attempts to match the query triples to the indexing triple &CHAR and retrieve the appropriate images with high precision and recall . We have implemented this approach for crime investigation , an application domain where efficient querying of large crime-scene photograph databases is of crucial importance . In this presentation , I will start with a demonstration of the current SO &NAME prototype and an overview of the application scenario and I will then focus on the &NAME techniques used for developing the prototype . The main extraction mechanism will be presented , as well as a preliminary retrieval mechanism ( the " query triples - indexing triples " matching mechanism ) .

The main extraction mechanism will be presented , as well as a preliminary retrieval mechanism ( the " query triples - indexing triples " matching mechanism ) .

SUBJECT: &NAME &NAME Tuesday 21st January Natural Language and Information Processing Group Seminar &WEBSITE / 12pm , Tuesday 21st January , &NAME &ORG , &NAME &NAME Building , &NAME &NAME Avenue &WEBSITE &NAME : Grammatical Relations , &NAME &NAME and Question Answering Speaker : &NAME &NAME - University of &NAME &NAME : In this talk , I will give an overview of my PhD thesis work on automatically finding grammatical relations to verbs in English . Grammatical relations ( &NAME ) , such as subject , direct object , temporal or locative adjunct , are interesting from a theoretical as well as from a practical point of view because they constitute a link between syntax and semantics . &NUM approach to finding &NAME is to have a parser construct a full parse of a sentence and to extract &NAME from the parse tree afterwards . By contrast , our relation finder directly extracts grammatical relations from part-of-speech tagged and chunked text . The relation finder is implemented through a supervised machine learning algorithm , viz . &NAME &NAME . I will briefly explain &NAME &NAME , show how I derived training and test material from the &NAME &NAME and give a summary of results . In the second part , I will show how &NAME can be used for open domain question answering ( QA ) on the &NAME . I will introduce the &NAME task and its evaluation , explain how I implemented a &NAME prototype and show examples of successes and failures .

SUBJECT: NL&IP Seminar Tuesday 28th January Natural Language and Information Processing Group Seminar &WEBSITE / 12pm , Tuesday 28th January , &NAME &ORG , &NAME &NAME Building , &NAME &NAME Avenue &WEBSITE &NAME : Document filtering : tasks , models and implementation Speaker : &NAME &NAME - &NAME Research &NAME : Much information retrieval research revolves around a canonical model of a search task : a user issuing a query to a ( temporarily static ) document collection , and being presented with a ranked list of documents ( with perhaps a feedback loop ) . This model informs many aspects of the work - - the kinds of theoretical approach taken , many implementation issues including the design of efficient , fast-response systems , the measurement of effectiveness and the qualitative testing of systems . However , we may take a number of different views of the information task itself and the user context in which that task occurs . &NUM alternative is represented by the filtering task , as defined for the &NAME exercise . Here filtering is seen as a content-based , adaptive task applied to an incoming stream of documents , involving user needs represented by profiles . In this talk , I will explore the nature of this task , and some of the ways in which it must be treated differently from the canonical model . I will address both conceptual and implementation issues , and discuss some experimental results from &NAME . ( All welcome - For instructions on how to get to the &ORG , please see : &WEBSITE )

Typical approaches based on information extraction technology will usually focus on shallow semantics such as named entities in order to build up a template view of part of the text but this approach suffers from not being able to offer the computer a deeper understanding of the mined information or allowing this deeper understanding to feed back and influence the tempate filling process . In order to increase portability of knowledge and to allow the text mining system to incorporate deeper semantic knowledge of concept classes , properties ( slots ) , relations and axioms we are developing a front-end environment which allows domain-experts to specify such knowledge cooperatively online in the form of an ontology . Once an ontology has been agreed , a representative set of texts can be annotated according to the specified classes and given to the information extraction system to learn from so that future texts in the domain can be automatically mined for similar facts . This talk introduces an overview of the system and also focuses in some detail on experiments we have recently done using support vector machines in extending the named entity task to domain-based terminology identification and classification for functional genomics .

SUBJECT: NL&IP Seminar Tuesday 25th &NAME Natural Language and Information Processing Group Seminar &WEBSITE / 12pm , Tuesday 25th &NAME , FW11 &ORG , &NAME &NAME Building , &NAME &NAME Avenue &WEBSITE &NAME : &NAME - A &NAME &NAME Approach to &NAME &NAME . Speaker : &NAME &NAME - &NAME University &NAME : &NAME is a type of figurative language where &NUM entity is used to refer to another related entity . A typical example is ( &NUM ) Does he drive a &NAME ? In ( &NUM ) , the name of a company " &NAME " is used to refer to a car produced by that company . Most traditional approaches to metonymy understanding rely on large amounts of world knowledge and are not easily scalable and / or portable . In the MASCARA project we explored supervised statistical classification methods as an alternative approach . We will present the following results : &NUM The regularity and productivity of metonymic readings make it possible to reduce metonymy understanding to a classification task comparable to classic word sense disambiguation for the large majority of metonymic readings . &NUM Grammatical argument-head relations are an appropriate feature for such a classification task and , in particular , more predictive for metonymy recognition than e.g. , collocations . &NUM Data sparseness in argument-head relations can be at least partially overcome by the integration of thesaurus information without increasing the size of the training data . &NUM We also explore the effect that parser accuracy has on the recognition algorithm and compare the difficulty of metonymy recognition to classic word sense disambiguation .

This talk focuses on the automatic induction of verb classes : a clustering methodology is developed which utilises the relationship between verb meaning components and verb behaviour to provide a classification of German verbs . In the first part of the talk , I describe the acquisition of lexical syntactic and semantic verb properties from an unsupervised trained statistical grammar model . The properties are used to define German verbs on &NUM levels of verb description , purely syntactic frame types , prepositional phrase information and selectional preferences . In the second part of the talk , I describe the adjustment of the standard clustering algorithm k-Means to the task of inducing semantic verb classes from the various verb descriptions . The clustering parameters , clustering evaluation and clustering results are interpreted and discussed . ( All welcome - For instructions on how to get to the &ORG , please see : &WEBSITE )

SUBJECT: lg1 practicals Hi , Just a friendly ( I hope ) message to say that we noticed you did n't have the tick for session one of the practicals yet . There 's no requirement to get a tick every week as long as you get them all by the end of term , so if this is just because you forgot , or the demonstrator was too busy , or whatever , then that 's fine .

SUBJECT: &NAME files All but one of the answer files are now in /usr / groups / mphil / qa03 / rmrs / ans - the missing &NUM files are &NUM , &NUM , &NUM and &NUM . If we can repair the problems we will add those files and let you know . Otherwise these are the final versions for this practical ( unless very serious bugs are reported ) . You may notice that the dates have changed on some of the files that you had before - these files should be otherwise identical to the versions you have been looking at . Although the old &NAME and &NAME files remain , please use the top_docs files instead . I have replaced ques-out-jan29.rmrs with a version which has &NUM structure for each of the &NUM sentences ( the older version had &NUM structures missing ) . There should be a &NUM mapping between the sentences in this file and the answer files , apart from the missing answer files mentioned above . Please let me know at once if you suspect that this is still not the case . I will attempt to answer all the outstanding questions that you have sent tonight or on Sunday if not .

SUBJECT: practicals &NUM ) the &NUM missing .rmrs files are now in the same directory as the others - there should be no further changes or additions &WEBSITE which contains lines of the form base &NAME &NAME ... derivedn where the base is always a verb ( because I 've only done things which can be taken to have a base verb ) and the derived forms are mostly nouns ( but there 's the occasional adjective ) e.g. &NAME &NAME It only contains forms where either the base form or a derived form is in the questions . Note that I 've entered the " ing " forms as &CHAR since that 's how the &NAME treats them when they occur prenominally ( the &NAME will generally treat these as derived , however , so you get the base relation and a nominalize_rel ) . However , &NAME at least sometimes tags them as adjectives and does n't treat them as derived . Some zero-derived forms are included . The file was created semi-automatically and is no doubt buggy in some respects - if you improve it , you should make this clear in your writeup and include the improved version with the code you submit . &NAME 
SUBJECT: access to machines in the Intel lab Just to let you know that your COTAG cards should now allow you access to the Intel lab ( big room full of machines on the other end of the top floor from the &NAME rooms ) . This may be useful if you want access to a &NAME machine ( or , when the weather is better , if you 'd like to sit on the balcony watching the horses ... ) If you do use the lab , please note that , though it 's rarely full , there are times when it 's used intensively and undergraduates and Diploma students always have priority . &NAME 
SUBJECT: missed &NAME lecture I 'll do an extra lecture in Language &NUM on Friday next week at &NUM ( i.e. after Dialogue systems ) to make up for the one I missed yesterday . &NAME 
SUBJECT: Language &NUM practical - parsing your own questions ( OPTIONAL ! ) This is strictly optional , but if you want to parse your own example questions to look at the &NAME , here 's what you have to do : &NUM start &NAME &NUM M-x allegro ( this assumes you still have the &NAME from last term ) &NUM at the &NAME ( &NUM ) prompt ( require : climxm ) &NAME ( &NUM ) : ( load " /usr / groups / nltools / lingo / newlkb / src / general / loadup " ) &NAME ( &NUM ) : ( load-system 'mrs " ) this loads a modified &NAME &NUM &NAME &NAME &NAME &NAME complete grammar /usr / groups / nltools / lingo / erg / lkb / local-script it is important to load local-script rather than script . you will need about &NUM &NAME spare space in your ~/tmp directory for the lexicon etc ( you can always link it to local scratch if necessary ) you can then parse sentences as you did with your own grammar last term , but you will see an &NAME option on the menu that you get by clicking on the small parse tree . This displays the &NAME in a compact notation . To get the &NAME , use &NAME to Expand menu , then &NAME / Output level and choose &NAME . then everything you parse will get an &NAME &NAME in the * common-lisp * buffer of your emacs . If you want to save your own preferences , you will have to copy /usr / groups / nltools / lingo / erg / to your filespace . then load the grammar via script rather than local-script &NAME PS - I have no way of checking that I 've got all the file permissions etc right , so if you try this and it does n't work , let me know . I am sorry for the cumbersome &NAME loading procedure , but other methods require sys-admin to set things up . 
SUBJECT: Re : Practical report Mainly in response to questions from &NAME , but &NAME to everyone for info : <QUOTE> - Do you have any preference as to whether or not the code is listed in appendices ? <END_QUOTE> we 'd prefer that you do n't give code - but do make sure that your directories are readable by us when you hand-in . The exception is that if there 's some algorithm you 're especially proud of and are writing up in detail , feel free to give pseudo-code ( preferred ) or fragments of actual code to make the algorithm clear <QUOTE> - Do you have any preference as to whether single or double-sided printing is used ? <END_QUOTE> Normally double-sided , but it so happens that we 're going to have to photocopy some or all of the marked practicals this year , so anything you can do to make this easier would be appreciated . Single-sided with a binding or staple that can easily be removed would help . The same applies to the essays . Also , in response to a couple of questions , you do not have to get high &NAME to get good marks on the practical . &NAME

SUBJECT: Women - Be Careful This one is for the ladies . This is not meant to scare you but I urge you all to be especially careful where you run alone . You may have all heard in the news about the serial rapist who has just recently struck in &NAME ( his 10th attack I think ) . Unfortunately , that is uncomfortably close to &NAME . It appears he tends to attack in daylight , approaching from behind and often in wooded areas , often public footpaths close to wooded areas . He does n't seem to be put off by risk , as a number of his attacks have been close to residential areas in broad daylight . In light of this , please try and run accompanied at all times , preferably come along club sessions . If you have to run alone ( I do all the time ) , try to avoid areas where you could be vunerable . DO NOT WEAR PERSONAL STEREOS . The risk of being attacked or raped out training is very small but do n't tempt fate .

SUBJECT: A matter of pride and honour As a former &NAME captain I thought I would get the ball rolling with some words of encouragement for everyone involed with the events of this coming weekend . As everybody on this list will either be running on Saturday or coming to support the club in our quest to defeat the auld enemy , consider this directed at you . Of all the hype that surrounds the build up to the Varsity Matches , there is &NUM message that you need to understand : EVERY SINGLE RUNNER WILL COUNT TO OUR OVERALL VICTORY I am sure that anyone who has ran a few cross-country races has at times , found themselves running around a race , wondering why they are doing it and knowing that if they lose or gain a place or &NUM nobody else will really care or even notice . 2-5ths is very different to this . Every place that every runner gains will not only matter , but it wil be crucial . Even if you are the 8th man / 6th lady in the team , if you can get ahead of the last &NAME scorer , that will make an equal effect to the final team result as the person who manages to move up from 2nd to win the race . The &NUM unique aspect of the race is that you are not running for yourself , you are running for every other member of your team . Furthermore , you are running for the pride and honour of &NAME University &NAME and Hounds , as every single place will be added up at the end of the day to decide who wins the Varsity Challenge Trophy . You can do no more training . All our preparation is complete . All you can do is give everything you have on Saturday . We have all ran the &NAME course and this will give us an advantage . However , when I stood at the finish of cuppers , I did not see a single person collapse as they crossed the line exhausted . There was no vomit or blood spilt through the effort of the race . If we are to be successful on Saturday , this will have to change . Everybody will have to run the race of their life . &NAME will come here arrogant and confident after they won the Challange Trophy last year . They will want to win again . We must want to win even more . The key factor will be team spirit . You must want to run faster not for yourself , but to ensure you do not let your team mates down . Make sure you attend pre-varsity strides on Thursday and make it to you team socials in the evening and then let the &NAME ROAR carry you round The Race . That way , celebrating victory on Saturday evening will be even sweeter . Finally , this weekend will be a great sporting occasion . What makes it great is the camaraderie and competitiveness of those who take part . For many , participation in and the winning of a Varsity Match is the pinnacle of thier sporting achievement . &NAME or lose though , it will certainly be a day you never forget , so make sure you take time to enjoy it .

SUBJECT: &NAME : A matter of pride and honour Yet again &NUM cannot be running on Saturday because of injury , but I will <QUOTE> nevertheless be at &NAME all day , not just because those running value support , but because the Varsity match is a simply unique experience . I still cite my last Varsity match of &NUM years ago as being the best race of my life , but the thing I remember most about it is not my own position , but the fact that our team placed &NUM , &NUM , &NUM , &NUM , &NUM and &NUM in the race . What made that race special was not just that I ran harder than I 'd ever run before , but that every other member of the team did too , and it was because of that that we won . That year &NAME won all &NUM men 's races , and I want to see you do it again this year . Believe me , there would be few things that feel worse than crossing the line on Saturday , as &NAME cheer , victorious , knowing that you could have run better . Cross-country races can often feel like you 're running for nobody but yourself , but &NAME is different . You have been selected to run for a TEAM , and victory , when it comes , will be as much for that team as for you individually . Try and go to your team social , think about how the race will feel , know how you are going to run it , and then go out there and do it . I wish I was able to run it with you . Make sure that you earn your place , &NAME THERE IS ONLY &NUM RACE THERE IS ONLY &NUM ENEMY THERE IS ONLY &NUM VICTOR <QUOTE> As a former &NAME captain I thought I would get the ball rolling with some words of encouragement for everyone involed with the events of this coming weekend .

SUBJECT: Re : LANG-2 practical : Named Entities for extension &NUM &WEBSITE has been fixed , for those doing the named entity extension . Cheers , eh 
SUBJECT: Lang2 Practical Update There is a new version of the &NAME code available in the usual directory . It addresses &NUM issues that were brought up , and although these are not bug fixes they may help in your development . Note : You do not need to use these new files , they are simply enhancements . The new files will also work with your existing code with no change in behavior . Issue &NUM : A new method has been added called eof ( ) that allows you to test whether all sentences have been read from the file . You may use the &NAME returned from this method in place of the return value from &NAME ( ) as your loop test variable . This allows you to continue processing the file even if you get a buffer overrun ( &NAME ( ) returns false ) . If you determine that there are only a handful of very large sentences that you do n't want to accommodate with a huge buffer , you can &NAME them using this method . Note you still need the return value from &NAME ( ) to determine whether to process the &NAME or not from that sentence ( a return value of false indicates an error reading the sentence and the &NAME is not valid ) . &WEBSITE for an example of how to implement this . Issue &NUM : Some buffer overruns are due to line length overflows . These have not come up in the regular &NAME but may show up in the named entities because they are stored as &NUM sentence per line . Long sentences may overrun the maximum line length used to read the sentences . In this case , the error message would not display helpful information . I have now remedied this by moving the previous hardcoded maximum line length into a # define in the header file . Also the error message will indicate this value needs to be increased . 
SUBJECT: Lang2 Practical Named Entities The named entity files have all been regenerated as a result of some bugs that were discovered . Specifically , several anomalies were appearing in the &NAME file format that were not being handled . This caused some sentences to fail the named entity recognition and be omitted . This has now been addressed . Cheers , eh

SUBJECT: Considering doing a PhD ? Are you thinking about staying on to do a Ph.D in either the &ORG or the Department of Engineering ? It is essential if you have any leanings towards a Ph. &CHAR , or even if you just want to discuss the possibility , that you contact the relevant department approaching an individual staff member but also by making a formal application . You will need to apply to continue as a graduate student ( see &WEBSITE for details ) and use the appropriate form available from the &ORG . The Course organisers wish to point out that quite apart from your own enthusiasm and merits , there are may other relevant constraints on being accepted , notably whether there is an appropriate supervisor with spare capacity available and space , and , of course , &NAME support . The Engineering Department and &ORG receive many applications which may pre-empt supervisors , space and grants , and you should therefore make an early application , although a potential supervisor will probably not make a decision until he / she has a clear idea of your achievement on the course . The detailed administrative position about accepting you for doctoral work is also complicated by the fact that many decisions on the award of &NAME , &NAME and other grants will have been taken before you have done your project work and completed your dissertation . You cannot , therefore , rely on your dissertation as evidence of your capacity for research : you have to carry conviction to your potential doctoral supervisor before that , and of course , the examinations and coursework assessment will be taken into account . Please do not operate on the basis of inference , presumption , or &NAME gossip about the status of departments or supervisors . At least raise the matter properly with a qualified member of staff , and make a formal application using the form from the &ORG , as this will ensure that your application is seriously made and seriously treated . If you would like a copy of the current Graduate Studies &NAME and the &ORG 's " Blue Book " please see &NAME &NAME in &NAME Administration , ( FC06 ) . &ORG Student Administration &NAME &NAME Building &NAME &NAME &NAME &NAME Avenue &NAME &NAME &NAME , &NAME &NAME &NAME Telephone : &NUM ( &NUM ) &NUM &NAME : &NUM ( &NUM ) &NUM Email : &EMAIL &WEBSITE /

SUBJECT: &NAME &NAME outage : Tuesday 29th Oct , &NUM Mains power in the &NAME &NAME building will have to be switched off on Tuesday 29th October to allow new supplies to be connected to the main distribution board for the second floor works . &NAME is scheduled to go off at &NUM and to be back by &NUM , with a contingency period to &NUM . The main computer room should remain running on battery power . The inconvenience is of course regretted . At &NUM stage it seemed that we were going to be faced with &NUM separate disruptions of this nature over the next few weeks , but strenuous efforts by &NAME and others have enabled the jobs to be combined . 
SUBJECT: &NAME &NAME outage : partial reprieve Earlier in the week I announced a power outage for &NUM next Tuesday , 29th October ( with possible overrun to &NUM ) . After much discussion , it has now been decided that the work can be carried out safely with the majority of the power distribution board " live " . Only the circuits immediately adjacent to those being worked on will need to be switched off . The circuits to be switched off supply the telephone equipment ( which has battery backup ) and some of the air handling units . Thus there is likely to be some degradation in ventilation and environmental control , but all power and lighting circuits are now expected to remain on . There is a remote possibility that when the work starts it will be found necessary to switch off after all , so the time period advertised should still be regarded as vulnerable to possible disruption of supply .

SUBJECT: Re : Notice of an Election - what do Junior &NAME do ? I have been asked to explain about the Computer Science Syndicate and the role of the junior members . The Computer Science Syndicate is the &ORG 's equivalent of a Faculty Board . Broadly speaking , the Syndicate has the same powers as a Faculty Board , overseeing the running of the Department and administering its teaching . The membership consists of the Head of Department , the professors in the department , the Director of the &NAME Service , &NUM representatives of the General Board , &NUM person from Engineering and one from Maths , &NUM representatives elected by officers in the department and &NUM junior members elected by the student body . The Head of Teaching and the Secretary of the School of Technology attend as non-voting observers , the Departmental Secretary is co-opted annually and acts as Secretary to the committee , and the Deputy &NAME is co-opted unless he or she is a member in another category . The Chairman of the Computer Science Syndicate and the IT Syndicate ( the &NAME Service ) are historically the same ; the office is currently held by &NAME &NAME , the Head of Department at the &NAME Laboratory . &ORG receives the Minutes of the Staff Student Committee and the Teaching Committee , and itself reports to the General Board of the University . &ORG Minutes are sent to the Secretary General of the Faculties , the members and to Officers in the &ORG . Copies are filed in the Departmental Secretary 's office , currently Room &NAME , &NAME &NAME Building . The junior members , &NUM Tripos student and &NUM research student , attend the first part of each meeting during which unreserved business is discussed - that 's the bulk of the business and includes things like the &NAME 's annual report , accreditation matters , examiners " reports , teaching matters related to the Tripos and diploma courses , the use of calculators in exams , new proposals for courses , etc. Reserved business covers matters referring to named members of staff ( e.g. promotions and leave of absence ) , and such things as the appointment of Examiners and the Form and Conduct of examinations . The Chairman may ask for the junior members " views on any of the unreserved items , or they can address the meeting through the Chair if they have anything they want to volunteer . If a junior member has a particular concern that they think should be discussed by the Syndicate then they are welcome to talk it over with me first ; the matter can then either be included on a Syndicate agenda , or referred to another person or body . Syndicate meetings are fairly formal and reasonable dress is required ! The timetable for meetings is set a year in advanced and published in Reporter and the University Diary . There are usually &NUM dates in each academical year , but routinely &NUM or &NUM meetings will be cancelled because of lack of business . Meetings are held in the Syndicate Room ( FW11 ) in the &NAME &NAME Building at &NUM on Thursdays . There is nothing to stop someone being on both the Syndicate and the staff student cttee . The jobs do n't overlap much because the latter deals with ongoing day to day questions , suggestions and complaints - how lecture notes are distributed , such and such an exam question was too difficult - whereas the Syndicate is another step up . So if the SSCOMS raised a serious problem that needed higher level discussion , then the matter could be put to the Syndicate . &NAME that helps . &NAME &NAME Departmental Secretary and Secretary of the Computer Science Syndicate

SUBJECT: Opportunity to study and travel in &NAME - &NUM / &NUM Opportunity for &NAME students to study and travel in &NAME &NUM / &NUM The College has received an invitation to send a number of students to &NAME University of Economics for the academic year &NUM / &NUM . &NAME is a private university situated in Fukuoka , on the island of &NAME , &NAME . This is a generous offer as &NAME will provide each student with return air fare , free accommodation , &NUM hours a day of Japanese language instruction , all meals and excursions within &NAME . Students will also have the opportunity to earn money through teaching English . Please see below for a brief summary of the scheme . This offer is open to undergraduate and graduate members of the College who are due to complete their course of study and graduate this summer ( ie summer &NUM ) . The offer does not extend to students who will not graduate this summer . If you are interested in this scheme there will be an opportunity to ask the &NAME and Dr &NAME questions on Thursday &NUM January at 7.00pm in the &NAME &NAME Room . You are encouraged to attend : this is a remarkably generous offer ! Students who are selected for places at &NAME University of Economics will be expected to stay there between September &NUM and July &NUM . Selection will be made by the Tutorial Committee . Any eligible person wishing to apply for a place should send a written application to the Senior Tutor to arrive no later than &NUM noon on Wednesday &NUM &NAME &NUM . Applications should include a full cv and a personal statement , in not more than &NUM words , giving the reason why you wish to travel to &NAME and what you hope to gain from the experience . A brief summary of the scheme : * Up to &NUM students a year ( &NUM from &NAME , &NUM from &NAME &NAME &NAME &NAME ) * Air fares paid by &NAME ( details of flights and visa requirements to follow ) . However , these have to be repaid in full by the student if the student leaves the scheme before Christmas , and &NUM repaid if the student leaves before &NAME . * Accommodation provided at no cost to students in individual rooms , each with en-suite bathrooms and small but well-equipped kitchens , in the new building . * Free use of computer facilities . Computers will be installed on the top floor of the building which will be reserved for foreign students , and includes a lounge area and Sky TV ( &NAME &NAME , Premier League Football etc ) . All other facilities in the new building ( such as table tennis , billiards , karaoke ) will be available for use and free of charge . * Students eat for free in cafeterias in either the dormitory or university . * Access without charge to all university sporting / library facilities e.g. tennis courts , swimming pool , gym and students may join any sporting clubs . * Tuition in Japanese language . This is envisaged as being either &NUM or &NUM hours a day , with that amount of time again being spent by students in preparation for the following day 's lessons . This conducted by qualified teachers of Japanese . Upon completion of the course the level of students " Japanese ability will be Level &NUM of the Japanese Proficiency &NAME , which is the level demanded by London-based recruitment agencies specialising in Japanese-speaking staff . * Lectures in various aspects of Japanese culture , history , politics etc. * There will be staff fluent in both Japanese and English on hand &NUM hours a day in the event of a problem , medical or otherwise for which a Japanese-speaking person is necessary . * Trips to various places of cultural and scenic interest are also planned , but details have not been discussed yet as to destinations . These will tie in with the content of the lectures mentioned above . * For none of the above will any students incur any cost whatsoever . * &NAME to run from September to July . There is no reason why any student who wishes to stay on a little longer or arrive earlier cannot do so . It is not offically part of the scheme but worth noting that evenings will be free and work teaching English privately is readily available and quite lucrative with &NUM pounds an hour being a rock-bottom rate , and &NUM to &NUM being more common . This is English conversation , so no knowledge of Japanese is necessary , or in fact any English teaching qualifications or experience . &NUM or &NUM hours of work a week nets &NUM to &NUM hunderd pounds a month , and most students work more hours than that . In these days of student loans this will be a boon to any impecunious student , especially as no tax is payable in &NAME for &NAME citizens for the first &NUM years of residence .

SUBJECT: &CHAR and &CHAR practical Hi students , the description of the computing and the web practical will be on the C-W webpage coming Monday . &NAME 
SUBJECT: &CHAR and &CHAR practical -- a question and its answer Hi I got an email asking how the same &NAME file could be associated with both a &NAME and a &NAME &NAME schema at the same time ( without editing the &NAME file ) . The answer is that this is not technically possible -- for this practical you can comment things in and out of your files . Here 's the long answer : &NAME and &NAME &NAME are alternative schema languages , and in no real-world application would anybody have BOTH associated with the same file , as I asked you to do for this exercise . Thus , the &NAME specifications do not define an elegant syntax to connect an &NAME file to both . In the practical , you will have to comment the DOCTYPE declaration ( and for later answers , certain processing instructions ( &NAME ) in and out of the &NAME file during this exercise -- send the final &NAME file with all lines in it , but commented out , I will be able to figure out what you meant . As a reminder : &NAME validation needs a hard-wired DOCTYPE declaration in the &NAME document . Use &NAME to validate . RelaxNG validation works with the program jing -- give it the RelaxNG schema as a parameter , and comment the DOCTYPE declaration out . &NAME this clarifies things-- &NAME &NAME : &NUM small remark about what you said -- you said that if you omit the DOCTYPE declaration , your &NAME is VALID . This is not the case -- for validity you need a schema by definition ! What you probably meant is that the parser does not complain , but in the given case this only means the &NAME is WELL-FORMED -- the parser automatically switches to a well-formed parse only if it finds no DOCTYPE declaration . If there is a DOCTYPE declaration , the stakes are higher , and several things must now hold : the dtd must exist , must comply with &NAME syntax rules , and must correctly describe the structure of the &NAME instance . - ------ End of &NAME Message

SUBJECT: Re : &NAME : Language &NAME <QUOTE> Hi &NAME , I was wondering if you could please let me know where the top-docs and question files that we can use for testing our baseline system or could you please make these available ! thanks &NAME : ) &NAME , <END_QUOTE> the parsed questions ( currently best version ) are in ques-out-jan29.rmrs &NUM parsed answer files are in rmrs / ans ( namely questions &NUM and &NUM ) . This data should be enough for your immediate testing needs -- please let me know if this is not the case . We are currently working on &CHAR ) parsing all top_docs and &CHAR ) the exact rmrs 's will also change in the final version . They will contain more information , but are already syntactically correct ( cf. the corresponding dtd ) . &NAME 
SUBJECT: Re : &NAME : Language &NAME <QUOTE> I was just wondering if you could unzip the files so that we can test our programs using the documents in that folder . Unfortunately our disk quottas are so low we ca n't fit in an unzipped version of the files in our own directories and do n't have permission to unzip them into that folder ! <END_QUOTE> It makes little sense to unzip the &NUM ( example ) files now , as in the long run , the &NUM files will have to remain zipped due to limited disk space ( remember , these are the analyses of &NUM &NUM documents ! ) You 'll have to find a way to unzip them on the fly , eg. using zcat , or , if your program cannot read in from standard-input , you 'll have to put a temporary file on the /tmp of your machine . &NAME 
SUBJECT: Re : &NAME : Language &NAME Hi , we had to fix something in rmrsdump - thanks to &NAME for finding out . You have to copy the C++ classes and headers again from /usr / groups / mphil / qa03 / xmlrmrs / and recompile if you start trying things out on the big files . Sorry for inconvenience caused . - &NAME 
SUBJECT: &NAME &NUM Practical Hi students , a number of questions about the &NAME &NUM practical have accummulated . Here are the answers : &NUM The baseline system should include treatment of &NAME arguments and other information -- just word matching is not enough . &NUM The deadline for it ( you should be finished with it by Friday next week ) is just an internal deadline -- you will describe the entire system , baseline Plus extension , in your report . &NUM The eval directory should now be visible from your directory . &NAME 
SUBJECT: Re : &NAME : Language &NAME -- buffer size Hi &NAME , as &NAME found out , sentence [ &NUM ] in &NAME has &NUM bytes and is too long for the current memory buffer ( default &NUM bytes ) . So use the constructor with a buffer size : &NAME rmrs ( &NUM ) ; instead of &NAME rmrs ; and slowly upgrade this should you run into this problem again for future sentences . - &NAME 
SUBJECT: LANG-2 practical : new version of &NAME * Hi , &WEBSITE is available ( thanks to &NAME ) that deals with the buffer size problem by printing out how much space is needed in case of a buffer overrun . This will keep people from having to guess . ( &NUM was the size needed to get all the way through q1 ) . Please copy this new version from /usr / groups / mphil / xmlrmrs / xmlrmrs. * and recompile . &NAME 
SUBJECT: xmlrmrs fixed Dear students , in a version of last night 's xmlrmrs , the last sentence ws not processed to the end . &NAME built in some changes , this is &WEBSITE again and recompile . ( Then you do n't need &NAME 's workaround ) . &NAME says : &NAME this is fixed now . The behavior of the Windows stream library is slightly different then gnu and gnu was returning a fail bit set on a call to getline ( ) with a long line . &WEBSITE and xmlrmrs.h Other changes : Implemented the &NAME error handlers so we will get line number information if it detects a malformed &NAME file or &NAME . For the students : &NAME : : &NAME ( ) now takes a boolean value . If false is passed in , it will &NAME the creation of a &NAME for that sentence . This is helpful if you are analyzing a sentence , say [ &NUM ] and want to &NAME the others : A value of true is the normal behavior . This is set as default so you do not need to change your programs unless you wish to take advantage of this feature .

With google and / or researchindex as search tools , you can find virtually any recent paper on the web . To make it easier to you , each lecture note already lists the papers which are covered . As you might have found out , most of my topics are not covered in detail in juraffsky / &NAME so you have to read papers . ( I will add some useful pointers to other books in some cases , eg. Schuetze / &NAME has some good chapters ) . I assume the paper you are looking for is &NAME et &NAME 's paper .

Because you should report your system 's performance on the test data without any changes to your system , this data is deliberately held back until the very end . The difference between the system 's performance on the test data and on the seen ( development ) data -- which you should also report -- tests the generalisability of your strategies . &NAME 
SUBJECT: Re : Language practicals -- evaluation <QUOTE> <QUOTE> &NUM For evaluation , please exclude questions that are not parsed . <END_QUOTE> &NAME , does this mean that the system should provide no output for these questions , i.e : &NUM &NUM &NUM &NUM &NUM &NUM &NUM &NUM if question &NUM does not have a parse structure . <END_QUOTE> Correct , this is how you should be doing it -- &NAME is not lowered if you have no output for a given question , cf. eval.pl . &NAME

SUBJECT: Re : &NAME project workplan the workplan is good . Needs more detail for weeks &NUM . Make up some potential milestones . Separate into " overall algorithm " ' feature detection " ' feature determination " . Time for installing an off-the shelf &NAME text classifier or &NAME algorithm . Week &NUM could be half same incremental eval / improvement as in week &NUM , and half human evaluation and analysis of results . &NUM day running the experiment of asking sb ( partha ? ) to annotate sentiment shift , a day or &NUM for analysis . Automatic eval on test corpus should not take as long as a week . It 's just a guess at this point : it 's gonna change a bit anyway . I can give you detailed comments on a draft if you manage to get the draft to me &NUM days before the final deadline . This is a hard deadline -- later than that , an &NUM cannot give you comments anymore , because I am also one of the examiners . Calculate this in , with the exact date , when you write the workplan . It definitely helps the mark / report to get these comments . So it 's in your own interest to have something ready by then . I suggest to split the data into : &NUM -- annotated training data . I do n't think you want to promise you 'll do &NUM , but if you find &NAME fast , you can do it and it will improve your results . Do n't promise it though . &NUM -- unseen test data , for final eval . &NUM should be enough . &NUM -- seen development data : you can allow yourself to do searches in it , look at them , see how the current system classifies and make decisions on the basis of it , because you are allowed to look at it . Important for developmetn corpus to be reasonably large . &NAME text overall -- Possibly replace " in parallel " for " interchangably " - or is that what you meant ? &NAME &NAME when you say shifting-window technique . Define topic shift when you first use it . Annotator agreement : you with yourself after several weeks is called intra-annotator agreement . You with somebody else is called inter-annotator agreement . &NAME resend me the more detailed plan for weeks &NUM before you submit . - &NAME 
SUBJECT: Numbering on test data Are you guys okay with the data as it is ? Somebody suggested I change the numbers to &NUM . I will do that , but only if there 's sufficient interest .

Could you please send me you &NAME . Thanks . I need it for the entry material . Cheers , &NAME If you 're not &NAME &NAME ( whoose email have trouble remembering ) , I apologise - and please ignore this . If you are , however - here 's my email to you : Hey &NAME - this probably repeats much of what you 've already said , but elaborates a bit more ... It 's mainly taken from some guy who seems to have studied this a bit ... &WEBSITE pick and choose from it as you wich . &NAME It should be noted however that there is no such thing as a game only for women . &NAME efforts should be in the direction of games that appeal to both genders and utilise the female market that way rather than targetting them exclusively . To do this &NAME will try to appeal to " what women want " from games , while preserving traditional game ingrediences and avoiding to portray females as stereotypes . Among the things women want more of from games are the following : - ) Female roles ( to identify with ) - ) Females should never be portraid as sex objects ( because they are not identified with ) - ) Relationship issues , e.g. families , romance ... ( to provide emotional interest ) - ) Character interaction and development ( to provide commitment and involvment ) - ) Evolving story ( to provide commitment and involvment ) - ) Fantacy setting ( to provide escapism ) - ) Historical settings ( to provide interesting information ) - ) Logical puzzles ( to provide intellectual stimulation ) - ) Learning e.g. mythology , history , science . ( to provide intellectual stimulation ) - ) Combat should be presented only if rational and well integrated into the story ( because violence must be justified ) . - ) No difficult real-time combat in Adventure games ( as this is disliked by adventure games player regardless of gender . ) Now some stuff about indian software / games development ( you 've probably read this ) It 's from &WEBSITE The games software industry in &NAME is expected to grow to $ &NUM mill . within the next &NUM years , - hence awareness about gaming in &NAME is raised ( you need gaming-aware people to build successful games ) . hm ... reading this it seems more and more like this is the article you 've based your stuff on ... so I 'll leave it at that . and some suggestions for you to reject about the name : &NAME &NAME &NAME &NAME &NAME ( after the rocket used by the russians in ww2 ) &NAME &NAME &NAME &NAME &NAME &NAME &NAME &NAME &NAME enjoy . &NAME

The only possible option seems to be for you to get to &NAME for around &NUM o' clock . Then &NAME would meet you and take you to &NAME with &NAME and &NAME . This plan rests on the assumption that you can get the afternoon off work ... Here is the train information from &NAME : &NAME &NAME &NUM : &NUM &NAME &NAME &NUM : &NUM &NAME : &pound; &NUM ( cheap day single with &NAME railcard ) &pound; &NUM ( cheap day single ) Then perhaps on the way back your parent / I could meet you in &NAME or &NAME or somewhere ? Oh , and there also appears to be a 7-day advance saver ticket from &NAME to &NAME ( single ) for only &pound; &NUM if being in a cramped box on wheels with &NAME , &NAME , &NAME and possibly some guitars does n't appeal to you . I think it leaves &NAME at just after &NAME ish . Hope you 're having a good day and you can make it next weekend . Love &NAME &NAME , sounds ok , but then I still have to get back . I know about the cheap wol-dur tckts , but that does only cover &NUM way . Hmmm. Will have to have a think . * Try and make sure you can get off work . * See if your parents can pick you up at &NAME / &NAME on Sunday . If they ca n't then you could consider getting another single ticket back from &NAME to &NAME .

The cost will be &pound; &NUM per person . Please make cheques payable to &NAME &NAME and present them to me on Saturday .

I am quite surprisingly unbored , despite the fact that I still have no job and &NAME of my best friends have gone away for the rest of the summer . I seem to have a lot to do , and even though I 've given my name to countless places ( I do feel like I 've been a bit of a job prostitute ) , &NUM wants me . Everywhere else in the country seems to want employees , why does n't &NAME ? I am becoming increasingly desperate . I have lost lots of weight since I got to &NAME ( one of the first things my Dad always says to me is " Have n't you lost weight ? ! " . We are a bit obsessed in this house , my Mum is stick thin and does lots of exercise , my sister disappears behind lampposts , my Dad wants to lose weight [ thats what my Mum tells him , anyway ] , and then there 's me ... ) . So , anyway , I felt that I 'd lost enough to wear a bikini , so little &NAME and I went bikini shopping , I have a pale blue thing , it is not worth &NUM quid for that little material , and I think I 'll take it back anyway because when will I EVER EVER wear a bikini in &NAME ? ! It 's not exactly &NAME , is it ? So that 's my bikini story , sorry , you 're probably either embarrassed , disgusted or bored , but I have very little else to tell you , due to the dullness of &NAME and the fact that being boring is genetic ... you should meet my parents ... kidding . We had the church youth group over for a &NAME on Sunday , they are a noisy , rowdy lot and I escaped to my room with a book . I am going into &NAME tomorrow to get some sandals from &NAME , even though I ca n't afford them . I am a bit depressed because it looks like I 'll have to get a proper loan next year ( ! ! ! ) , so I am very anti-Labour at the moment . I am actually seriously thinking about going to see my &NAME ; to protest about tution fees and to give me something to do . He would be glad to see me , I 'm sure . It would make a nice change from all those old ladies moaning about water rates , anyway ( not that water rates are n't important at all ) . My sister 's 18th is soon and she is having a murder mystery party on Saturday . I am novelist and I get to wear a blonde wig . I have always wanted to be blonde ! ( to give me an excuse for behaving the way I do , you know ... ) . What can I give her for her present ( given my present cash flow situation and lack of imagination ) ?

Anyway , &NAME suggested I write to the TV licensing agency and inform them of our situation . This I will do with all due haste and fervour . Well , I 'd better go and eat something .

SUBJECT: Hi Hi &NAME , Are you still online ? ? ? &NAME 
SUBJECT: &NAME Dear &NAME , &NAME , sorry I did n't receive your latest e-mail until now . I guess I missed chatting in a chatroom . That 's a shame as it would have been great fun ! Thanks for your e-mail ! Very well , I relent You may assume I am intuitive ! However , I must point out that being male does not place me in a separate species from you . You see , I actually believe that you , too , are human . Please return this courtesy . " Airplane is a good film there are more in that genre . We will rent them next term . - My incredulity abounds . &NAME , yes I agree that Airplane is a good film ( generally ) but are there really more of the same genre ? That seems slightly far-fetched . Anyway , I would take great pleasure in renting similar videos next term . May I say that I found the opening scene absolutely hilarious , when the aeroplane was likened to a shark . Fantastically funny ! What do you mean by saying that your family liked the idea of your Christmas presents ? Are you trying to tell me they thought it was a lovely idea we all sent presents to each other , or am I getting a completely wrong idea ? 'my dad found the whole Tim-giving-us-photos-he'd-taken-himself thing quite amusing . My dad can relate to that . - Yes It was extremely nice to receive those presents from &NAME . He is extremely clever / economical . Do n't you think ? I can see why your dad might find the idea amusing . I rather think my family did too although they cannot relate to it . " Bored , watching lots of trashy TV . What you up to ? Do n't do anything I would n't do - Yes , I 'm a little bored too . It is quite lonely being at home all day with nobody to talk too except oneself and the fridge . The unpleasant idea of chemistry textbooks looming over the rest of the day is slightly depressing . What on earth can you be watching on television ? I can find nothing of much interest save " Friends on Friday evening and &NAME &NAME tomorrow . Well , I 'm trying to study as much as I can psychologically cope with , but I 'm going to be working in my dad 's bookshop on Wednesday and Friday this week . That should give me a welcome break from the hallowed halls of chemistry . I 'm going to be spending the New Year up in the Scottish Highlands &NAME , and may possibly be going skiing . Last time I skied I fell over . I was about &NUM . I did n't much care for it and have never been back since . I hope I do n't fall down this time as it would be infinitely more embarrassing ! Anyway , I am also looking forward to going on the internet much more as we are changing our &NAME to one which provides a totally free service . Incidentally , are you aware of the fact that we may quite well owe &NAME &CHAR &pound; &NUM at the beginning of next term ? &CHAR is quite disastrous really As you ought to have been aware , I began defrosting our freezer the morning you left &NAME ! ! ! ( Just kidding although watching ice melt is incredibly more exciting than the paint drying process . ) Anyway , back to the story Well , I asked &NAME downstairs if we could store our freezer contents in their freezer . She said absolutely not , promptly pulled out a revolver , and shot me right between the eyes I 'm now dead . No ! Really &NAME , you should n't believe such fantastically unrealistic tales ! Dear , dear , dear ! You 're just so gullible ! ( Just kidding ! ) Anyway , she said certainly we could , so we did . Now , that was at about 11am and the freezer did n't finish defrosting until &NAME . ( Mainly because I never bothered to turn it off whilst leaving the door open and placing large bowls of hot water inside it ! ) When I finally got around to retrieving our frozen food , &NAME had gone home ! So had &NAME ! &NAME I was deserted ! ! ! I was in dire straits , so I Well , I wonder , what could I have ( feasibly ) done ? Most likely nothing , but you may imagine something ridiculous if you like . &NAME suggested I promptly said " Oh bother ? ? ? and tripped over my own feet . I think that 's a little harsh . So , &NAME &CHAR now has about &NUM kilos of our frozen chips , along with multiple loaves of bread ! The real trouble ( yes , seriously ! ) is that &NAME happened to mention the fee for storage in their freezer was &pound; &NUM per hour . This did not concern be greatly as I assumed she was joking , and even if she had turned out to be serious , it would only have cost us about &pound; &NUM . However , now that we are utilising her storage facilities over Christmas , it would cost our flat &pound; &NUM . This would lower our flat bank account balance by about &NUM - not a healthy way to start the term ! The second little flat story which I shall tell you is probably one you have heard from &NAME or someone else . Just in case you have not I would like to make you aware of the fact that on Saturday morning &NAME and &NAME came to visit and , whilst &NAME was engaged in polite conversation with &NAME , &NAME and &CHAR ( and various parents ) &NAME was redesigning our water closet . It appeared , from subsequent ( although not very close as &NAME had just cleaned it WARNING ! &NAME ! ! ) inspection that the entire visit had been a ruse , the sole purpose of which was to maliciously " blacken the reputation of our " spotless toilet . On reflection and long consultation with &NAME and &NAME we decided that they had facilitated the effects desired by themselves by pouring something akin to the nature and properties of food colouring down our lavatory . This distressed and perplexed us greatly . We are still distressed and perplexed greatly . Sleepless nights have been our lot ever since . Seriously . I now expect you to be distressed and perplexed . Greatly . Do n't disappoint my &NAME . I 'm counting on your being perplexed . In conclusion I would like to say that I 'm not really sure whether or not I 'll do anything you would n't do . In fact , I can think of quite a few things I do which you would n't do and am not quite sure it would be advisable to refrain from doing them. ( ! ) Now &NAME , I have just written you a long e-mail . I know you are a very busy person ( quote : [ &NUM 'm] " bored ) and I am extremely grateful that you should take the time to e-mail me ( seriously , seriously , no sarcasm ) as I really enjoy reading them , but could you try and write a slightly longer &NUM next time ? If you 'd rather not or do n't have time then okay . &NAME , I probably should n't have said that ! ( I 'm not being judgmental , so please do n't plot to kill me ! ) See you , &NAME &NAME I really liked your Scottish accent on the " phone the other night . It was most convincing ! Perhaps you can write in the language of the gods also ? 
SUBJECT: Chat at 6ish Hi &NAME , &NAME ! Well We shall discuss your e-mail in marshallbees at &NUM precisely .

E-mail me if you ca n't make it and need to change the time or something . Well , see you at &NUM precisely . Oh , by the way . Perhaps you would like to download " Netscape &NAME &NAME Service sometime . I 'll give you the web-site address if you want to . You see , it enables you to chat directly i.e. a little box will appear in your computer screen . Also , its main benefit is that it lets you know when your friends are online . Anyway , see what you think . I will finish this short e-mail with the following quote from &NAME which we may choose to discuss this evening I quote from &NAME ; " I have similar characteristics to an amphibious-type creature who has evolved &NUM million years in a few hours and has mysteriously taken on the form of a large slug with uncontrollable mating habits &NAME

This was amusing , and may prove to be even more so if it turns out we knew the unknown guy . So , are you still well ? Are you still watching " Diagnosis Murder " every day ? I watched it today . I also watched it yesterday . However , I did n't get up at &NUM : 15am , tempting though it inevitably was . Today I synthesised penicillin ( on paper ) whilst yesterday I synthesised &NAME and &NAME ( on PAPER ) . Talking of Cocaine and Opium It could be quite interesting next term if some of our flat-mates came home to find a " Cocaine-laboratory set up in our kitchen . I can just imagine the scene Over the next few weeks subtle hints are dropped that &NAME is not quite the na 've chemist he makes out to be . &NUM morning when &NAME is checking the post she finds a parcel for &NAME from , say , &NAME . This is curious . She leaves it in his room and probably thinks nothing more of it , but perhaps she does Later that day she returns from her lecture to find the kitchen work-surfaces covered with complex-looking chemical apparatus containing curious tar-like substances that bubble . There are some shallow glass dishes containing a white powdery substance , just recrystalising from solution . The parcel is lying on the table , opened , and a lab-coat is strewn carelessly on the floor . The phone suddenly rings she picks it up to hear a curiously thick voice with a sinister-sounding message for &NAME . I do n't know what could happen next , but it may well be very amusing ( ! ) Anyway " I am not going to plot to kill you . Why would I make it that easy for you ?

SUBJECT: &NAME is DOOMED Hi &NAME , " &NAME - &NAME . " You talked to &NAME in some weird and unintelligible version of English ( can the Scots get NOTHING right ? ) - Evidently not . Think about it . Obviously you cannot either , hence your sentence without meaning . " &NAME was rude it 's just a good job &NAME and &NAME were n't there . - Why ? ? ? Do you see &NAME and &NAME as some ultra-moral , easy-to-offend , hyper-Christian people ? I was there , how different am I to &NAME and &NAME ? " What is this , I talked to &NAME in our own language ? - Well , I assume you did . Since &NAME and I talked for about &NUM minutes in whisper mode whilst there was nothing appearing on the main screen , we assumed you and &NAME were conversing in your own language . " I do not remember insulting you at any point . But enlighten me . - Most assuredly I shall enlighten you . You called me names . I then asked if you enjoyed insulting me and you replied with something along the lines of " have you just worked that out ? Do you remember ? " Maybe you could slip a little something into her early morning cup of tea to see exactly how hyper she can get funny ! - Very funny ! It is worth it just to imagine it . I am laughing as I type . " Maybe I could place you in a room surrounded by mess , with an unseen but audible vacuum cleaner next door - If we assume this took place in &NAME &CHAR then there could be some slight technical difficulties I would have to be placed in either yours or &NAME 's room as they are the only untidy &NUM . If I was placed in your room then it would n't work as vacuum cleaners are terrified of &NAME 's room . If I was placed in &NAME 's room then that would also be impossible because vacuum cleaners are terrified of you and they have no need ( I 'm not talking about desire here ) to go into my room . In either case , I 'm the only &NUM in the flat who understands how to switch on vacuum cleaners . " &NAME , are you coming to my house for my birthday ? I would love to see you , and you know my parents adore you . You could clean my room . &NAME boy I do n't offer everyone that privilege , you know . - Much as I would love to I 'm afraid I am taking my grandmother ( yes , the &NUM with &NUM lives ) to see &NAME on the 26th . I 'm sorry &NAME , thanks very much for inviting me though . I 've sent you a birthday card , so do n't think it 's a Christmas &NUM and open it on Monday ! Anyway , I did n't know you were going to have a party . Would I have known anyone else who will be there ? It will break my heart not to have the chance to clean your room . Oh ! Why do I always miss these life-changing experiences ? ! ? Anyway , is your room ever really messy ? I do n't think it is at &NAME , but then I 'm comparing yours with &NAME 's. " Got to go , I 'm going out for a meal with some friends ( yes , I have more than &NUM ) . - Who 's the one ? ( I 'm joking , I know you have lots and lots of friends just in case you get offended . ) I got &NUM Christmas cards today ! Actually , it was a bit embarrassing . Well how would you explain a Christmas card that was addressed to " &NAME " &NAME &NAME , on the envelope , to your parents when they give it to you ? That would have been relatively okay , but then I opened it and discovered it was from a guy &NAME - an interesting experience . It turned out my fears were unfounded as my parents did not conclude I had weird friends , just &NUM with an interesting sense of humour . Guess what was on the front of &NAME 's card . A duvet ! He is just so obsessed with duvets , especially his own . Well , I must go . Actually , I must n't, but I do n't want to bore you further by continuing to type when I really am not thinking much about what I am typing . Oh , I was for the rest of the e-mail , do n't worry , but not for this paragraph . I 'm pleased to hear you are looking forward to finishing your work at the &NAME Office . Have a wonderful Christmas , &NAME &NAME I 'm sorry about the " Hello ? e-mail . I was just wondering if you were still alive as you had n't e-mailed in a week . But then neither had &NUM , although that 's another story . 
SUBJECT: &NAME , &NAME , " Hyper-Christians ! " Hi &NAME ! " It 's nearly Christmas , and although &NAME and nicety pervades the land , it stops at our front door , so I feel free to insult you . - &NAME and nicety does not pervade this land . I do n't know anything about your front door , but that sounds highly likely . " Yes , &NAME and &NAME are hyper-Christians . ( I feel so unworthy ) . - Are you being honestly serious here ? " You are different because I do n't think you are easily shocked . At least , having a poker face , you do n't show it . - I may not be easily shocked , but that was quite an insult . Do I honestly have a poker face ? I 'm in despair . " It [ mess ] disturbs and distracts me . - That 's exactly the way I feel about mess too . " I am sorry about whispering . It was very rude , and I 'm sorry . - That 's quite alright . I was n't saying you ought n't to have . &NAME and I whispered too , as did yourself and &NAME " I am not having a party . I just invited everyone to my house knowing that most people would n't be able to come . &NAME and &NAME &NAME and &NAME are coming though . You are missing out on my favourite foods they are expensive , ha ha ha . - Oh , I see . I 'm glad some of your friends will be there for your birthday . I deeply regret missing out on your favourite foods , and the fact that they are expensive goes without saying really , does n't it ? " Happy Christmas , sweet &NAME , may your blessings be plentiful in the New Year . - Why , thank you &NAME ! Incidentally , did you know that &NAME and I now only communicate through his lawyer , a 'Mr &NAME ? Here is the last e-mail I received from him &NAME &NAME Esq. , As Mr. &NAME 's lawyer , I assure you that you are , how shall I put it in the soup . Frankly , you are a very unwise young man to have crossed my client . You have dealt in an immature manner , and will be dealt with accordingly . You may be assured that you will be sued to the full extent of the law , and will probably never see your homeland again . ( You can expect to be deported as a slave to &NAME . ) Oh yes , Mr. &NAME , you have played with fire , and now you 're going to get burned ( or burrrrrrrrned , as you would say ) . You have unfortunately messed with one of the most important personages in the country ( in the form of my client ) , and I do n't get paid &pound; &NUM an hour to fool around in other words , your life as you know it is about to be terminated . So there 's the good news Mr. &NAME . The bad news is that my people ( thugs / mercenaries some might call them ) will be round shortly to un-tuck your bed-sheet . Yes it 's true Mr. &NAME , I 'm afraid there is no easy way to break this kind of news . So , until we meet face to face ( probably in the dock ) let me wish you a happy future . &NAME , Mr. &NAME Quite interesting , do you agree ? Well , I have been wrapping Christmas presents this evening . Oh my , time flies too quickly , it 's Christmas once again . I shall now go and do some photo-manipulation .

( I feel so unworthy ) . You are different because I do n't think you are easily shocked . At least , having a poker face , you do n't show it . &NUM My room is really not that messy at all . In a mess hierarchy of the flat , you are at the top , followed by &NAME , then me , then &NAME and &NAME . I do n't really like mess . It disturbs and distracts me . &NUM I am sorry about whispering . It was very rude , and I 'm sorry . &NUM I am not having a party . I just invited everyone to my house knowing that most people would n't be able to come . &NAME and &NAME &NAME and &NAME are coming though .

Love &NAME <QUOTE> From : &NAME ( &EMAIL ) To : &EMAIL Subject : &NAME is DOOMED &NAME : &NAME , &NUM &NAME &NUM &NUM : &NUM : &NUM &NUM Hi &NAME , " &NAME - Catchy . " You talked to &NAME in some weird and unintelligible version of English ( can the Scots get NOTHING right ? ) - Evidently not . Think about it . Obviously you cannot either , hence your sentence without meaning . " &NAME was rude it 's just a good job &NAME and &NAME were n't there . - Why ? ? ? Do you see &NAME and &NAME as some ultra-moral , easy-to-offend , hyper-Christian people ? I was there , how different am I to &NAME and &NAME ? " What is this , I talked to &NAME in our own language ? - Well , I assume you did . Since &NAME and I talked for about &NUM minutes in whisper mode whilst there was nothing appearing on the main screen , we assumed you and &NAME were conversing in your own language . " I do not remember insulting you at any point . But enlighten me . - Most assuredly I shall enlighten you . You called me names . I then asked if you enjoyed insulting me and you replied with something along the lines of " have you just worked that out ? Do you remember ? 'Maybe you could slip a little something into her early morning cup of tea to see exactly how hyper she can get funny ! - Very funny ! It is worth it just to imagine it . I am laughing as I type . 'Maybe I could place you in a room surrounded by mess , with an unseen but audible vacuum cleaner next door - If we assume this took place in &NAME &CHAR then there could be some slight technical difficulties I would have to be placed in either yours or &NAME 's room as they are the only untidy &NUM . If I was placed in your room then it would n't work as vacuum cleaners are terrified of &NAME 's room . If I was placed in &NAME 's room then that would also be impossible because vacuum cleaners are terrified of you and they have no need ( I 'm not talking about desire here ) to go into my room . In either case , I 'm the only &NUM in the flat who understands how to switch on vacuum cleaners . " &NAME , are you coming to my house for my birthday ? I would love to see you , and you know my parents adore you . You could clean my room . &NAME boy I do n't offer everyone that privilege , you know . - Much as I would love to I 'm afraid I am taking my grandmother ( yes , the &NUM with &NUM lives ) to see &NAME on the 26th . I 'm sorry &NAME , thanks very much for inviting me though . I 've sent you a birthday card , so do n't think it 's a Christmas &NUM and open it on Monday ! Anyway , I did n't know you were going to have a party . Would I have known anyone else who will be there ? It will break my heart not to have the chance to clean your room . Oh ! Why do I always miss these life-changing experiences ? ! ? Anyway , is your room ever really messy ? I do n't think it is at &NAME , but then I 'm comparing yours with &NAME 's. " Got to go , I 'm going out for a meal with some friends ( yes , I have more than &NUM ) . - Who 's the one ? ( I 'm joking , I know you have lots and lots of friends just in case you get offended . ) I got &NUM Christmas cards today ! Actually , it was a bit embarrassing . Well how would you explain a Christmas card that was addressed to " &NAME " &NAME &NAME , on the envelope , to your parents when they give it to you ? That would have been relatively okay , but then I opened it and discovered it was from a guy &NAME - an interesting experience . It turned out my fears were unfounded as my parents did not conclude I had weird friends , just &NUM with an interesting sense of humour . Guess what was on the front of &NAME 's card . A duvet ! He is just so obsessed with duvets , especially his own . Well , I must go . Actually , I must n't, but I do n't want to bore you further by continuing to type when I really am not thinking much about what I am typing . Oh , I was for the rest of the e-mail , do n't worry , but not for this paragraph . I 'm pleased to hear you are looking forward to finishing your work at the &NAME Office . Have a wonderful Christmas , &NAME &NAME I 'm sorry about the " Hello ? e-mail . I was just wondering if you were still alive as you had n't e-mailed in a week .

SUBJECT: Regarding our secret love affair ... This is a long and in-depth e-mail . Please do n't read it unless you have time . Thank you . Dear &NAME , Please do n't let your mother find out about our secret love affair . ( I am not being serious , but I guess you worked that out . ) It was good to hear from you yesterday . Anyway , the tricks &NAME left for the geology department at 2pm on Tuesday . I duly went down to the &NAME Trading Company and bought a substantial quantity of grass seeds for &pound; &NUM . I had been anxious that sowing grass seeds would do lasting damage to the carpet and that I would therefore be in a rather sticky situation . Therefore , I decided to do as follows I went to the &NAME &NAME and asked the lady there if I could borrow the keys for one of my friend 's rooms as they had forgotten to turn off their storage heaters before going home . She willing obliged but asked me to bring them straight back . I then quickly returned to the flat and opened &NAME 's room , placing on the floor a bin-liner on top of which I spread a damp dish-towel , sprinkling grass seed liberally over its surface . I then watered the towel and rushed back with the keys , after hastily turning off &NAME 's heater and checking &NAME 's. The lady was most thankful . So , I did n't carry out the trick as planned , for the carpet does not belong to me . I would have had no hesitation if it was &NAME 's or mine , but it is n't. However , it should still be amusing for &NAME to return and find a patch of grass growing in his bedroom , though he had locked the door . Now , trick number &NUM Earlier that day I made my way over to &NAME &CHAR to see &NAME . He obliged by giving me the relevant details but warned me that you had better not try to sell his stereo system . Anyway , I tried to call &NAME and find out about his guitar - &NAME only knew it was a &NAME &NAME guitar , and that &NAME had got it in a sale for about &pound; &NUM . Unfortunately &NAME was n't answering . Since time was quickly marching on I could n't go to &NAME to post &NAME 's advertisement , and I had n't the necessary information from &NAME anyway . So , this trick has not yet been completed . However , I intend to go down to &NAME sometime during the holidays and I will finish it then . In any case , that will only serve to make it even less understandable for &NAME , since the phone calls are not going to begin immediately after the holidays start . Well , on Tuesday I also managed to clean most of the flat , including the shower and bathroom . I also walked to the science site to visit the library and show my friend where the &NAME department was . In addition to that I defrosted and cleaned our fridge / freezer , and also cleaned my room with the utmost thoroughness . After that I had to pack my room , and as a result of my hectic morning , after busying myself with all this running around , I had to rush frantically to the railway station . I arrived on the platform , much out of breath due to the rather weighty nature of my bags , to see the train pulling out of the station . My heart sank , as the next train was not due for at least an hour . Thankfully it was not my train , which had been delayed by the ineptitude of &NAME by &NUM minutes . This was &NUM time when I was thankful for inefficiency . Eventually my train arrived and I embarked upon my journey , sad to leave &NAME . My train was then delayed my vandalising children on the railway track . I arrived at &NAME over &NUM minutes late , but still in &NUM piece and much calmer than I had been while rushing to try and catch my train . Now , I will keep you up to date with the latest happenings in that exiting focal point of all our lives , &NAME &NAME Well , on Monday evening &NAME invited &NAME and &NAME and &NUM first year &NAME girls for dinner . The meal was most delicious , and afterwards one of the first years was given the opportunity to cut &NAME 's golden locks - a most amusing occurrence indeed . The poor unfortunate girl was halfway through the task when she accidentally cut some of &NAME 's ear off . Now , you know what &NAME is like when he gets angry about something Well actually , he did n't assault her , but he yelled and almost cursed about it for a substantial number of minutes . I think the blood contrasted beautifully with his pale complexion . So &NAME now has a mutilated ear , something he will doubtless cherish as it was done at the hands of one of his favoured girls . I wonder if we could make him think we had paid &NAME ( the unfortunate girl ) to carry out her heroic deed ? Imagine his reaction ! Anyway , are you well ? Was your trip to &NAME library beneficial ? Are you pleased to be at home and did you enjoy your night our yesterday ? When you sent your last e-mail I was in the middle of a power cut . At &NUM : &NAME I was gaily about to check my e-mail , when the computer switched off and I was plunged into darkness . We proceeded to eat our dinner by the light of oil lamps . We lit our fire and &NUM the played the piano by candlelight for half an hour . It was very beautiful , but could get boring quite easily . I then went up to my room , oil lamp in hand , and began to study . At &NAME the electricity came back on and I received your e-mail . Thank you . My next piece of uninteresting trivia is that I now have absolutely free internet access at any time of the day or night ! We have signed up to ntl , the telephone company , and that is why I am sending you this in the middle of the day . Any time you wish to chat online just let me know , as it would be fun . Also , if you want &NAME &NAME &NAME Service , it can be downloaded from the following location ... &WEBSITE o73026 &NAME is going to get it , and possibly others . It is an extremely interesting piece of software which allows you to chat easily ( via text or voice ) online . It also allows you to see whether your friends are online if you or they want . It 's fun . Well , I have written some words to you , and I hope you are well and enjoying your holidays . Write back to me soon . I look forward to hearing from you . &NAME 
SUBJECT: Regarding our next tryst ... My dearest &NAME Meet me by the willow trees beside the river tomorrow at midnight . How shall I recognise you ? Anyway That was a rather psychedelic e-mail . I hope the colours do n't represent your moods because if so then you changed from a rather girlish pink to a morbid black , then back to the same pink before becoming a very light ethereal sky blue and ending with a more stable medium blue . You ought to see a psychologist . I do n't think that counts as orifice checking , but it 's still important . I 'd just like to point out , &NAME , that biology is nothing like chemistry whatsoever . I do n't really even consider biology a science . All biologists do is draw pictures of rabbits eating carrots . Chemistry is sooooooo much more sophisticated . We explode things . I was n't worried about &NAME taking on &NAME 's characteristics , more his parents and mine . No , I 'm not going down to &NAME especially to place an advertisement in &NAME . Honestly &NAME ! I would post it if that were the case ! No , I 'm going down to see the flat . " &NAME , why are you studying &NAME ? - I 'm studying because I have an enormous amount of work to do before the exams and I want to do better than last year . I know holidays have only begun , but I 'm bored already . I did n't know you had asthma . So , you went for a run . That 's the problem with living in a city ; when you do something , people see you although they probably do n't notice . Here in the country people notice . " I am going to my friend 's house tonight to say hello and look at her new extension ( fun ) . - Extension of what ? " The time thing is very very amusing . - &NAME thing ? Do you mean &NAME 's ear ? Incidentally , due to foot and mouth , we now get our post delivered only to the end of the road , newspapers are no longer delivered , and suspicion reigns . &NAME . It 's very cold here . I envy you the warm climate of &NAME . Although , you probably do n't think it 's warm . Now , &NAME is feeling rather unwell these days , and I think I shall send her a get well card . Would you like to do the same ? &NAME 's address is &NUM &NAME Road &NAME Park &NAME &NAME 3PT He said goodbye to &NAME today , I quote 'Miss &NAME has now left , and therein lies a story : I was taking her to &NAME to drop her off with her brother , and she assumed that it would be easy enough to find the place because she knew what it was called &NAME Halls . Thus , she did not ask for directions , and upon arriving in &NAME , she realised that it was somewhat bigger than she had expected and we would perhaps not be able to just " find the place by knowing its name ! And so , &NUM people , a number of text messages and an hour later we eventually found our destination ! Anyway , she is there now and I am emailing you from my living room where &NAME is currently residing . See you later , &NAME He often calls me " o fair and wondrous &NAME strange .

I do n't know , do YOU think I have moral standards or not ? " - Do I have your permission to be " holy " ? &NAME loves us . He does n't like us the way we are , that 's why he wants to change us to be like &NAME . I 'm sure you do have moral standards . Not as strong as &NAME 's, well , perhaps just different . &NAME has the effect on me of inducing me to relax my moral standards . There is something about people with higher moral standards than your own which can be slightly suffocating . I have not discussed morals at length with you , so I ca n't say very much , except that you come across as being more concerned with being able to get alongside people in order for them to notice that you 're a Christian and talk about it in their own time , rather than being more separate from them . This is good . It is also good not to compromise your principles - that is what &NAME does . I am not saying you do , and I am not judging you - please remember this ! Out of curiosity , and as a topic for conversation , what do you think about my moral principles ? 'Daisy looks forward to the ever-closening day when she gets to know our pet a little better . " - Soon to be . " No , things are NOT moving quickly with &NAME . They are not moving anywhere at all . " - Have I struck a nerve ? &NAME , just joking . " I would not make myself an object of ridicule just for your amusement . " - &NAME I 'm disappointed . &NAME did . " Why ca n't I tell &NAME you went shopping ? Does n't he like you helping old people ? " It was on a Sunday , &NAME I like being patronising to people ! The story about &NAME and &NAME was absolutely hilarious . You made me laugh a lot . Thank you , you are very funny . " I have had my hair cut , but it does n't look great , never mind . I 'll just tie it up . " - If it 's not as bad as &NAME 's then it 's fine . " I have n't done a lot of work yet but I have been out for another run ! " - Do n't worry , you sound as if you 've done more work than &NAME , and running is good . Have you started your diet again yet ? " When are we going to connect via the internet , of course ? " - Oh , good ! Well , what about Friday evening at &NAME ? Are you free then ? Can you use &NAME instant messenger , then we do n't have to bother about chat-rooms ? It only takes &NUM minutes or so to download , and it 's wonderful . If you want the web-address , then ask me for it . Now , what do you think about the following adverts for the &NAME thing ? For &NAME &NAME , &NAME CMT-CPT .

SUBJECT: &NAME Dear &NAME , Hi ! Did you have a good time at " &NAME &NAME " ? Did you do anything interesting ? Thanks for your e-mail , which I received whilst on holiday . I had a lovely holiday in &NAME &NAME , did not see any Irish mice , and sent you a postcard . Incidentally , I know I wrote in my postcard that the &NAME Isle had no foot and mouth , and I 'd just like to make it clear that the postcard was written before the current outbreaks . &NAME 's mum is 'secretly worried that &NAME might be a drug dealer . " What do you think of &NAME 's well-thought-out cottage idea ? Well , " we could make it very cheap " ( is she hinting at a subsidy here ? ) and " we could invite LOADS of people " ( delightful ) and " or somewhere " ( as usual , an excellent grasp of specifics ) somehow sound interesting . So , about &NUM people are descending on a very cheap cottage for a week - how delightful . A lovely idea ; it might even work . I have been revising organic chemistry for a week ( this is the first time in my life I 've studied the topic , which is about a third of my degree , and I 'm pleased to say I am enjoying it and it is rather interesting ! ) . I have also been moping over the demise of &NAME and the ascendancy of &NAME . Oh dear , change again . &NAME really ought to have tried harder . The mass populace ( &NAME ) thinks she 's old and past-it . &NAME seems to have all the appeal these days . Well , today I had a lazy morning as I was tired from &NUM hours travelling yesterday - we did n't get home until &NAME last night . I then did a small amount of studying this afternoon . I am shortly going outside ( it 's very windy weather , but otherwise pleasant ) to build a step up to our house . I will be using cement for the first time in my life ! Would you like to chat online sometime ? &NAME and I may be doing so this evening at &NAME , although I have n't heard from him , so it 's doubtful . Whenever is convenient , send me an e-mail . I 'm looking forward to seeing you soon , &NAME &NAME When are you going back up to &NAME ?

SUBJECT: [ Fwd : [ Fwd : &NUM / &NUM ] ] found them ! &NAME love &NAME x &NUM &NAME ( &NAME or Mr. ) ( &NAME and Prejudice ; &NAME ) * Because he 's the ultimate . I fell in love with him when I read the book when I was &NUM , and then all over again when he looks at &NAME just so so so intensely . And then he 's basically the modern version on &NAME , and it 's just the way he looks at her . &NUM &NAME &NAME ( from the " &NAME " books by &NAME &NAME ) * There 's a big chance you wo n't have read these books because they are n't &CHAR . well known , but they are book I would love to have written . They are so beautiful and poetic , and the heroine is an author ... and &NAME is beautiful . &NUM &NAME &NAME ( The &NAME &NAME ) * He does everything for &NAME , and yet still she ultimately rejects him ... it 's so tragic and such wonderful prose . &NUM &NAME ( Much Ado About Nothing ) * I think because I am very like &NAME , and would like to find my own &NAME &NUM day ; someone quite like me ! ( And because my &NAME 's name was &NAME , so I feel I have some connection ) . &NUM &NAME &NAME ( The &NAME &NAME Affair ) * It 's the money and the pinstripe suits ( mmm , men in suits ) ; o my word , he 's eminently fanciable . He has everything except me ! &NUM &NAME ( &NAME &NAME &NAME ) * He 's had so much practice ; and he 's so considerate and caring about what his women want . &NUM Captain &NAME &NAME ( The Sound of Music ) * Again , it 's the way he looks at &NAME when he realises he 's in love with her . He 's fine ! ( But maybe without the children ) . &NUM &NAME &NAME ( &NAME &NAME ) ( Yes , I do know that he was &NAME ) * I think because he epitomises the decadence of the pre-war period that I 'm in love with . I would love to have lived in that way in those decades ; so carefree and spirited and hazy , doing what you wanted all day , all those English traditions and repressed emotions , those magnificent low-waisted dresses and cloche hats . The threat of war looming near , yet the First World War seems almost romantic in a way , with men dying poetically on the mist-filled battlefields ... I wish I had lived then . &NUM &NAME &NAME ( The &NAME &NAME ) * Now this is the soppy of all soppy books ! But I read it when I was &NUM and I love it still . The period ( Georgian ) appeals to me too . &NUM &NAME or &NAME ... ca n't quite decide which ( I Capture the &NAME ) * But only really because I want to be &NAME &NAME , the narrator , because she knows what it is to be in unrequited love , and the last few paragraphs of the book are so hopeless , yet so hoping and beautiful . ( &NUM . &NAME &NAME 's cop in LA &NAME ) * &NAME !

SUBJECT: a message from &NAME ... Dear &NAME , I guess you 're at home now . Am I good at guessing ? I 've just come back from the Cathedral tower with &NAME , &NAME and &NAME . It was lovely , but very tiring since we climbed the &NUM steps in less than &NUM minutes . &NAME and I are going downstairs to have tea with &NAME at 6: &NUM . I 'm really glad you said goodbye , since I was half-worried that you would n't, as you sometimes have done . Anyway , I hope you had a good journey home and are enjoying being there again . Thanks ever so much for asking me to come and see you sometime in the holidays ; I would really like that . Sorry I was n't in too good a mood this morning . I was feeling a little depressed and emotional , since &NAME and I had " issues which we discussed " , for want of a better description . Oh dear , well , such is life . It would be dull if everything was perfect . I 'm deluding myself ; it would be wonderful . Sorry for going on so ! I hope you have a lovely week - when do you start your church job ? I think I 'm going to be quite bored and lonely next week , here all on my own , so please feel free to telephone me if you want too . Very best wishes , &NAME &NAME Did you mean to leave the apron and tea towels ?

SUBJECT: a message to &NAME Dear &NAME , Thank you so much for your e-mail ; it was really lovely . " I have always said good-bye to you , have n't I ? Sorry if I have n't ... I guess I am funny sometimes ( in a way that is n't amusing , I mean ) . " - Yes , you are funny sometimes , and , as &NAME said to &NAME and I at the beginning of the flat year when we were getting annoyed with your " funny " behaviour - " Guys , she 's good for you . " Oh , but do n't feel bad ; as I think I may have mentioned before , I 'm really glad I shared a flat with you . We have all been moody at some time or another , and personally , your moods are slightly amusing ( though only slightly ! ) . " What were your issues with &NAME ? you do n't have to tell me ... sorry , just being nosy . " - Of course I 'll tell you . Do you really think I would have mentioned it at all if I did n't want to tell you ? I prefer to see you as being interested , not nosy . Thank you for being interested . Well , on Friday evening after dinner , &NAME and I were looking at the flat accounts . I pointed out to him some entries , and he found some other entries . The entries were as follows ... ( &NUM ) The fact that the rope was bought out of the flat account , ( &NUM ) The meal you and I had at &NAME &NAME that night &NAME was cooking , ( &NUM ) The fact that we had bought " The &NAME " out of the flat account this term . &NAME was very cold towards me for the rest of the evening , and I was upset . Suffice it to say that I did not enjoy the &NAME that night . At lunchtime on Saturday I asked &NAME if he had been annoyed with me yesterday . He said he was annoyed , betrayed , hurt , etc. We had a long and painful discussion about the whole thing . I told &NAME I did n't realise he did n't want " The &NAME " to be bought out of the flat account and he seemed to find this difficult to believe , but accepted it , I think . The rope , I said was intended as a joke and I would be quite happy to pay back , since I had intended to mention it anyway . The meal , well , I think that upset &NAME the most . He said he felt that since he was very careful about his money , when I spent it like that he felt hurt . He said he did n't realise the flat account would be used like this otherwise he would have felt quite differently about it . I said that money was n't important and we had all spent other people 's money , i.e. reading week etc. The entire conversation was very very very slow and drawn out . We never once laughed or smiled . I apologised for all &NUM counts and asked &NAME what he would like me to do . He said he would appreciate me paying for the items , and said he would forgive me , as best he could . He then said that it might take him a while and that his manner towards me over the next while might well be coloured by it . What I felt , but did n't say , was that the entire thing was blown out of all proportion and that it was very petty . Perhaps &NAME reacted in the way he did because he is muddled up after splitting with &NAME . I do n't know , but I was very surprised at his ability to seemingly hold a grudge , as I have always thought and been told that he did n't do that for any longer than a very short time . I now regret eating that meal , but only because it caused all this trouble . Unfortunately I ca n't feel much remorse for the act itself , although I am trying . I do feel quite bad for upsetting &NAME and hurting him . Oh , it 's horrible . Thank you for listening . I 'm sorry for foisting this upon your eyes , and I hope you do n't mind too much . " It seems funny when you describe your behaviour as emotional ... but do n't worry , I know you are ! " - I think I find it very hard to show my emotions when with company . However , I certainly have them , as I have discovered this year . They make life very up and down . I wonder why I never used to be bothered by them ? I did not enjoy being the only person in either &NAME &CHAR or &CHAR last night , and I dreaded living on my own in the future . Thankfully , I do n't feel as bad this morning though ! &NAME ! Now perhaps I can write something less mournful . I 'm in the library this morning , about to start researching for my dissertation . Yesterday I said good bye to &NAME and later &NAME . Our phone was cut off , so I only have my mobile . We had our flat inspection yesterday morning , and the domestic manager said she had never seen such clean flooring in the kitchen ! However , se wanted me to have another go at the oven and clean the bathroom windows with glass cleaner ! She was VERY thorough ! She and the bursar were full of praise for our flat in general and said they should have had a competition for the cleanest flat . &NAME says ours would win . I have a feeling they might still have that competition ... Anyway , it does n't sound as if you 're too busy , so I hope you 're enjoying yourself . You deserve it since you worked very hard this term . You may say you did n't and just spent your day idling in the library , but you certainly appeared to be working hard and that is quite a feat in itself . Is your sister home yet , or are you alone with your parents ? In reference to the letter " covered with hearts and stuff " for my mother to find ... Hmmm . Obviously I 'd like a letter , although not covered with hearts and stuff , and if that was the case certainly not for my mother to find . Thank you fr the tea towels etc. Did you mean to leave your iron ? E-mail me soon ! ( And I shall not wallow in myself and &NAME 's issues any longer ! ) Very best wishes , &NAME &NAME I object to the greeting at the top of your e-mail . I detest sugar puffs .

SUBJECT: another message to &NAME Dear &NAME , " What do you mean you were complaining about my behaviour ? I am the model of exemplary decorum kind of but what did &NAME mean by 'she 's good for you " ? like I 'm some unpleasant tonic . I 'm almost offended . &NAME of . " - Please , please , do n't be offended with me . You 're a very pleasant tonic . I think that &NAME and &CHAR ( well , &NUM cannot speak for &NAME ) were slightly irritated at the way you seem to sometimes behave as though you are on the fastest and best roller-coaster at &NAME towers . I mean that sometimes ( most of the time ) you are absolutely lovely , and then ( and I think this annoys &NAME more ) you might seem to ignore someone . I think &NAME thought it would help broaden our experience of people to live with you - or something like that . It might improve our tolerance of people who are not always the way we would like them to be . Another example would be the way I very often had to bite my tongue this year to stop myself flaring up at &NAME when he annoyed me . I succeeded , for the most part . However , you were not nearly so much of a trial , and I hope you will not be offended with me , because I like you and there is nothing at all amiss with your decorum in the normal sense . " Well I do n't know . That does n't sound like &NAME at all " - Well , it did look like &NAME . It also sounded like him . It might have been a very clever gag by &NAME &CHAR , but I am doubtful of their aptitude in the fields of either holographic projection or advanced cybernetics . " I have sent &NAME an email apologising and saying that you and I are both equally to blame for &NUM things , and that you , &NAME and I are to blame for times-gate . " - Thank you very much . " Times-gate " ? As in " Water-gate " ? I have put the items on your bill and you can take as long as you like to pay it off . " &NAME is not yet home ; she arrives on Thursday . I am going to &NAME tomorrow to go on the eye and go to see a play , so I will not be able to send you an email tomorrow unless something goes drastically wrong but I will on Thursday , promise !

" I will be online , hotmail wise on Thursday eve , so we could have a chat if you email me a time- maybe 7ish ? I 'll look fairly early so you can go down to college .

I tried to download the hotmail messenger thing yesterday but the ITS service would n't let me , so would you mind using the &NAME &NAME thing that you downloaded earlier in the year ? It 's the product that the ITS uses and therefore I will be able to access it . I 'm looking forward to chatting to you this evening . I hope you have a lovely day . Is it very hot in &NAME ?

SUBJECT: Greetings Dear &NAME , Hello ! It was nice to talk to you last night . I hope you did n't mind me going , but I was very very tired as I had been up since &NUM : &NUM a.m. As you know , I arrived back from &NAME camp yesterday . &NUM intense week of abseiling , go-karting , mountain biking , sport , activities , bible study , prayer , music and meetings . Oh , and yes , there were &NUM &NUM and &NUM year olds as well . Children say the most curious things . I think my &NUM favourites from this week were " are we allowed to get the dinner plates dirty when we eat ? " and 'do you have to sign a form to become a Christian ? " Joking aside though , I enjoyed myself and was immensely relieved not to be sharing a dorm with children this time . Consequently I enjoyed a much more respectable &NUM or &NUM hours sleep each night . ( Well , most nights . ) &NAME importantly , one of the children made a commitment to &NAME , which was wonderful . This afternoon I 've been with my family to &NAME - a nearby country house . It is very warm today and I like it . We had quite a good week , weather wise , for the camp . Tomorrow morning I begin my new job for &NUM weeks . I will be working from &NUM o' clock until &NUM in the lab , and I am quite looking forward to it although I hope it will not be too boring . Sorry I never sent you a postcard , but I did n't really get a chance to buy one . Do you mind ? Anyway , I think the one you sent me more than made up for my lack of imagination . Well , what are you doing for the remainder of the holidays ? Are you still being a caretaker ? Do email soon . Very best wishes , &NAME

SUBJECT: Possibly some help , perhaps not ... Dear &NAME , It was lovely to chat to you , and thanks for the e-card once more . It really is very nice .

SUBJECT: ( MESSAGE ) ( DATE ) &NAME , &NUM &NAME &NUM &NUM : &NUM : &NUM &NUM ( &NUM ) ( MESSAGE_BODY ) Dear &NAME , 'Dear babe ( you do kinda remind me of the pig ... ) " - I shall try to take that in the nicest possible sense . " Thanks for your help ; sorry it was n't more of a proper conversation ! " - You 're quite welcome . Is the confusion tactic having any success ? I 'm sure the scroll-list thing will not be endless , and that if you type in enough false passwords , your one will eventually not appear . " I do n't think I am going to have time this hol to come visit , unfortunately , but next summer I definitely will unless I 've offended you irreparably ( likely ) . " - Oh good ! I look forward to that . Of course you have n't offended me ! Why would you think that ? Do you think I 'm easily offended ? " We have a new car . It 's big . " - Very nice . What type is it ? Is it blue ? We 're thinking of getting a new car in a week 's time too . Well , I 've had not too bad a day today . I managed to escape working tomorrow which is wonderful as I can sleep . Next weekend I 'm going to &NAME for my cousin 's wedding , so that shall mean more time off work ! This evening I 've done some chemistry and am going to watch " Friends " in &NUM minutes . Have you heard from &NAME lately ? I have n't. Do you think she 's offended by that text message I sent her when we were in the tram travelling back from &NAME ? Apparently she 's on another camp this weekend . Are you well ? What are you doing this weekend ? &NAME seems to pass very quickly and meaninglessly when one is quite busy . See you soon , love &NAME ( still debating on the babe-pig thing ) 
SUBJECT: Your Cyberstalker " little truffler " ? ? ? " Was just about to speak to you when you disappeared . " - Oh , you were too slow . Sorry . 'Some random guy emailed me and said that he had just moved here and wanted to meet people and he " noticed I went to school here " , how would he get this info ? And is he a creep ? And do I have a cyberstalker ? " - I would say he definitely must be a creep . All the evidence points to that . Seriously , though , perhaps someone is playing a practical joke on you . If not , then it is quite probable that he ( or she ) could find out such details about you . I do n't know how , but it is possible . As to having a cyberstalker again , an exciting possibility . Are you happy ? What film did you go and see ? Bye , &NAME 
SUBJECT: ? iso-8859-1 ? &CHAR ? Boredom3F ? Dear &NAME , Thanks very much for your e-mail . It was really good to chat to you last night , and sorry for being in rather a depressed mood at first - if you noticed . Anyway , I am happier today and have just got home from work . Why are you so bored ? Are you looking forward to seeing &NAME ? I look forward to receiving your pictures of &NAME . Do you still want to know about &NAME 's idea for a practical joke ? Well , if you do then please do n't tell anyone , especially him . His parents recently bought a new remote control doorbell , which can be activated from up to &NUM meters away . Such an item would produce much scope &NAME suggested both placing it in someone 's room at night , and also in a lecture theatre in someone 's bag . I prefer the lecture theatre idea , but it is much more risky . &NAME , it might be interesting if he did that . Anyway , &NAME 's brother 's username file still has not been created . I realised I could connect to the &NAME undergraduate server and find out , but it is not there yet . We must wait Hope you become less bored soon . Say hi to &NAME for me if you remember , &NAME 
SUBJECT: Rather difficult to categorise . Dear &NAME , " I forget whether it 's my turn or yours , but it 's probably mine . " - So now it must be mine . I wish I was coming this weekend too . I enjoyed chatting to you a few evenings ago . Did you 'shop till you dropped " in &NAME ? How did your sister enjoy &NAME ? So are you still enjoying having &NAME to stay ? Say hi to her from me . What have you been up to this week ? Today I have been at work etc. , etc. , rather boring stuff . This evening I finished all the chemistry I 'm doing this summer ! ! ! I am very happy ! Now I can write emails Actually , I 'm sure I have other things to do as well . I am getting a nasty cold at the moment and I am enjoying sneezing . ( Well , it 's such an unusual experience , and it is rather pleasant . ) I put my virus down to my colleagues at work . They are all rather ill too at present . This is what comes when one integrates with society - I should never have left the house . Actually , I should never have stopped drinking cactus juice something to take up again . Here in &NAME the natives are gathering round their fires , plotting something wicked I 'll be bound . You can hear them at nights wailing and moaning softly to each other . Some say it 's just the wind passing through the trees , but I 'm a chemist and therefore must know better . I fear they shall never let me return to &NAME . Perhaps the southern redheaded one could use his influence on them . They are in awe of his powers of talking for hours about rocks . Strange folk , the Scottish barbarians . &NAME , only &NUM weeks of the summer holidays left . Are you yearning to be back in &NAME ? I 'm not sure if I 'm looking forward to it . It 's rather funny , but most of the summer I miss being in &NAME with my friends , but then for usually about the last week or so I miss being at home with my family . Surely it does n't take me that long to readjust ? Oh dear , oh dear . I want a moose 's head . I wonder if &NAME brought one back from &NAME . He did say he would , but that was a year or more ago . Such a charming object , a moose 's head , do n't you think ? So delightful , so imposing , so furry . I 'm sure &NAME would like one . Well , I seem to have written some rather ridiculous nonsense this evening . Never mind , I 'm happy with my chemistry . Perhaps that 's the reason ; perhaps it 's the moon . Perhaps it 's because I have n't done the &NAME &NUM crossword today and my brain has to do something with it 's excess neural energy . Perhaps that 's the most ridiculous thing I 've every thought up . I do n't know ! Have a lovely day tomorrow , whatever you and &NAME are doing , and do enjoy the weekend . I hope we can chat sometime soon . Very best wishes , Love &NAME

However , I will still try and help you , although I must ask you to retract your accusation that I am best friends with a computer .

SUBJECT: Poetry Dear &NAME , &NAME , I have n't heard that variety before . Anyway , of course I realise your verse is far superior to &NAME 's. I however , being the tender-hearted barbarian that I am , did not want to hurt her feelings after the valiant attempt at poetry which she made .

SUBJECT: Re : &NAME 's Birthday You 're very funny . Thank you . Love &NAME " &NAME &NAME " wrote : <QUOTE> &NAME , Friends of &NAME , and &NAME . &NAME will soon be reaching the illustrious age of &NUM ( on the 26th of November , for those of you reaching for your diaries ) , and it has been suggested that we celebrate this by going out for a meal . Realistically but unfortunately , the only evening possible that is even vaguely near &NAME 's actual birthday , is the Monday itself . This is a problem for all die-hard &NAME fans , and those on the Ballroom &NAME &NAME . However , if we go to &NAME 's for &NAME &NAME ( it 's just a name , &NAME , I 'm not promising any drastic mood enlightenments ) , we could book for &NUM 30ish which would leave plenty of time for those wanting to get back for &NAME . The rest of us ( or possibly just me and &NAME , if people do n't want to miss the &NAME I double act ) could then go on to elsewhere ( to be decided later ) . If everyone could let me know asap , as I can then either book the meal or have a mad think about another date , that would be great . If I have n't heard from you by next Tuesday , I 'll assume you 're not coming . Unlike most other birthday invitations , this one will not be containing the usual " if I 've forgotton anyone , please forward this email to them " . &NAME does n't really like many people ( &NAME 's only invited on sufferance ) .

I thought you 'd just been clothes shopping - on the internet ? " Today I have sent off my thing to national savings which will enable me to redeem the money my parents have saved for me , I have done washing , I have changed my bed , had coffee with &NAME who amended my &NAME so that it now blatantly lies about how good I am at things . " - &NAME , do you have a national savings account ? I do too - but I suppose that 's not surprising . You did your washing - I miss doing my washing &NAME 's are never supposed to be an accurate reflection - of course they 're meant to exaggerate . " I have done no work . I do n't care . " - Is n't it strange that one never gets lots of work done on the same day as one 's friends . I found that last year in the flat with &NAME - he often told me he 'd done &NUM hours work , and I 'd done the crossword . Anyway , I got lots of work done yesterday - but not to be too annoying , it did n't really get me anywhere and I 'm still stuck even though I did n't stop " till &NAME . Oh dear ! " He [ &NAME &NAME ] said his new shoes were " nice and waterproof " and I said he sounded like &NAME . He said that he was aware that this was not a compliment . I did not mean it as an insult . He also said that I was very sarcastic . Am I too sarcastic ? " - No , no , no , of course not . You have a very nice level of sarcasm . It 's part of your personality . A non-sarcastic &NAME would be a very peculiar creature indeed . And I like sarcasm . " &NAME , my friend &NAME in &NAME &NAME wants to know how you are . " - Oh , that 's nice . Please tell her I 'm much better thank you and I hope she is well too and anything else you can think of . ( That 's the one I met when I was at your house is n't it ? ) " Love you both , in varying relationships . &NAME xx " - Just what on earth is that supposed to mean ? ? ? That can be taken in many different ways . Love you both , in the same relationship . &NAME ( I know that sounds bad , but you know what I mean . Anyway , it 's no worse than &NAME 's. )

SUBJECT: ( no subject ) Dear &NAME , &NAME , well , I 'll start by apologising for the message I sent you- it was fairly nasty and I 'm sorry for the way in which I said things . But I wo n't apologise for the content , because it was true . Firstly , &NAME asked me some days ago whether I would be able to come to a meal on the Wednesday . I told her about college group and said that I could n't, so you all knew that I would n't be able to , and to be included in any kind of invitation list was just patronising . Secondly , had I been arranging the meal , I would have made some kind of effort to re-arrange had one of you not been able to make it- to not even try is basically just saying that you 're not bothered whether I 'm there or not , which is not nice . Thirdly , to say that you 'do n't understand " what &NAME and I were trying to say reads like this : " &NAME ca n't come to the meal , but I do n't want to take responsibility for her being hurt , so I 'll pretend I do n't know what 's going on " . I ca n't help wondering whether , had it been say , &NAME or &NAME who could n't have gone , whether you and &NAME would have made more of an effort to reschedule . I 'm sorry if this seems harsh , but I 'm just trying to be honest . I know you were upset by the email I sent you , but &NAME , if you do n't tell me , I ca n't even begin to respond . I mean , the ball was firmly in your court , to be honest- and what is friendship without honesty ? If you have a problem with something I do or say , you have to tell me . I know you 're shy , but ( and I 'm sorry to be blunt ) you 're going to have to make the effort . The only reason I can see for you not making any effort to talk to me about this is if you 're not bothered whether you 're friends with me or not . If this is the case , there 's nothing I can do to change your mind and I wo n't bother you ever again . But that would sadden me , because I do enjoy your company and I like spending time with you . But- and this is a big but- I WO N'T have a one-sided friendship where I have to make every effort to see you , to apologise , to forgive first . If you wo n't make any effort with this , &NAME , there 's nothing I can do ; but I 'm not going to sit by and let your stubborness spoil your friendships . Either we are honest with each other , and we tell each other when the other has done something " wrong " , and I try and get over my pride and you your shyness , or we are n't friends ; because I hate unreal friendships . I WANT you to be honest with me , and I will be with you . If you do n't reply to this email , I 'll know that you do n't want to be friends with me . If you do , let me know when you 're free , and we can meet up and talk about this , or just reply by email ... but only if honesty is on the agenda . I think you 'll probably be really annoyed when you read this , but take a few minutes to think over what I 've said- and I 've only said it because ( &CHAR ) I want to be honest with you and ( &CHAR ) I care about you and want you to be happy and fulfilled in your friendships . Just tell me what you think- say anything ! I do want to see you ... and I guess I 'll know by tomorrow whether you feel the same . With love , &NAME x

But I wo n't apologise for the content , because it was true . " - Thank you . I found it very hurtful and have n't been thinking of much else since . Your email basically accused &NAME and &NUM of not caring about you or your feelings , suggested you did n't want to have anything more to do with us , and was dripping with sarcasm . &NAME . The point in having the meal was because the &NAME 's President 's &NAME was on Wednesday . The invitation was open to anyone on the list , and you were n't the only one who could n't make it .

" - It was not patronising . &NAME had cell group at &NUM : &NUM but she still came . When did your college group start ? Since you would n't discuss trying to work around the issue we simply made the meal as early as we could ( to the discomfort of some others I might add ) in the hope that you would be able to attend . 'Secondly , had I been arranging the meal , I would have made some kind of effort to re-arrange had one of you not been able to make it - to not even try is basically just saying that you 're not bothered whether I 'm there or not , which is not nice . " - As I have already mentioned , if people could n't make it then that 's a shame but the meal was on Wednesday for a particular reason . As I have also mentioned , we did make " some kind of effort " to rearrange the meal as best we could within the framework of the reason for the meal . " Thirdly , to say that you " do n't understand " what &NAME and I were trying to say reads like this : " &NAME ca n't come to the meal , but I do n't want to take responsibility for her being hurt , so I 'll pretend I do n't know what 's going on '' - Perhaps you overestimate my intelligence . I received rather cryptic replies from both you and &NAME . Neither of you stated your intentions clearly . For example , your reply to the first email was " enjoy " - very informative . " I ca n't help wondering whether , had it been say , &NAME or &NAME who could n't have gone , whether you and &NAME would have made more of an effort to reschedule . " - And I ca n't help saying that it would have made no difference to our " efforts to reschedule " whatsoever . You will only be able to come close to understanding our point of view when you realise that the meal was not primarily arranged for a social reason , but for a practical one . " I 'm sorry if this seems harsh , but I 'm just trying to be honest . I know you were upset by the email I sent you , but &NAME , if you do n't tell me , I ca n't even begin to respond . " - How do you know ? " I mean , the ball was firmly in your court , to be honest - and what is friendship without honesty ? If you have a problem with something I do or say , you have to tell me . " - It has nothing to do with honesty . The reason I did not respond to your email was because I generally prefer not to lose my temper if I can help it . I would have regretted it . I am regretting writing this now - but what choice do I have since you basically said reply or we wo n't be friends . " I WO N'T have a one-sided friendship where I have to make every effort to see you , to apologise , to forgive first . If you wo n't make any effort with this , &NAME , there 's nothing I can do ; but I 'm not going to sit by and let your stubbornness spoil your friendships . " - &NAME . Whenever I suggest we meet up to see each other I get the usual " I 'm so busy with work and seeing people and doing this and that . My life is just so busy , I 'll have to see if there 's a space in my diary " Do you know what that says to me ? It says " I really do n't have time to see you . It 's a matter of priorities . " As I have explained , it is n't stubbornness on my part , it 's a different approach to possible conflicts . " Either we are honest with each other , and we tell each other when the other has done something " wrong " , and I try and get over my pride and you your shyness , or we are n't friends ; because I hate unreal friendships . I WANT you to be honest with me , and I will be with you . " - It would seem you already have acknowledged that you knew I was hurt by your email , so I 'm sure you were aware I thought you had done something " wrong " . As I have explained before , it 's nothing to do with shyness . I 'm shy around people I do n't know - not with my friends . " If you do n't reply to this email , I 'll know that you do n't want to be friends with me . If you do , let me know when you 're free , and we can meet up and talk about this , or just reply by email ... but only if honesty is on the agenda . " - &NAME , the blackmail part Sorry . I want to talk to you about this . I 'm free all the time . Just come to my room and if I 'm not there text me and I 'll be there as soon as I can . " I think you 'll probably be really annoyed when you read this . " - No , I was very pleased . It made a change from the last email you sent me which must be good . I really like you and want to be friends . That 's why I was so upset by your email . Love &NAME &NAME Please do n't be too upset at all the horrible things I 've said to you in this email . You may call it honesty , but I feel awful about sending it to you .

I know you were upset by the email I sent you , but &NAME , if you do n't tell me , I ca n't even begin to respond . " - How do you know ? * * It became apparent to me . Plus , in some ways , I am psychic and I already knew . " I mean , the ball was firmly in your court , to be honest - and what is friendship without honesty ?

And remember as well that virtually &NUM has come to visit me this term- heaven forbid that they should have to walk for &NUM minutes , or make some kind of effort . I do try , &NAME , but making an effort to see you ALL when it 's kind of unreciprocated sometimes takes it 's toll ... and you 're not usually the one who I do n't see because of that . If you like , we can meet up regularly once a week , or twice , or whatever , I do n't mind .

" Either we are honest with each other , and we tell each other when the other has done something " wrong " , and I try and get over my pride and you your shyness , or we are n't friends ; because I hate unreal friendships . I WANT you to be honest with me , and I will be with you . " - It would seem you already have acknowledged that you knew I was hurt by your email , so I 'm sure you were aware I thought you had done something " wrong " . As I have explained before , it 's nothing to do with shyness . I 'm shy around people I do n't know - not with my friends . * * &NAME , &NUM kind of disagree , especially if we 're in a big group . Sometimes you barely say anything at all . " If you do n't reply to this email , I 'll know that you do n't want to be friends with me . If you do , let me know when you 're free , and we can meet up and talk about this , or just reply by email ... but only if honesty is on the agenda . " - &NAME , the blackmail part Sorry . I want to talk to you about this . I 'm free all the time . Just come to my room and if I 'm not there text me and I 'll be there as soon as I can . * * It was n't meant to be blackmail , &NAME ... I did n't think of it like that . I just wanted you to tell me how you felt , and on past experience , I thought you probably would n't, that 's all . And yes , I will come and see you in your room . " I think you 'll probably be really annoyed when you read this . " - No , I was very pleased . It made a change from the last email you sent me which must be good . * * &NAME <END_QUOTE> I really like you and want to be friends . That 's why I was so upset by <QUOTE> your email . * * Yes , ok , I 'm sorry I upset you , but do try and stand in my shoes and see this from my P.O.V. for a &NAME . You hurt me too , and I have told you why and apologised . Love &NAME &NAME Please do n't be too upset at all the horrible things I 've said to you in this email . You may call it honesty , but I feel awful about sending it to you . * * I 'm not upset , I 'm glad that you replied and that you were honest with me . I would rather you were sarcastic and nasty and angry than you said nothing at all ( thought that 's when you say it best ... just kidding ! ) . Do n't feel too bad , although if it would make you feel better , I could say some horrid stuff back ? ! Kidding ... I think what I really want to end by saying is that you 're a sweetie , and I hope you can forgive my hot temper . I have been regretting that email . But at the same time , it 's part of me and I ca n't change that . So do n't take what I say to heart ( do n't take me seriously , for heaven 's sake ! ) , and always remember your pinch of salt ... <END_QUOTE> 
SUBJECT: ( no subject ) &NAME , have you not checked your emails today yet , or are you totally and utterly offended with me and so are not talking to me , or are you expecting me to come and see you ? Please bear in mind that , thought I do want to see you , I must finish my essay this weekend and that that will involve spending most of my time in the library . &NAME and I are having breakfast on Saturday after she has stayed over , and then I am going to church twice on Sunday , but that 's it . If you can come up to the library , we could have a coffee break &NUM day , but I ca n't lose much time . It 's NOT that I do n't want to see you , but I 'm not seeing anyone else and my work has to come first . I hope you can understand that . Maybe see you this weekend , hope so ! &NAME x 
SUBJECT: Re : ( no subject ) Dear &NAME , " Umm , have you not checked your emails today yet , or are you totally and utterly offended with me and so are not talking to me , or are you expecting me to come and see you ? " - Yes , I 've checked my email . No , I thought I had already made it clear that I 'm not offended with you . Yes , I was kind of expecting you to come and see me since you said yesterday " yes , I will come and see you in your room " . It would have been greatly appreciated if you had let me know you were not able to come in the near future . Anyway , since that is indeed the case I will reply to your email ... * No , let 's not leave &NAME out of this . It is as much to do with her as it is with you or I and she has been feeling very hurt as a result of the situation . In any case , she is not well . At the risk of telling you what to do ; if you have not already done so I suggest you contact her and discuss it . * I 'm sorry , but I thought you knew the reason for the meal was because of the President 's Formal . I assumed you and &NAME communicated . Also , not being in &NAME 's is no excuse for ignorance . I only found out from my friends , not through any official channels , and as you know all my friends you had the same probability of finding out as I did . You ca n't argue with logic . * No one told me you could n't come to the meal . " It does have to do with honesty , &NAME , because in the past if you have been upset about something , you have n't said anything . And you do need to tell me , even if it 's a horribly sarcastic email . I do n't care if you lose your temper . Yell at me . That 's what I 'm here for . Sort of ... " - Oh , wo n't coffee tomorrow be fun . " And remember as well that virtually &NUM has come to visit me this term - heaven forbid that they should have to walk for &NUM minutes , or make some kind of effort . " - Oh , sorry , but I 've kind of been occupied elsewhere . I would be happy to visit you at your house but obviously I 'm not going to walk all the way there only to find you 're not in. It will have to be arranged . See you tomorrow at &NUM : &NUM pm on level &NUM of the library . &NAME

SUBJECT: Re : Dear &NAME , &NAME , sorry , sorry , sorry ... Please forgive me - I get easily irritated about people not being on time / forgeting appointments etc. " It certainly does n't sound like you want to see me . " - This may seem like strange logic , but if I did n't want to see you I would n't be bothered if you did n't turn up . I do want to see you . That 's why I was very disappointed when you did n't turn up . I wo n't bother asking you to try and see it from my point of view because I have no wish to have an argument . I 'm really sorry for offending you . If you 're too busy with work then why did n't you say so ? You do n't have to come and see me if you 're stressed about you dissertation , exams , etc. Just let me know . As for my reply to &NAME 's email ; that was not petulance and should not have been taken for it . It is quite true that I am not usually one to go to formal dinners ( having only been to &NUM and I 'm in third year ) so I think me reply was quite justified and was intended top be a positive statement of approval for &NAME 's idea . Whether your judgement of it was coloured by our earlier " encounter " I have no idea , but I certainoly hope everyone else did n't see it the same way as you did . " What happened to forgive and forget ? " I 've forgiven and forgotten - now , but it took me a few hours to do so .

SUBJECT: [ Fwd : [ Fwd : Good wife guide ] ] ] ] ] Something to give to your espoused ... when and if . &NAME x Dear girls , I know I do n't normally send forwards , but this is hilarious , and made me laugh in the library ( a rare occurrence ... ) &NAME ! Lots of love , &NAME &NAME , leanda sent me this , I nearly did n't bother reading it but it 's so so funny - even I disagree with some parts ! ! ! ! ! ! Love you both loads &NAME xxxx This is for anyone who joined me in wishing that we could just get married and forget about the careers office ! ! &NAME <QUOTE> The &NAME Wife Guide . . . ... classic ! This is an actual extract from a &NAME Economics textbook printed in the early 60's. Absolutely unbelievable . Men love it ! Women ca n't believe it ! The &NAME Wife Guide . Have dinner ready . Plan ahead , even the night before , to have a delicious meal ready on time for his return from work . This is a way of letting him know that you have been thinking about him and are concerned about his needs . Most men are hungry when they come home and the prospect of a good meal ( especially his favourite dish ) is part of the warm welcome needed . Prepare yourself . Take &NUM minutes to rest so you will be refreshed when he arrives . Touch up your make-up , put a ribbon in your hair and be fresh looking . He has just been with a lot of work weary people . Be a little &NAME and a little more interesting for him . His boring day may need a lift and one of your duties is to provide it . Clear away the clutter . Make &NUM last trip through the main part of the house just before your husband arrives . Gather up schoolbooks , toys , papers etc. and then run a dust cloth over the tables . During the colder months of the year you should prepare and light a fire for him to unwind by . Your husband will feel he has reached a haven of rest and order and it will give you a lift too . After all , catering for his comfort will provide you with immense personal satisfaction . Minimize all noise . At the time of his arrival eliminate all noise of the washer , dryer or vacuum . Try to encourage the children to be quiet . Be happy to see him . Greet him with a warm smile and show sincerity in your desire to please him . Listen to him . You may have a dozen important things to tell him , but the moment of his arrival is not the time . Let him talk first ; remember his topics of conversation are more important than yours . Make the evening his . Never complain if he comes home late or goes out to dinner or other places of entertainment without you . Instead , try to understand his world of strain and pressure and his very real need to be at home and relax . Try to make sure your home is a place of peace , order and tranquillity where your husband can renew himself in body and spirit . Do n't greet him with complaints and problems . Do n't complain if he 's late home for dinner , or even stays out all night . Count this as minor compared to what he might have gone through that day . Make him comfortable .

This is a way of letting him know that you have been thinking about him and are concerned about his needs . Most men are hungry when they come home and the prospect of a good meal ( especially his favourite dish ) is part of the warm welcome needed . Prepare yourself . Take &NUM minutes to rest so you will be refreshed when he arrives . Touch up your make-up , put a ribbon in your hair and be fresh looking . He has just been with a lot of work weary people . Be a little &NAME and a little more interesting for him . His boring day may need a lift and one of your duties is to provide it . Clear away the clutter .

During the colder months of the year you should prepare and light a fire for him to unwind by . Your husband will feel he has reached a haven of rest and order and it will give you a lift too . After all , catering for his comfort will provide you with immense personal satisfaction . Minimize all noise . At the time of his arrival eliminate all noise of the washer , dryer or vacuum . Try to encourage the children to be quiet . Be happy to see him . Greet him with a warm smile and show sincerity in your desire to please him . Listen to him . You may have a dozen important things to tell him , but the moment of his arrival is not the time . Let him talk first ; remember his topics of conversation are more important than yours . Make the evening his . Never complain if he comes home late or goes out to dinner or other places of entertainment without you . Instead , try to understand his world of strain and pressure and his very real need to be at home and relax . Try to make sure your home is a place of peace , order and tranquillity where your husband can renew himself in body and spirit . Do n't greet him with complaints and problems . Do n't complain if he 's late home for dinner , or even stays out all night . Count this as minor compared to what he might have gone through that day . Make him comfortable . Have him lean back in a comfortable chair or have him lie down in the bedroom . Have a cool or warm drink ready for him . Arrange the pillow and offer to take off his shoes .

Last night I lost my mobile phone and felt such a profound loss that I was quite shaken . I had left it on an express bus to &NAME and therefore despaired of all hope of ever seeing it again . Amazingly it was still on the bus when it got back into &NAME later that evening and I was reunited ! &NAME - &NAME you are enjoying your holiday in &NAME . &NAME - See you on Sunday evening ! &NAME - &NAME your placement is going well too . &NAME - &NAME ! Are you still practising scrabble ? &NAME - &NAME , absent one . &NAME - Did you enjoy your holiday in &NAME ? &NAME - Hopefully I 'll see you in a week or so sometime . &NAME - &NAME , absent one . &NAME - It was good to talk to you the other evening , enjoy &NAME ! I 'm not sure about boredom being decadent . I 'll try and write properly soon . Very best wishes , &NAME <END_QUOTE> &NAME &NAME is the easiest way to share and print your photos : Click Here 
SUBJECT: Hi Dear &NAME , Hello ! How are you ? I wo n't ask you if you enjoyed your holiday in &NAME , but take my word for it - it does have some shops ; they just tend to congregate in cities . Thanks for your postcard - I got it yesterday . Hope you 're enjoying being at home again . I 'm enjoying living in the flat ; it 's good fun so far . Well , my placement is good . I 'm doing research on coatings for paint - which is much more interesting than it sounds honestly ! I say 'doing " , but I have n't really started yet due to &NUM thing and another . Most of my time so far has been spent reading patents and being inducted . There are a few other students working there too , so that 's nice . We were supposed to start doing some experiments today but then it was pointed out we did n't have safety footwear , so that required a little trip out to buy some maybe tomorrow will see some work Wonderfully , I do n't have to get up at 6am every day any more ! I 've found someone who works there and lives in &NAME , so he gives me a lift there and back . Sorry I have n't emailed much - internet access has been rather difficult as college is the nearest online place for me and I only manage to check it once or twice a week ! However , I now have a computer at work so that should make things easier . My family has been staying with me last week . They were having a holiday in and around &NAME . Last Sunday &NAME and his family came to visit for the evening . We all went out for a meal to &NAME &NAME , and &NAME and I also went to visit &NAME &NAME . &NAME wanted to try and look around &NAME &CHAR , but it was locked . However , &NAME I was open so we wandered in there and looked around a little - most bizarre ! We also had a little look in &NAME &NAME &NAME to hear from you soon and looking forward to seeing you at the beginning of September . Are you happy for me to come down to &NAME , because you 're quite welcome to come up and visit me this time ? Love &NAME

SUBJECT: Message from &NAME &NAME , and welcome to this email on behalf of &NAME ... I went up to &NAME today ( where &NAME is completing the second part of her training ) to see &NAME , and she desired me to send you this , as she has little access to email , altho " she will shortly . Apologies for information which some of you know ; it bears repeating . &NAME is working for Youth for &NAME doing advanced sports evangelism , and as of next week will be based in &NAME , en &NAME . She will be living with her boss , &NAME , who is about &NUM , and the other member of the team , &CHAR / &NAME , who is about &NUM years younger than &NAME . She has been training with them and &NUM others ( who will form a team in the &NAME ) . OK , I 'm now going to paraphrase what &NAME asked me to tell you ... &NAME is feeling very blessed that &NAME has saught to use her talents in a way that she will enjoy . She feels that she has a particular calling this year towards girls , and getting alongside them- she is looking forward to doing &NUM , and possibly to coaching some hockey as well as football . She is glad to be in &NAME , and her time in &NAME has made her thankful for the great provision &NAME is making for her . On a slightly less-good note , she is finding the training quite hard , as the other trainees are all boys , and are from differing backgrounds to herself . While she is glad that &NAME is challenging her to come out of her comfort zone , being the oldest , most mature and only female member of the team can sometimes be trying for her . Please ( if you want to ) pray for all of the above , and ask for security for &NAME as a lone girl , her safety may be called into question . I had such a wonderful time with &NAME it was fabulous to see her , and see how faithfully she is prepared to adhere to &NAME 's plans for her . Her time in &NAME has developed her leadership skills , and the photos were fantastic- such a beautiful place . Finally , if I have missed anyone vital from the email list , please let me know . &NAME will have email next week , so feel free to reply to her .

SUBJECT: [ Fwd : Re : &NAME ] Here you are &NAME ... " The Tales of &NAME " Version &NUM &NAME wrote : <QUOTE> Hi &NAME , When you are bored , when you have absolutely nothing to do , when time seems to stand still , I would be grateful if you could add anything to , and correct incorrect details , in this following tale . &CHAR BRIEF HISTORY OF THE ORIGINS AND WAYS OF " QUON " &NUM evening , many many moons ago , when I was sojourning in the room of &NAME , we began to weave a strange and haunting tale ... <END_QUOTE> A strange  and haunting tale indeed ... <QUOTE> As I inhaled ( a questionable habit ) copious quantities of &NAME 's extra strong coffee powder , I happened to mention a particular Raven I often saw on the roof outside my room . On hearing this , &NAME looked up , slightly startled . I could tell by the piercing look in his left eye that I had stumbled unwittingly upon something worth finding out . Little did I realise how deep the knowledge he carried within himself would affect our lives . cough , before proceeding to tell me that the Raven was , in fact , a messenger . I paused and glanced at him questioningly . The Raven , he continued , was reconnoitring this world of ours on direct orders from the &NAME &NAME Council . I learned that the bird 's name , translated into our tongue , was " &NAME " . This means " Bringer of Comfortable Mattresses " , but that is irrelevant . <END_QUOTE> May I interject that if one were to try to pronounce " &NAME " in the native Ravenish tongue , it would sound something close to this : " &NAME " This however is quite hard to pronounce and so we shorten it to simply " &NAME " . <QUOTE> &NAME had journeyed many light years from the Planet of &NAME where war was ravaging his beloved homeland . He had been instructed by the High Council to search for sentient life-forms willing to aid them in their struggle against the vicious , life-sucking " S.N.A.I.L. " sub-species . That is , &NAME &NAME &NAME &NAME . These creatures represent a serious threat to the stability of the &CHAR &NAME , where the planet of &NAME exists . Finding himself in the City of &NAME , away from his home world 's air , he immediately took on the guise of the common " raven " , in character with the rest of his species . For indeed , whenever they leave the nitrous oxide filled environment of the Planet of &NAME its inhabitants develop a completely new genetic make-up , transforming them into their second form - a common raven . <END_QUOTE> Second form ? Second effervation I think you 'll find ... <QUOTE> Once in &NAME , &NAME headed for the place most likely to contain sentient life - &NAME &NAME 's College . He had read the University prospectus on his journey through the stars and sought out &NUM &NAME &NAME in particular as his sensors indicated a particularly high concentration of " unusual " neural development there . &NAME made his temporary headquarters , or " nest " as the locals called it , in the dense forest canopy to the rear of &NAME 's. Once base contact had been established he began a swift reconnoitre of the area by air . Suddenly a sharp sensation ran through his head . Then , almost imperceptibly slowly , a voice began to form in his brain , words entered his mind and he found himself listening to and communicating with another life-form . This being , he soon discovered , was called " &NAME " and lived at the top of &NUM &NAME &NAME . As the days went by their knowledge of each other grew and &NAME became a frequent visitor to &NAME 's room . He discovered in this human a mutual understanding of celestial physics and stellar thermodynamics . , not to mention inter-dimensional field theory on which &NAME himself was a renowned expert . <END_QUOTE> Indeed , this is how it happened ... <QUOTE> So , that brings me to the part of the tale where &NAME confided in me the knowledge of the existence of &NAME . Thereafter , I wished with all my heart to greet this curious emissary face to face . &NAME informed me that I should be able to do this the following morning and told me that the phrase " &NAME " ( I greet the o mighty one ) would be sure to produce an apt response . Indeed , tomorrow morning came , and I did all &NAME had suggested , additionally performing the Universal Greeting towards the bird . this involves lying down on the floor whilst shaking one 's head from side to side &NUM times then nodding it up and down &NUM times , during which time it is most proper to say the other being 's name in their native tongue . As I began to become acquainted with &NAME language became a bit of a problem . However , that particular hurdle was soon crossed as &NAME bestowed my computer with a Universal Translator , enabling perfect understanding between us to occur . Over the weeks my friendship with this strange ambassador has deepened remarkably . &NUM or &NUM curious incidents have taken place , such as the time when &NAME 's feathers turned white , giving him the appearance of a magpie . Upon consultation with &NAME I learned that this was normal behaviour , due to the tri-annual change of gender cycle which &NAME 's species undergo . I would not say that our relationship has always been perfect . Indeed , far from it . &NAME displays irritable tendencies at times and can become quite angry over relatively trivial misdemeanours , such as when I forget to perform the Universal Greeting daily towards him . However , on the whole , he is an absolutely charming fellow , and I hope you have the pleasure of meeting him some day . <END_QUOTE> A quite fantastic tale , and one that deserves telling ... <QUOTE> &NAME [ in ] <END_QUOTE> &NAME [ in ] 
SUBJECT: Re : An email &NAME , Thank you kindly for emailing me with all those fascinating questions . I will endeavour to answer them now : &NUM &NUM So , how is your first week back in &NAME going ? My first week back in &NAME was not spent in &NAME , if you see what I mean . Nor was it spent in the bath , if that 's what you meant . I was away in &NAME at a Christian schools convention , where I judged junior platform events and played the bass guitar with my dad in the evening meetings . ( We did not play the same guitar , in case that 's what you were thinking . ) &NUM &NUM Are you enjoying your job ? I have not started my job yet . That begins on Monday . I spoke to my boss today who has decided to take my first week off in &NAME . I told him I thought that was a bit of a desperate measure - he disagreed . &NUM &NUM Why have n't you emailed me yet ? I site the answer to question &NUM as a possible answer to the above question . &NUM &NUM What time is it ? The time is &NUM : &NUM according to my computer clock . &NUM &NUM Do you like being asked questions ? &NAME , &NAME I suppose so . &NUM &NUM Could you think of as many questions as me ? Almost certainly - for example : How many sheep are there in your house ? How many sheep are there in your garden ? How many sheep are there in your village ? How many sheep are there in your county ? How many sheep are there in &NAME ? I do not expect answers to these questions . I 'm glad to hear you are learning to cook . I also cooked dinner last night , and very nice it was too . You 'll be pleased to learn that I have a 'really useful student cook-book " ! Well , tonight I am going with my family round to a friend 's house for some kind of take-away . It will probably not involve ravens , but I 'm sure it will be nice anyway . See you later &NAME , &NAME 
SUBJECT: &NAME IS DEAD ! ! ! ! ! ! It 's true ! ! ! ! ! ! ! Reports are coming in of sightings of a lifeless Raven , lying below a tree somewhere in &NAME . It seems the Raven in question was attempting some form of strange and twisted communication ritual involving bizarre movements of the head . The word on the street is that this supposed Raven could actually be the one known only as &NAME , an intergalactic ambassador from the &CHAR &NAME . We now turn to our reporter on the scene . ... So , exactly how many reports have we had in. Reporter : Well ... actually not that many . How many ? Reporter : Well ... ummm ... not very many at all really . HOW MANY ? ? ? ? Reporter : Well , actually just the one . Just the one ! ! ! ? ? ? ? ! ! ! Who from . Reporter : The eye-witness was &NUM &NAME &NAME , who appeared to be quite flustered and claimed she had seen the " raven " lying below the tree . She also muttered something about being sick and tired of searching for &NUM . We do not believe this had anything to do with her story however . FOLKS ! ! ! ! ! I am hearing some breaking news . ... WHAT ? ? ? . . ... SURELY NOT ! ! ! ! ! . ... folks , I have just heard from reliable sources that the whole story is a hoax - set up by some poor disillusioned girl from &NAME who lost it somewhere during the search for this remarkable bird . The name " &NAME " has been banded about in relation to the &NAME incident , and some say that the aforementioned persona has had contact with the Raven since the reported 'death " of &NAME . &NUM LIVES ON ! ! ! ! ! ! 
SUBJECT: It could be YOU &NAME , I hope these accusations regarding &NAME are all scandalous false-hoods . Welcome home ! ! ! ! ( unless you are reading this email on holiday because you found a way to check your account - in which case Have a great holiday ! ! ! ) Speak soon , PB 
SUBJECT: Re : Secrecy on &NAME 's movements lifted ! &NAME , I do n't know what all this about you getting news about me from &NAME is ! Do n't trust someone who once tried to frame the death of &NAME ! I 'm sure all the things you 've heard are scandalous falsehoods ! Very impressed with the &NAME slide-show . FANTASTIC ! &NAME , with so much work , I do not have time to put together such fascinating documents ! I 'm sure anybody evesdropping on our correspondences would think we had serious psychological problems ! I wonder whether your next project might be to set up a " followers of &NAME " website . &WEBSITE or &WEBSITE or maybe &WEBSITE ( .gal is a galactic domain extension ) or maybe a commercial version &WEBSITE We could be up for making a lot of money here &NAME ! What do you think ? Anyway , we 'll talk soon . Later , &NAME 
SUBJECT: &NAME ? How dare you ! Yeah , hi &NAME . &NAME so long ! Some of us have work to do you know ( only joking ) . Just &NUM weeks to go for me now ! ! ! ! ! ! ! &NAME ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! It has been quite a long haul , but I 'm really glad I 've done it . Who knows what doors it will open in the future as well . &NAME is good like that . Today my brother and I drove back to the house we used to live in &NUM years ago . We met some of our old neighbours , who at first asked us if we were lost , and then when we told them who we were they ahhhed and oohhhed , and then invited us in for a drink . We have not seen them for &NUM years ! It was really great . My new sound module sounds great . I 've got some excellent piano sounds - thought you might be pleased to know that . So , I hope your one-day-a-week job is not taxing you too much &NAME . Listen , do n't tire yourself working so much - it 's just not worth it . Anyway , enough of the sarcasm . &NAME all is well . We must talk about flat stuff soon . Large it &NAME , PB &NAME Oh , by the way , I would treat reports of &NAME frying ravens ( or whatever it was ) with very great suspicion .

( &NAME ) Now , do you really think you can put me off answering the questions about sheep ? ! I 'm just itching to have a go ; How many sheep are there in your house ? None . Animals are nor welcome in my abode , even sheep . How many sheep are there in your garden ? Once again , none , usually . You see , since our garden is literally a ploughed field ( tractor and plough came last week ) there is no motivation for sheep to grace it with their presence . Oh well , we shall soon plant a nice lawn for them . How many sheep are there in your village ? I do not live in a village . I live in the COUNTRY . I.e. no nasty unhygienic people in close proximity abiding . I live surrounded by fields , some of which contain sheep , &NUM , grass , and other natural produce of the Scottish Borders agricultural system . I have never taken the time to count the sheep , just the &NUM , and therefore &NUM cannot give you an exact figure . &NAME . Will this ruin your life for good ? How many sheep are there in your county ? Check the internet . I would n't like to hazard a guess . I might be gloriously and utterly wrong . How many sheep are there in &NAME ? Multiply the population of &NAME by the number of people in &NAME divided by the number of daffodils in &NAME . The sheep , as well put by a young foreign guest of our family last summer is , after all , the national hero . There is a statue of him in a quaint southern Scottish town that 's what prompted this epitaph . I also cooked dinner last night , and very nice it was too .

SUBJECT: &NAME SIGHTED IN TREE News is fast coming in of a reported sighting of &NAME , the raven who doubles as an intergalactic emissary . An eye-witness source confirmed the sighting to our special reporter . Here are the latest details in this developing situation Date of sighting : Saturday 8th July &NUM &NAME : In a tree near &NAME &NAME is a little known area in &NAME 's national park . Exact location : &NAME : 54 &NUM ; &NUM &NUM &NAME &NAME : 1 &NUM ; &NUM &NUM &NAME Our eye-witness source is a &NAME &NAME from &NAME . Appearing rather bemused she told our reporter she was convinced that I saw him , later making the omission that I may be entirely wrong : it may not have been &NAME who I saw . Her fascinating ideas on the reason for &NAME to be so far north are as follows ; I am sure that he has got wind of the fact that &NAME is now stationed in &NAME , and he was on his way there . As the raven flies , &NAME is directly midway between &NAME and &NAME 's home . Is this just a stunning coincidence ? When we asked &NAME to comment he retorted sardonically that Any idea that he is making his way to see me is pure speculation and I really cannot comment on what seems a rather absurd notion . &NAME 's immediate response to this unveiled attack on her sanity is unprintable . However , she did later make the following public statement , I have a programme whereby you can distort photos and make people 's noses and ears bigger or whatever you fancy . When questioned further , she just smiled in an unsettling kind of way . Our editor wisely noted that there could be trouble ahead here . &NAME 's account of &NAME 's behaviour shed 's little light on the situation ; He was so evidently grumpy ( squawking &NAME and viciously attacking the surrounding tree branches ) that I can only assume that his tracking devices are causing problems for him . ( &NAME is a technical term . ) What could have made &NAME so mad ? Is &NAME telling the whole truth or hiding some vital information ? &NAME suggested that You may have to resort to contacting &NAME &NAME ( DIFFERENT is spelled R.I.G.H.T. ) about it so that he can telepathically communicate with &NAME and put him back on the right course . A very good idea and one which we are following up as you read . However , there is only &NUM person who can tell us what we need to know , and that 's &NAME but where is &NAME ? &NAME is heading the section detailed to locate the renegade raven . We asked her what her strategy was for finding The Emissary . Her spokesman said she has her whole family looking out for a dumb-looking raven . &CHAR leaked report from &NAME 's &NAME &NAME Ltd. later informed us that he had been subsequently sacked for dissing the undefiled name of &NAME , pending an official investigation by the &NAME &NAME Council . We will keep you updated in this important state of affairs . Remember , keep your eyes open for &NAME . All sightings should be reported to the official Hunt for &NAME &NAME &NAME . Telephone number &NUM &NUM &NUM . Please ask for &NAME before describing you sighting in detail to those of the establishment without the required security clearance . Thank you . 
SUBJECT: My Vision &NAME , How is my Scottish friend ? Who ! ? What ? ! Where ? ! When ? ! Most importantly why ? Actually , I am fine . I 've just returned from my camp . It was fantastic , although I am absolutely totally mind-numbingly exhausted . I only got &NUM hours of sleep per night for the week . Sleeping in a dormitory with &NUM hyperactive unnaturally energetic ten-year old kids has many disadvantages . However , I really enjoyed it all and the weather was perfectly splendid . I knew a few people before I got there and knew a lot more by the time I left . I was in &NAME &NAME yesterday ( not to see the golf , but to get a kettle ) and it was totally packed because of the Open . I have just received a disconcertingly strange e-mail from &NAME about her bikini . I was absolutely disgusted . Are you on holiday ? Hmmm. That 's a difficult one . Considering term finished on the 30th June and does n't start again until October Yes ! I 'm going to &NAME on Saturday though and looking forward to it all except the heat , the flight and the language difficulties . I only speak Scottish and English . Oh well ! It will be an experience I am sure ! I hope your work is going well and you are coping with the lack of spare time which you seem to have . Considering I have n't stopped for literally more than &NUM minutes in the last week I can empathise with you considerably . I just cannot understand how &NAME can do one of those camps this &NAME ! She ca n't be human . Now , on to business &NAME ! ! ! What ! ! ! &NAME is dead ! ! ! Oh , thank goodness , it 's just a hoax ! That had be badly shaken for a moment there . Do I take it rightly then ? - that &NAME has performed an elaborate hoax by staging the death of &NAME ? Just wait till I see her . I am most displeased . I arranged a legally binding contract with &NAME 's &NAME &NAME Ltd. I am not about to take this lying down . &NAME , old chap , would you send me the transcripts from the reporter who interviewed &NAME please ? I need some solid evidence to pursue my vendetta . some poor disillusioned girl from &NAME who lost it Enough of the sympathy ! This is serious now . &NAME appeared to me in a dream last night . ( I had eaten some cheese the night before ) Here is what I can remember of my dream As I slept , I saw a hazy black object speeding across a seemingly huge expanse of silvery grey sky . As I watched , the object began to grow in size and became darker and blacker than the deepest hole or cave you can imagine . What appeared to be stars began to spiral towards the object until there were so many that they flowed into it in the likeness of a milky river glistening with hundreds and thousands of precious stones . Then the scene changed suddenly . I was standing on the top of a huge mountain , overlooking a city which I recognised . As I watched , an arrow of flaming fire appeared from the north and sped down into the heart of the city . Sounds of wailing and moaning reached my ears as the entire city was consumed . The scene changed once again . I found myself standing on the banks of a cool shallow river . On the opposite bank a shadowy figure was lurking . I called on him in clear and ringing tones to show himself . He wore darkness as a cloak and his face was more alive looking than any I had ever beheld . He was a raven . He spoke to me in a language I did not understand , using words &NUM cannot remember . However , I understood his message . His face began to swim before me - I could see cities , kings and nations in his eyes . Then all was black . The dream is interpreted as follows In the opening scene we see &NAME winging his way across the hiajfhboj , which is the equivalent of the lowlands in his home planet of &NAME sometimes described as Planet of the &NAME . The increase in &NAME 's size correlates to his flourishing knowledge of the ways of men . His similarity to a black hole emphasises the idea persistent in Siluhfodascian literature that they alone will &NUM day know everything , that there shall be no end to their knowledge and dominion . The river of stars represent those who oppress and defy &NAME , his people , the &NAME , and their ways . Many are those , bright perhaps in their own way , but ultimately consumed . This scene represents the power and majesty of the &NAME . The second scene portrays the judgement on those who diss &NAME . The city represents &NAME and the judgement upon &NAME for staging &NAME 's death is inevitable . The arrow from the north is &NAME , stationed as he is in some secret location near my abode . This scene represents the terror and judgement of the &NAME . In the final scene the river portrays the uncrossable divide between the land of men and the &NAME . No man can ever set foot in &NAME perhaps this is just as well . The raven is a picture of &NAME 's people . Their knowledge and antiquity burning bright but cloaked from us by vast distances in time and space . &NAME thought as a means of communication is briefly referred to here . The sudden end of the dream suggests a hint of what lies in the future for &NAME . Could they be trying to pass on some of their ways and dominion to us as their time runs out . This scene represents the personality and communicativeness of the &NAME . Thank you . Make of that what you will , but it 's message is startlingly clear to me . I fear it came as a warning against us becoming to familiar with &NAME as to stage elaborate hoaxes . Enough , no more , tis not as much as it was before - &NAME . The name &NAME has been banded about in relation to the &NAME incident , and some say that the aforementioned persona has had contact with the Raven since the reported 'death " of &NAME . Quite true . He followed me to &NAME camp . He observed me playing frisbee golf and football , was concealed in a tree as I was soaked with water by ten-year olds , peered through my dorm window as I caught some brief sleep . Yes , I have had contact with &NAME , not to mention my dream . Yours in &NAME &NAME 
SUBJECT: Who , me ? ? ? Hi &NAME , Did you get my text messages ? Cool ! What did you think of &NAME 's Voyager leaflet ? Cool ! What did you think of &NAME 's e-mail about &NAME ? Scandalous ! Anyway , as you may have guessed , I went down to see the flat yesterday . I had a great day and saw &NAME too . I think the bedrooms all need a coat of paint . The rest of the flat is optional . We have acquired ( do n't ask me how ! ) an ironing board and a TV table which are not in the official inventory . There were no letters for you in the post box . Have we decided finally on bedroom allocation ? If it 's what I think it is then &NAME 's smells of smoke . Most of the curtains do n't match . In the living area there are &NUM darkish blue &NUM seater settees . The fridge has a minor defect . We have a telephone socket ! ! ! It 's in the hall and there is a telephone ( extremely old , disgusting , dirty , unhygienic , will be disposed of as soon as I remember the rubber gloves type ) but the line is not connected . The little intercom system with the front door is fun ! &NAME and I played around with it for a while . We need air freshener musty smell in most areas . No bed linen , duvets , pillows etc. are provided . There are no headboards on the beds , which are thick metal and extremely ugly I 'll be bringing a valance . The toilet makes a noise like an aeroplane taking off . ( At least it 's not an elephant trumpeting this year ! ) The windows are quite nice . There is a cool little spy-hole in the flat door &NAME and I played with that too . The flat address is ; &NAME &CHAR , &NAME &NAME 's &NAME , &NAME , &NAME 4DS . The electricity works by a meter . There is an electronic key which must be taken down to a power shop and recharged in return for money . There is &pound; &NUM left in our meter . Most flats use &pound; &NUM per week , so we 're rather lucky . We also went to College in search of &NAME 's shirts . &NUM is basically a builder 's yard ! The floors are up , etc Unfortunately we could n't find the shirts , but they may be in a lock-up so do n't give up hope yet ! I also went to the NatWest bank and enquired about flat accounts . &NAME . We shall need to discuss that nearer the time . Basically we need &NUM other person to operate it . Anyway , I 'm off on holiday early Saturday morning . E-mail silence for nearly &NUM weeks how awful ! Hope your job is going well . Hope your family is well . Will hear from you soon hopefully . Yours in the &NAME &NAME , &NAME ( Remember that ! ) 
SUBJECT: Q. I hope you do n't have the cheek to pick this up before you get home My most humble apologies I mighty one . I cannot account for the strange and prolific effervations exhibited by &NAME at the moment . What ! ! ! Tell me more ! I had no idea ! Well &NAME , I had a marvellous holiday . I will let you see my holiday snaps when they are developed they will be quite different from normal photos , mark my words . Anyway , that is something for you to anticipate joyously . &NAME to hear from you the day before yesterday . Incidentally , the temperature while I was phoning was &NUM degrees in the shade . Needless to say , I was not in the shade . I have acquired some French and Swiss recipes , with a prolific use of garlic in them . I hope you get my postcard soon . &NAME is deliciously cool ! Have you heard about the abominable mess the Scottish exam results are in incompetence ! Anyway , I think I shall do some developing this afternoon . &NAME this is so short an email , but I am waiting until later before I give you the news of &NAME . You are being kept in suspense . See you , &NAME &NAME &NAME what does &NAME know about &NAME ? ? ? She told me that frankly these sick perversions disgust me . ? ? ? Yours worriedly , &NAME . 
SUBJECT: &NAME ? Hi &NAME , Just wondering if you 're ... alive ? Still sentient ? Let me know at your convenience . Thank you , &NAME ( We had an absolutely horrendous lightening storm this morning . It cut the power here . I bet you 're glad you 're not on holiday in &NAME like &NAME ! ) 
SUBJECT: &NAME and &NAME &NAME ! Hi there ! Glad you 've finished work , you are no doubt relieved . Well , &NAME nutrient supplements ! I 've never heard of them . However , in general I think taking vitamin supplements is a good idea and has a positive effect on a person 's health . I think I 'll have to try and start to take iron supplements , as I often tend to approach blackout when I stand up . Our foods these days do not contain what they should do . At any rate , if what I fear flat cooking will be like is true , I would definitely take them . I myself take a nutritional health drink most mornings . Anyway , this flat stuff is just chaos . I ask you , does anyone actually read the e-mails I send them ? ! When I write things like please make your views known to the collective in bold capital letters , you 'd think they 'd realise I was trying to get a message across ! &NAME has been conjuring up more devious anti-Quon propaganda . Here is a sample of her latest gossip Oh , I saw &NAME the other day , and you wo n't believe what he was up to ! We were eating our picnic [ & ] I saw &NAME fly past . He made as if he was going to land on the grass beside our car , and suddenly lunged to the left towards an unsuspecting seagull and proceeded to maul it Good old &NAME ! He was good enough to let his victim fly away though - so he did n't absolutely kill it . We really must take her to task ! This is becoming an obsession with her . Do you think she is working for some dark and sinister anti-Quon league ? Send me your wisdom and thoughts on the matter . I hope your phone gets fixed . Anyway , write back soon , as e-mails are the highlights of my life ! By the way , &NAME also seems to think she is a member of the canine species

Is &NAME important , and what is it ? Are track / song memories important ? What are polyphonic notes are they important ? Is the number of sounds important ? I.e. Would a slightly less expensive model be a lot worse than these ? Thanks for your anticipated help ! Please let me know a.s.a.p. if possible , as I have to buy it tomorrow or Wednesday ! Also , would you be interested in bringing KITCHEN SCISSORS , and DUSTERS to the flat as &NAME forgot them ? Also if you have a TOASTER , &NAME forgot that too ! This would be very helpful . See you soon , &NAME 
SUBJECT: &NAME Dear &NAME , Hi . It was great to see you and everyone else in &NAME . We never got around to discussing prayer and bible study as an integral part of flat life . Perhaps we should ?

And no , before you ask , I did n't check . Oh , I am looking forward to living in this flat . Do you have any ideas for the name which should appear on our cheque book ? ( It 's top priority decisions like these which we need to sort out immediately . ) Did we definitely decide the stuffed moose 's head was impossible ? I think it would look imposing .

SUBJECT: Re : &NAME ! ! ! &NAME , My sister is in love with you . &NAME , she 's not . Anyway , I 'm glad you are wallpapering . It will do you good to get that messy paste all over your baby-smooth hands ! I 've been away for the last few days visiting my friend &NAME in &NAME ( you might remember him ) . I had a GREAT time and it was not at all ridiculous ! Apart from the fact that I missed my train on the way home , and thus had to buy another ticket - quite painful - and that meant that I missed my football match today - significantly unimpressive . My computer science revision work is fairly boring , especially software engineering - I just do n't want to learn about requirements engineering - I just DO N'T! Anyway - speak soon . &CHAR &NAME , I am NOT AMUSED ! ! Just how many people has " &NAME shown that picture to ? Revenge is sweet &NAME &NAME and I am a master of it .

SUBJECT: You 've obviously passed Warp &NUM ! &NAME ! ! ! Hi , I 'm well . " Am I bored ? Well , probably not , although I 'm rather lazy . I 've not done as much Chemistry as I could have . No , I most certainly am not revising my quantum mechanics ! ( Yet ! ) That would make me disillusioned for the entire holiday . So , you 're in a new house ! Well , anything is bound to be 'relatively tiny after &NUM rooms ! Yes , I hope your room will be alright too . When you ask me to say hi to " everyone , to whom are you referring ? By the way , I 've just finished watching " Voyager on the television . Did you see it ? If you did , then I 'll just say that living with you if you had passed warp &NUM would n't be very different than reality just kidding ! So , what are you up too ? Are you sharing a bedroom in your new house ? How is &NAME ? &NAME is in good health , thanks to your restorative makeover on Saturday . Are your nails still that " hideous shade of colour ? Well , &NAME , I was wondering if you had any pictures of yourself which you could e-mail me . You see , I 'm looking for one of you with a condescending gaze , and also &NUM where you have your hands raised up , expounding some theory or suchlike . Can you help ? Well , I hope you 're " keeping moving on . &NAME feels very isolated up here . Tell me , does it feel isolated living in the deep south , where most other people live ? I have trouble imagining that it can ! Have you heard from anyone else whom I know yet ? Well , I 'm trying to study as much as I can psychologically cope with , but I 'm going to be working in my dad 's bookshop tomorrow and Friday this week . That should give me a welcome break from the hallowed halls of chemistry . I 'm going to be spending the New Year up in the Scottish Highlands &NAME , and may possibly be going skiing . Last time I skied I fell over . I was about &NUM . I did n't much care for it and have never been back since . I hope I do n't fall down this time as it would be infinitely more embarrassing ! Anyway , I am also looking forward to going on the internet much more as we are changing our &NAME to one which provides a totally free service ntl . Tell me , does &NAME have netscape instant messenger service ? &NAME is thinking of downloading it . ( She has SUCH a mind of her own ! ) I hope you and your family are all well in your new home . I 'm really looking forward to receiving your amusing e-mail ! &NAME &NAME I tilt my head slightly and to the side , and smile in a benign manner whilst half-closing my eyes .

SUBJECT: Re : &NAME Hi &NAME , &NAME , I 've been playing football tonight . I think I will be out tomorrow night too ( raving party animal ) . I might be able to chat on Wednesday eve . and I must do some more work this week ! Have you done anything exciting today &NAME ? I am going to buy a guitar with my friend &NAME tomorrow - for him that is ! My lap-top should be very good thankyou . See you soon , &NAME &NAME ! &NAME , good afternoon , this e-mail is from &NAME . Thank you for your e-mail , I had a wonderful holiday on the &NAME Isle . I 'm glad to hear you have been working . I 'm also pleased to receive , at long last , news that &NAME is still alive . Thank you . " &NAME is a bit better after I gave her a good clean-out and made sure all her components were in order . " - I 'm so happy for you both . " Guess what , I 'm buying a lap-top ! ! ! ! ! ! " - I 'm shocked . Is it any good ? I look forward to meeting " &NAME " , what is his hard drive called ? I 'll be very sorry not to see &NAME - I was counting on her presence this term to ensure we had a lovely time in the flat . " &NAME , the other day I overdrew my bank account for the first time . Now I have got an overdraft , just like all the other students ! " - Oh yes , it 's a well-known fact that absolutely all ( without any exceptions ) students have an overdraft . Welcome to the multinational , multilingual crowd that comprises the rest of the entire world student population . Incidentally , when you overdraw your bank , that means you are overdrawn - you do n't automatically have an overdraft . They charge you lots of money for being overdrawn without an overdraft . Well , today I had a lazy morning as I was tired from &NUM hours travelling yesterday - we did n't get home until &NAME last night . I then did a small amount of studying this afternoon , followed my moving some money through my various accounts ( always guaranteed to lift the corners of my mouth into a smile ) . I am shortly going outside ( it 's very windy weather , but otherwise pleasant ) to build a step up to our house . I will be using cement for the first time in my life ! Are you well ? When is &NAME due to enter Medlockworld ? Yes , I 'd love to chat online . Does tonight suit you ? If so , then what about 7pm ? If not , let me know when ? Until sometime in the near future &NAME 
SUBJECT: Sunday eve . Humans , If some combination of us are going to &NAME 's birthday on Sunday evening then we need to get back from &NAME 's house in time ( probably by about 7: &NUM ) . Is this OK with all ? &CHAR

SUBJECT: &CHAR + &CHAR &NAME & friends , Interesting email . I do not think it is as clear-cut as your friend would have us think . Just because science suggests something at this stage in history does n't mean that subsequent discoveries will not mean that our current hypotheses ( for after all , this is all we have ) must be radically changed / revised . Having said that , it is obviously important not to ignore what science is telling us today , and since you obviously want to talk about 'scientific " issues , here is where I stand , for your perusal : Age of the earth : I will make no statement on how old I think the earth is - I have no idea . If it is billions of years old , this does not affect my faith or my 'scientific " beliefs , but I do wonder what was happening during that vast length of time , and also why &NAME has told us nothing about it . If it is a number of thousands of years old then it does not surprise me . I do not have a problem at all with &NAME having 'deceived " us or something ( as your friend suggests ) . Just because I cannot understand something in light of what I see around me ( science ) does not mean that the thing cannot be true and I must be right . &NAME : I do not think we evolved from lower species . The &NAME says that &NAME formed living beings to reproduce after their own kind . This law seems to be observable when we look at the product of cross-breeding ( sterility ) . I do not see any convincing evidence that evolution occurs , or occured , or ever would occur . This does not mean that I deny that within species one can observe favourable transformations ( aka fruit-fly experiments ) . Being a computer scientist ( & working with statistics , orders of complexity , etc. ) , it is clear to me that the kinds of odds against Special Evolution are extraordinary - the law of thermodynamics indicates that this stands against the natural order of nature , and such concepts as the formation of &NAME are inconceivable by any other means than design . Without coming from a standpoint of " Evolution MUST have occurred " &NUM cannot see the evidence from the fossil record - surely we would expect thousands ( millions ) of gradual semi-formed organisms . In fact , most of our knowledge about 'missing links " is founded on fragments of bone . Evolutionists can hardly even show us the complete skeletal structure of a single " primate-man " . If science rests on evidence then I see no reason to suspect that Special Evolution might be true . Any other issues - let me know . &NAME " T.S. &NAME " wrote : <QUOTE> Guys , I hummed and hawed about sending this on to you , as I 've only just cooled down from the weekend , and I do n't want to get het up about it again , but I sent an e-mail to &NAME &NAME , a geologist in &NAME , who is in my home group , and whom I hold in the highest respect re our favorite topic . For the sake of both sides , read what he says . You do n't have to , and I do n't want this to divide our friendship , guys , but I thought that I would keep screaming in my head if something was n't said . Love you all loads , and thanks for the great day yesterday . &NAME Hi &NAME , Thanks for the emails - you obviously had a great time away ! As to the Creation / &NAME Earth business . Do n't get too upset about it . I think people are doing a great deal of harm , but they are usually willing to say &NAME is white when pressed . Saying that radiometric dating is unreliable is as silly as saying radio waves are unreliable ( when you change to channel &NUM , you usually get something with pictures and sound , unless there is a freak weather situation ) . Likewise dating . When several different decay schemes are used on the same rock , each with its own different half life , and give the same age ( concordance ) the method ca n't be said to be false . The half lives of some decay schemes are among the most precisely measured constants in physics - e.g. the &NAME clock which now replaces our world 's measurement of time . &NAME can go wrong - things such as weathering , or reheating rocks above their &NAME temperature ( which resets their clocks ) can occur - but they are the analog of the freak weather conditions in the TV example - understandable situations which can usually be checked . I also do n't believe our &NAME plays silly games with us . He would not give us the gift of scientific enquiry only to turn round and say - &NAME ha ! I only put those old-looking fossils there to fool you . I think a lot of the problems people with a young Earth viewpoint have stem with a fear that &NUM day science may pull the carpet of faith from under them . But if &NAME has made everything , science will never undermine what He 's done or prove He did n't do it ! Below I have lifted out bits of articles from the Christians in Science website . It is well worth looking at some of the material there , and following links to other articles and books . &NAME the term goes well ( and exams are not too harsh ) &NAME <QUOTE> <END_QUOTE> <END_QUOTE>

SUBJECT: a message from &NAME Hi &NAME , Thanks very much for providing that information concerning the telephone bill . Well , how are you ? I sent you a text message this morning , but you did n't reply . Are you enjoying the summer weather ? I am - we are living under a thick and chilly sea fog , and have been for the past &NUM days . I 've just finished my week in my Dad 's bookshop . It was quite good . I read some books , listened to music , did some work , sent some text messages , etc. Oh , and sold books too ! Next week I 'm painting our sitting room and starting to make a cobbled path . I 'm also meant to finish off our stone roundabout thingy , but it 's boring ! I 'm quite happy today ! Tomorrow I shall hopefully go for along cycle ride in the morning and attempt some of my dissertation in the afternoon . My parents areaway to visit my grandmother for the weekend , so it 's just me and my brother at home . I got back from &NAME last Sunday evening . I said goodbye to the flat and handed in the keys ( or rather , my parents did as they were staying in &NAME 's for a few days and there was no one at reception when I was leaving ) . The end of a chapter ( and a gloriously enjoyable on at that ) in my life . That means I get to turn over the page . I 've never thought of that before ! So , what are you whiling away your time with ? Have you found any jobs you want to do this summer ? Are your various computers all well ? Have you heard from &NAME ? I think it must be time for another mass-update . Definitely , I 'd guess tomorrow . Well , I 'd better go Very best wishes , &NAME 
SUBJECT: Try a little harder Is that it ? ! Oh well , I suppose it 's better than nothing ( most ungraciously written ) . Sorry about the attachment .

Are you still living in &NAME ? I 've had Thursday and Friday off work since the harvest has been slow in starting and there was literally nothing for me to do - all painting and tidying completed . Therefore I 've been spending my time doing some Chemistry . Last weekend I spend a lovely few days at &NAME 's house . She ate &NUM slices of pizza on Monday lunchtime at pizza hut and felt rather ill afterwards . Dear , oh dear . I consumed a much more respectable &NUM . After eating &NUM once with &NAME I decided not to attempt a repeat performance . Yesterday morning I went for a walk on the beach which we all went to when the flat came to visit &NAME .

I was leader of &NUM boys and they were just SO NOISY all the time . I thought my brain was going to explode . Still , at least after the first night they quietened down for sleep without too much arm-twisting . Yes , I acquired a number of femal fans during the week and I am now being bombarded with text messages by one of them - oh well . I now have &NAME staying with me , and we will probably attempt to do some shopping today ( do n't tell &NAME ! ) . I wonder if the shops in &NAME are open on Sunday . Life is crazy is n't it - I wonder what it 's all about . Also , I wish that I was better at being myself all the time - then life would be less tiring ( sometimes ) .

SUBJECT: Re : Hi &NAME ! Good morning &NAME ! Yes , I am indeed at my desk . I am currently struggling with the FLIPPING FORMATTING IN WORD . &NAME ! It is about to drive me nuts . Why ca n't it be sensible about outline numbering ? ? ? ? College is very quiet . I quite like it , although I think it would get somewhat boring if I stayed here for too long . &NAME and I went to her house last night . It was a good time , and I managed to mess up one of the keys on her piano whilst trying to fix it ! Not so good . Anyway , we had a nice stir-fry and she has just left this morning . I am seriously going to miss my internet connection when I go home . &NAME well , only a few weeks before I am reunited with the ether . &NAME , have a good day and say hi to &NAME for me . &NAME <QUOTE> Hi &NAME ! Are you busy working ? I am intending to begin today . Intending being the operative word . It is quite cold here in &NAME , but my parents have kindly said I may put the heating on if I begin to freeze . I spend most of yesterday getting all my stuff unpacked - quite a task . I 'm having chicken risotto for lunch ; and looking forward to it immensely . Last night I watched an episode of Voyager - a very good one actually . I 'm hoping you 're sitting at your desk with &NAME when you receive this so that you can reply , but perhaps you 're not . By the way , whatever you did to &NAME seems to have worked . I do n't have to log in when I start up any more ! The new backgrounds are lovely too . So , how is everyone in college ? How many of you are still left ? Is it lonely ? What do you think of &NAME more or less without its students ? Did you go to &NAME 's house yesterday ? Hope you have a good day . &NAME <END_QUOTE> 
SUBJECT: holla &NAME , whassup my main man ? Have they put you back together yet ? What was it like ? Did the nurse help you to have a shower ? ? ?

So , assuming we go somewhere some time in August , does anyone know of anywhere it would be nice ( and relatively inexpensive , i.e. &pound; 500-&pound; &NUM ish for all of us ) to go ? Please let me know if you know of anywhere . Ideas welcome . Enjoy the rest of the vacation . &NAME <END_QUOTE> 
SUBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT - PLEASE REPLY &NAME ! ! ! People , It is EXTREMELY IMPORTANT that you reply to this email within &NUM hours ( sorry for the capitalisation etc. , but it 's just to stress the gravity of this situation ) . Okay , this is " the thing " The holiday has the opportunity to take place this summer from the 7th to the 13th of July . However , we need to book the cottage &NAME if we want this to go ahead as it wo n't sit around very long at all . So , I need to know now whether or not you can commit yourselves to this . The cost should be about &pound; &NUM between all of us an excellent bargain brought to us by &NAME &NAME ( it 's his extended family 's cottage ) . There is enough room . The cottage is about &NUM meters from the beach on the &NAME coast . &NAME knows lots to do in the area as his family has been there since the &NAME Therefore we will be able to pursue a variety of activities which will hopefully suit everyone . So , please email or phone me , as the next steps will be being taken today or tomorrow . Your friendly holiday co-ordinator , &NAME 
SUBJECT: An answer to your query Dear &NAME , " How many people can &NAME 's cottage hold ? " - Well , before I answer your question may I just say that I am not completely incompetent . You do n't need to worry ; I am capable of organising a holiday without choosing a one-bedroomed house for a dozen people ... ! Okay - &NAME 's cottage has &NUM bedrooms and sleeps at least &NUM in each . There is also additional sleeping space on the floor of one of the large rooms he says . Oh , and since we were both online at the time you sent this message I 'm kind of curious as to why you did n't just ask me ? Answers on a postcard . Also , the number of people going ... Well , to save everyone having to reply to your email when they 've already replied to mine I shall tell you . So far &NAME , &NAME , &NAME , &NAME , &NAME , &NAME and &NAME are going . &NAME is in &NAME without her mobile so she has n't replied , but I assume from her previous emails she will be there . &NAME would like to go but is not going to commit herself ... &NAME is at her cousins with her mobile switched off so I have no idea . &NAME and &NAME have not replied yet . I will update you with any further developments . &NAME &NAME Thanks for the text . We think you 're taking this news rather oddly though . 
SUBJECT: &NAME Information Dear everyone , In response to &NAME 's email , yes , a decision has been made about the holiday . We have booked the house from the 7th to the 13th of July . The accommodation cost will be approximately &pound; &NUM in total for us all . I 'm sorry I did n't reply sooner , I was waiting to see if &NAME was going to come . People coming &NAME , &NAME , &NAME , &NAME , &NAME , &NAME , &NAME , &NAME People who would like to come but ca n't commit at present &NAME People who have not replied &NAME Everyone else is definitely not coming . So that is either &NUM , &NUM or &NUM of us . I 'm sure everything else will be worked out nearer the time , and after the exams . If there are any more questions please do n't hesitate to contact either &NAME or myself . &NAME those of you on holiday enjoy the last few days of the vacation and I may see some of you next week . &NAME

( obviously if you 're coming a long way by train you might want to think twice about this , but the more the merrier ) .

SUBJECT: &NAME Dear &NAME , Thanks for the message , but I am very sorry indeed to learn of your troubles . You must have had a very hard time of it ( not a good way to spend Christmas & the New Year ! ) . I do hope that matters get better swiftly , but clearly you should not return until you are sure that is sensible . Obviously the Department makes every effort to help in these circumstances , and the fact of the medical certificate will go into your records . I am certain that all the lecturers will do their best to give you handouts , possibly copies of lecture notes and individual tuition as necessary , but you will need to approach each person separately when you get back . If you miss &NUM phys . chem . lab . experiment , due to your convalescence , we would simply scale up your marks for the others , so do n't worry about that . Of course it would be a good idea to tackle the collection questions some time . Would it help for me to send you copies of the papers immediately after they are sat ? I do not think you need to do anything else as regards your absence . I will inform the departmental administrators and Dr. &NAME ( Chairman of Examiners ) and Dr. &NAME ( in charge of 3rd year labs . ) , though they would get the information later anyway . With every good wish , Yours sincerely , &NAME &NAME . &NAME wrote : <QUOTE> Dear Professor &NAME , I am writing to let you know that unfortunately I am unable to return to University at the beginning of this term .

SUBJECT: &NAME &CHAR &NUM " Calendars Dear interested parties , I would like to take this opportunity to inform you of the new &NAME &CHAR &NUM " calendar 's imminent publication .

To give you a brief insight , the &NAME &CHAR &NUM " calendar will contain scenes of all your favourite &NAME &CHAR characters - &NAME , &NAME , &NAME , &NAME and &NAME . Each month will focus on a specific character or theme and will include quotes for contemplation , provocation or amusement . Some may feel that we are slightly narcissistic , but I assure you that egocentricity is not one of our ( formally recognised ) flat virtues .

PLease direct any further inquires to our company administrative director , Miss &NAME &NAME .

SUBJECT: &NAME of the Jury ... I am back once more into the swing of life here in &NAME , and as usual , sleep patterns have been interrupted . What follows now is an explanation ... &NAME returned from his holiday with an incredibly annoying electronic mouse , which runs around , and laughs like a teletubby . Understandably , I hated it . &NAME was eating pizza &NUM night , and there were anchovies on it , which she did not like , understandably . As &NAME was not there , &NAME and &NAME came up with the idea that the only right thing to do would be to put the small fishes into &NAME 's clothes . Which they did . After much protestation on my part , and also of &NAME , the fishes were moved to &NAME 's shoes . After a while , ( well over &NUM hours ) I felt that I must tell &NAME about the fish . It would be unfair to him otherwise . The same day , I pinned the rodent onto the notice board by it 's tail , as a sign to other electronic creatures . That evening , I returned from a hard day at the department to find the rat , and a piece of paper inside my room . The paper was a note , from that detestable rodent ( &NAME ) informing me that if I continued to harm animals , something bad would happen to me . The only viable solution to this was to shoot the messenger , but as I do not own a gun , I was satisfied to unscrew the plastic back of the mouse . No wires were cut , as this was only another warning . Someone else ( &NAME , &NAME probably ) succeeded in damaging the internal organs of the beast . What a shame .

I of course questioned him , accusing him of setting up a " joke " . He told me that he was searching for my Due &NAME &NAME . I persisted in my questioning , but concluded , that he was telling the truth . How wrong I was about him . That evening , feeling very ill , I went to bed early . I heard a crackling noise from the top of my dresser , as if plastic bags were moving . I thought to myself , " I hope there is not a mouse in here . " ( I hate mice ) but then went to sleep .

I am not joking . &CHAR ) I object to being called ... insane , a liar , someone of depreciating estimation . ( &NAME ) &CHAR ) I did not &NAME . You have never seen me &NAME , and I am glad of that . &CHAR ) I am getting bored of being physically abused ( &NAME ) . You may be assured that it is only my natural kindness and my tendancy to burst out laughing when you attack me which prevents me from retaliating . &CHAR ) Our jokes are not primitive . This fact shall be engraved in stone before the year is out . &NAME &NAME wrote : <QUOTE> Put me out of my misery , shoot me now . Remove me from this list , your &NUM emails nearly put my " unread " in a few days to nearly &NUM ! ! ! And if the joke does n't involve rape alarms , it 's primitive . &NAME I 'm tempted to forward these to the &NAME &CHAR mailing list , but wo n't. &NAME saying it , but like &NAME , no offense , love you all , &NAME " T.S. &NAME " wrote : <QUOTE> I am back once more into the swing of life here in &NAME , and as usual , sleep patterns have been interrupted . What follows now is an explanation ... &NAME returned from his holiday with an incredibly annoying electronic mouse , which runs around , and laughs like a teletubby . Understandably , I hated it . &NAME was eating pizza &NUM night , and there were anchovies on it , which she did not like , understandably . As &NAME was not there , &NAME and &NAME came up with the idea that the only right thing to do would be to put the small fishes into &NAME 's clothes . Which they did . After much protestation on my part , and also of &NAME , the fishes were moved to &NAME 's shoes . After a while , ( well over &NUM hours ) I felt that I must tell &NAME about the fish . It would be unfair to him otherwise . The same day , I pinned the rodent onto the notice board by it 's tail , as a sign to other electronic creatures . That evening , I returned from a hard day at the department to find the rat , and a piece of paper inside my room . The paper was a note , from that detestable rodent ( &NAME ) informing me that if I continued to harm animals , something bad would happen to me . The only viable solution to this was to shoot the messenger , but as I do not own a gun , I was satisfied to unscrew the plastic back of the mouse . No wires were cut , as this was only another warning . Someone else ( &NAME , &NAME probably ) succeeded in damaging the internal organs of the beast . What a shame . It also came out that evening , that I had informed &NAME as to the fish . Threats were spoken unto me , particularly by &NAME , but her whimpering henchman , &NAME , also joined in. &NUM was left quaking in my brown shoes . Later that week , I went to go fencing , but returned early due to the fact that it was canceled . I entered the flat , and who should I see exiting my room , but &NAME . I of course questioned him , accusing him of setting up a " joke " . He told me that he was searching for my Due &NAME &NAME . I persisted in my questioning , but concluded , that he was telling the truth . How wrong I was about him . That evening , feeling very ill , I went to bed early . I heard a crackling noise from the top of my dresser , as if plastic bags were moving . I thought to myself , " I hope there is not a mouse in here . " ( I hate mice ) but then went to sleep . Early the next morning , I was woken by the sound of the evil mouse , amplified by about &NUM times , in my room . Understandably , as I was trying to recover from my cough , and desperately needed rest , I was saddened . Both &NAME and &NAME had very smug looks on their faces that morning . I am pleased to note , however , that the entire evilness of their plan did not bear fruit . The plan originally involved repeatedly waking me during the night , by the use of &NAME 's task manager on his computer . Fortunately for me , his is an incompetent oaf , and I was only woken , when &NAME manually sent it off in the morning . One of the fun things about fencing is that it is sometimes possible to say to your opponent , " I 'm gonna hit you on the head " and then you actually do it . Much more rewarding than not saying anything ! I was telling &NAME about this , and thought that I might worry him , by saying the " plans " I had for him ! I told him that I would enter his room &NUM night , and squirt his face with squirty cream . I even told him the night that this would be done . I would say now , that at this time I had no intention of actually doing such a thing . Later on that evening , I was in &NAME 's room with &NAME , and for some reason or another , I was purifying &NAME . This usually involves pain , but his has grown resistant to that , so " emotional battering " was taking place . This involved chucking his sterilized keys ( no kidding ) out the window into the contaminated world . At this &NAME flipped , and ordered me to " fetch them " . &NAME at this time signaled for me to change my key with &NAME 's, and this was the moment at which I started to think about actually getting some justice done . That night , I went to bed with &NAME 's key on my key ring , and mine on his . As &NAME is paranoid about germs entering his room at night , he always locks his door . The key was needed to gain access to his room . My plan was as follows , &CHAR ) wait until it is late ( or early ) &CHAR ) unlock &NAME 's door &CHAR ) place my sabre on the floor , as a sign that I was there , and &CHAR ) take a picture of &NAME asleep to prove it . My plan relied on the following assumptions : &CHAR ) &NAME would not know the number inscribed on his key &CHAR ) &NAME would not spend the night in &NAME 's bed . Unfortunately , neither of these assumptions were met . I know the latter one is shocking , but we need to face up to the truth . My plan went well , and I returned to bed , feeling very much like &NAME , after he cut the hem off of &NAME 's robe when he was sleeping . ( You can read about this in &NUM &NAME ) Unfortunately then next morning , the following revelations were brought to light . &CHAR ) Both &NAME and &NAME had known that I was going to do something that night . This , admittedly , was not surprising , as I had said that myself ! &CHAR ) Both &NAME and &NAME were awake when I took the picture of " &NAME " in his bed . &CHAR ) they had stolen my sabre . &CHAR ) and after my shower , locked me out of my room . evil people . &NAME of the jury , I ask you to bring down fire upon these &NUM sinners heads , and if not that , at least water balloons .

This is an actual petition , and 'signatures " will be lost if you drop the line . I do n't know if this is going to help but take &NUM minutes out of your life to do your part . &NAME , the government of &NAME , is waging a war upon women . Since the &NAME took power in &NUM , women have had to wear burqua and have been beaten and stoned in public for not having the proper attire , even if this means simply not having the mesh covering in front of their eyes . &NUM woman was beaten to death by an angry mob of fundamentalists for accidentally exposing her arm ( ! ) while she was driving . Another was stoned to death for trying to leave the country with a man that was not a relative . Women are not allowed to work or even go out in public without a male relative;professional women such as professors , translators , doctors , lawyers , artists and writers have been forced from their jobs and stuffed into their homes . Homes where a woman is present must have their windows painted so that she can never be seen by outsiders . They must wear silent shoes so that they are never heard . Women live in fear of their lives for the slightest misbehaviour . Because they cannot work , those without male relatives or husbands are either starving to death or begging on the street , even if they hold Ph. &NAME &NAME is becoming so widespread that it has reached emergency levels . There is no way in such an extreme Islamic society to know the suicide rate with certainty , but relief workers are estimating that the suicide rate among women must be extraordinarily high : those who cannot find proper medication and treatment for severe depression and would rather take their lives than live in such conditions . At one of the rare hospitals for women , a reporter found still , nearly lifeless bodies lying motionless on top of beds , wrapped in their burqua , unwilling to speak , eat , or do anything , but slowly wasting away . Others have gone mad and were seen crouched in corners , perpetually rocking or crying , most of them in fear . When what little medication that is left finally runs out , &NUM doctor is considering leaving these women in front of the president 's residence as a form of protest . It is at the point where the term " human rights violations " has become an understatement . &NAME have the power of life and death over their women relatives , especially their wives , but an angry mob has just as much right to stone or beat a woman , often to death , for exposing an inch of flesh or offending them in the slightest way . Women enjoyed relative freedom : to work , to dress generally as they wanted , and to drive and appear in public alone until only &NUM . The rapidity of this transition is the main reason for the depression and suicide ; women who were once educators or doctors or simply used to basic human freedoms are now severely restricted and treated as subhuman in the name of right-wing fundamentalist Islam . It is not their tradition or " culture , " but it is alien to them , and it is extreme even for those cultures where fundamentalism is the rule . Everyone has a right to a tolerable human existence , even if they are women in a Muslim country . If we can threaten military force in &NAME in the name of human rights for the sake of ethnic &NAME , citizens of the world can certainly express peaceful outrage at the oppression , murder and injustice committed against women by the &NAME . STATEMENT : In signing this , we agree that the current treatment of women in &NAME is completely UNACCEPTABLE and deserves action by &ORG and that the current situation overseas will not be tolerated . Women 's Rights is not a small issue anywhere , and it is UNACCEPTABLE for women in &NUM to be treated as subhuman and as so much property . &NAME and human decency is a fundamental RIGHT , not a freedom to be granted , whether one lives in &NAME or elsewhere . &NUM ) &NAME &NAME &NAME , &NAME City , CA , &NAME &NUM ) &NAME &NAME , &NAME &NAME , CA , &NAME &NUM ) &NAME &NAME , &NAME &NAME , CA &NAME &NUM ) &NAME &NAME , &NAME &NAME , CA &NAME &NUM ) . &NAME &NAME , &NAME &NAME , Ca . &NAME &NUM ) Kit &NAME , &NAME , CA &NAME &NUM ) &NAME &NAME , &NAME &NAME , CA &SMILEY &NAME &NAME , &NAME &NAME , CA &NUM ) &NAME &NAME , &NAME &NAME , CA &NUM ) &NAME &NAME &NAME , &NAME &NAME , CA &NUM ) &NAME &NAME , &NAME , CA &NUM ) &NAME &NAME , &NAME , CA &NUM ) &NAME &NAME , &NAME , CA &NUM ) &NAME &NAME , &NAME , CA &NUM ) &NAME &NAME , &NAME , CA &NUM ) &NAME &NAME , &NAME &NAME , CA &NUM ) &NAME &NAME , &NAME &NAME , CA &NAME &NAME &NAME , &NAME &NAME , CA &NUM ) &NAME &NAME ; &NAME &NAME , CA &NUM ) &NAME &NAME , &NAME &NAME , NY &NUM ) &NAME &NAME &NAME , &NAME , VA &NUM ) &NAME &NAME &NAME , &NAME City , &NAME &NUM ) &NAME &NAME &NAME , &NAME City , &NAME &NUM ) &NAME &NAME &NAME , &NAME City , &NAME &NUM ) &NAME &NAME &NAME , &NAME , &NAME &NUM ) &NAME &NAME &NAME , &NAME , &NAME &NUM ) &NAME &NAME &NAME , &NAME , &NAME &NAME &NAME &NAME &NAME , &NAME , &NAME &NUM ) &NAME &NAME , &NAME , IN &NUM ) &NAME &NAME , &NAME &NAME , CA &NUM ) &NAME &NAME " , &NAME &NAME , CA &NUM ) &NAME &NAME , &NAME &NAME , CA &NUM ) &NAME &NAME , &NAME &NAME , CA &NUM ) &NAME &NAME , &NAME Beach , CA &NUM ) &NAME &NAME , &NAME &NAME , CA &NUM ) &NAME &NAME , &NAME , CA &NUM ) &NAME &NAME , &NAME , CA &NAME &NAME &NAME , &NAME , CA &NUM ) &NAME &NAME , &NAME &NAME , CA &NUM ) &NAME &NAME . &NAME &NAME , CA &NUM ) &NAME &NAME , &NAME , CA &NUM ) &NAME &NAME , &NAME &NAME , CA &NUM ) &NAME &NAME , &NAME , &NAME &NUM ) &NAME &NAME &NAME , &NAME Park , CA &NUM ) &NAME &NAME , &NAME Park , &NAME &NUM ) &NAME &NAME , &NAME , &NAME &NUM ) &NAME &NAME , &NAME , &NAME &NAME &NAME &NAME , &NAME , NY &NUM ) &NAME &NAME &NAME , &NAME &NAME , &NAME &NUM ) &NAME &NAME , &NAME , &NAME &NUM ) &NAME &NAME &NUM ) &NAME &NAME , &NAME , &NAME &NUM ) &NAME &NAME , &NAME &NAME &NAME , &NAME &NUM ) &NAME &NAME , &NAME , &NAME &NUM ] &NAME &NAME , &NAME , &NAME &NUM ) &NAME &NAME , &NAME , &NAME &NUM ) &NAME &NAME , &NAME , &NAME . 5&SMILEY &NAME &NAME , &NAME , &NAME &NUM ) &NAME &NAME , &NAME , &NAME &NUM ) &NAME &NAME , &NAME &NAME &NAME &NUM ) &NAME &NAME , &NAME &NAME , &NAME &NUM ) &NAME &NAME , &NAME &NAME , &NAME &NUM ) &NAME &NAME , &NAME , &NAME &NUM ) &NAME &NAME &NAME , &NAME , &NAME &NUM ) &NAME &NAME , &NAME , &NAME &NUM ) &NAME &NAME , &NAME , &NAME &NAME &NAME &NAME , &NAME , &NAME , &NAME &NUM ) &NAME &NAME , &NAME , &NAME , &NAME &NUM ) &NAME &NAME , &NAME , Isle of &NAME , &NAME &NUM ) &NAME &NAME , &NAME , &NAME &NAME , &NAME &NUM ) &NAME &NAME , &NAME , &NAME &NAME .

SUBJECT: Our dearly beloved language Dear &NAME , &NAME and &NAME , I found this mildly amusing . Perhaps you will too ... Let 's face it English is a stupid language . There is no egg in the eggplant No ham in the hamburger And neither pine nor apple in the pineapple . English muffins were not invented in &NAME French fries were not invented in &NAME . We sometimes take English for granted But if we examine its paradoxes we find that &NAME takes you down slowly Boxing rings are square And a guinea pig is neither from &NAME nor is it a pig . If writers write , how come fingers do n't fing . If the plural of tooth is teeth Should n't the plural of phone booth be phone beeth If the teacher taught , Why did n't the preacher praught . If a vegetarian eats vegetables What the heck does a humanitarian eat ! ? Why do people recite at a play Yet play at a recital ? Park on driveways and Drive on parkways You have to marvel at the unique lunacy Of a language where a house can burn up as It burns down And in which you fill in a form By filling it out And a bell is only heard once it goes ! &NAME was invented by people , not computers And it reflects the creativity of the human race ( Which of course is n't a race at all ) That is why When the stars are out they are visible But when the lights are out they are invisible And why it is that when I wind up my watch It starts But when I wind up this observation , It ends . 
SUBJECT: Evolution and Creation Dear boys , At the risk of seriously annoying some people , I will only say this : I stand by all that I have said on this subject previously . I agree with the majority of what &NAME &NAME says . I am not blind to what science says . I just know that science is flawed and should not be trusted over and above our &NAME . I love you guys . I look forward to tea in your humble abode . I am bored with revision . The sun is shining as brightly as it did in &NAME . &NAME &NAME 's college library is creaky . So is this computer room . &NAME &NUM is a very steep lecture theatre . I 'd better go and stop saying random things . See you all later , &NAME PS - I am a Scandalous &NAME &NAME . &NAME - do you think I am predictable ? &NAME - do you think that I 've gone mad ? &NAME - it must be the sun ! &NAME ta ! 
SUBJECT: Re : &CHAR + &CHAR So , this is what it comes to . You are convinced , from your studies , that the earth is many millions ( possibly billions ) of years old . I do not have a problem with that , although I 'm no more convinced that it 's billions of years old than that it 's thousands of years old ( for reasons you can see below , if you read on ) . I do n't even think it 's that important , since we know so little about it anyway and its based on completely unkown assumptions - and what relevance does that period have to our life ? ? You are coming at science from a materialist point-of-view . If you come from a philosophical ( even modern ) view you would see that it is all speculation anyway . Have a look at &NAME 's problem of scientific induction for some extra reading on the issue . In terms of your comment about &NAME speaking to us through the rocks , I think you 're on slightly dodgy ground . The only thing you can tell from the rocks is that there was some HUGE time period involved . This does not tell us what &NAME 's plan for this period was , and what He was doing . That surprises me . Sir &NAME &NAME ( a strong Chrisitian and the father of modern physics ) put forward the hypothesis that his classical model of physics could explain the behaviour of the universe as we know it . In fact it cannot - but this was n't known until quantum theory was postulated . Does this mean that &NAME 's theory is invalid - no , but that in some major ways it had to be revised due to new findings . The same might well be true of your dating methods - in fact this is what science is all about . Do n't come at it from the view that you already know everything . In what way am I ignoring science ? I think that is a ridiculous and unfounded statement . If you 've got some convincing evidence for &NAME Evolution that outweighs the evidence against it then I 'm all ears , but I do n't see you coming up with any ! In terms of the age of the earth , I have not said either way , so how can that be an issue ? Flood geology ? You are asking me to argue against you in your own specialist subject field , so you cannot expect a full-blooded argument , just as I would not expect you to come up with an argument for the benefit of interface-modelling in &NAME ! But , if I believe that the &NAME is the inspired Word of &NAME , then I can see no reason to doubt that the flood was what is says it was . Look at this : &NUM &NAME &NUM ... [ &NUM ] First of all you must understand this , that scoffers will come in the last days with scoffing , following their own passions [ &NUM ] and saying , " Where is the promise of his coming ? For ever since the fathers fell asleep , all things have continued as they were from the beginning of creation . " [ &NUM ] They deliberately ignore this fact , that by the word of &NAME heavens existed long ago , and an earth formed out of water and by means of water , [ &NUM ] through which the world that then existed was deluged with water and perished . " all things have continued as they were from the beginning of creation . " - this is surely the theory of uniformitarianism ! The passage above is talking about people who say that there was no flood - that the world is as we know it now ( the present is the key to the past ) . This is not what the &NAME teaches . The &NAME teaches that " the world that then existed was deluged with water and PERISHED . " This is an argument against the assumptions that you base dating methods on . We CANNOT judge the past from the present because the world that existed before the flood ( if the flood happened then it happened within recorded history ) is NOT THE SAME as the world that now exists . This passage is from the New Testament - it is most certainly NOT metaphorical ! C ya " &NAME " T.S. &NAME " wrote : <QUOTE> &NAME wrote : <QUOTE> &NAME & friends , Interesting email .

Do n't get too upset about it . I think people are doing a great deal of harm , but they are usually willing to say &NAME is white when pressed . Saying that radiometric dating is unreliable is as silly as saying radio waves are unreliable ( when you change to channel &NUM , you usually get something with pictures and sound , unless there is a freak weather situation ) . Likewise dating . When several different decay schemes are used on the same rock , each with its own different half life , and give the same age ( concordance ) the method ca n't be said to be false . The half lives of some decay schemes are among the most precisely measured constants in physics - e.g. the &NAME clock which now replaces our world 's measurement of time . &NAME can go wrong - things such as weathering , or reheating rocks above their &NAME temperature ( which resets their clocks ) can occur - but they are the analog of the freak weather conditions in the TV example - understandable situations which can usually be checked . I also do n't believe our &NAME plays silly games with us . He would not give us the gift of scientific enquiry only to turn round and say - &NAME ha ! I only put those old-looking fossils there to fool you . I think a lot of the problems people with a young Earth viewpoint have stem with a fear that &NUM day science may pull the carpet of faith from under them . But if &NAME has made everything , science will never undermine what He 's done or prove He did n't do it ! Below I have lifted out bits of articles from the Christians in Science website .

SUBJECT: &NAME SIPPING VODKA A new priest at his first mass was so nervous he could hardly speak . After mass he asked the monsignor how he had done . The monsignor replied , " When I am worried about getting nervous on the pulpit , I put a glass of vodka next to the water glass . If I start to get nervous , I take a sip . " So the next Sunday he took the monsignor 's advice . At the beginning of the sermon , he got nervous and took a drink . He proceeded to talk up a storm . Upon his return to his office after mass , he found the following note on the door : &NUM Sip the Vodka , do n't gulp . &NUM There are &NUM commandments , not &NUM . &NUM There are &NUM disciples , not &NUM . &NUM &NAME was consecrated , not constipated . &NUM &NAME wagered his donkey , he did not bet his ass . &NUM We do not refer to &NAME &NAME as the late J.C. &NUM The Father , &NAME , and &NAME Ghost are not referred to as Daddy , Junior and the Spook . &NUM &NAME slew &NAME , he did not kick the shit out of him . &NUM When &NAME was hit by a rock and was knocked off his donkey do n't say he was stoned off his ass . &NUM We do not refer to the cross as the " &NAME &NAME " &NUM When &NAME broke the bread at the Last Supper he said,' Take this and eat it for it is my body . " He did not say " Eat me . " &NUM The Virgin &NAME is not called &NAME with the &NAME , " &NUM The recommended grace before a meal is not : Rub-A-Dub-Dub thanks for the grub , &NAME &NAME . &NUM Next Sunday there will be a &NAME pulling contest at &NAME &NAME 's, not a &NAME pulling contest at &NAME &NAME 's.

SUBJECT: &NAME 's birthday ( secret ! ) &NAME people , In &NUM weeks time there is a very exciting event taking place ... it 's &NAME 's birthday party ! ! ! But that 's not what I 'm emailing about ... the following week , on March 3rd , it is &NAME 's birthday ( and &NAME 's, of course ) . As he is up for the weekend for &NAME 's party but wo n't be around for his own , I thought it would be really nice if we could throw a little surprise birthday dinner on the Saturday . &NAME has kindly said we can have it at hers . I 've asked &NAME if we can have dinner with him , but have n't given anything away about it being for his birthday . It would be really nice if we could decorate &NAME 's living room , bring cards / pressies and generally make it feel like a party . I think he 'll really appreciate it as it 's his 21st but he 'll only get to celebrate with his family otherwise . Please let me know if you think this is a good idea , if you can come and also if you think anyone else should be invited . It will be after &NAME . &NAME and I will voluntarily stay home and miss &NAME to &NAME ( ! ! ! ) . Please do n't tell &NAME ! The only problem might be that he suggested that he might want to take us out as he wo n't be having a birthday party , so we might end up doing what he wants instead ... I 'll keep you posted , lots of love , &NAME &NAME is good ... All the time ! 
SUBJECT: A matter of increasing concern Dear &NAME , &NAME and &NAME , We have not yet given &NAME her 21st birthday present . It has been &NUM weeks since her birthday . When would it be convenient for everyone to do this at some point - imminently ? Also , you all owe me money - &pound; &NUM . Cheques are most acceptable , but if you must pay with cash I shall accept that . &NAME - thanks for your text message this morning . I am not used to receiving electronic blessings , but why not ? I am writing this email to you all because I have only had about &NUM emails in the last few days and they have all been very boring ; except for one , which was very interesting . Enjoy the rest of your days ( I mean today - but ever more too as I do n't think that came out quite right ) . &NAME 
SUBJECT: P.S. &NAME No &NAME , you have n't already paid me as you suggested earlier . I do n't know if you 've paid &NAME - you 'll have to ask her .

SUBJECT: Re : &NAME ( and &NAME & &NAME ) , So this guy is defending traditional geology against young-earthism . Well I do n't see any problem with his arguments , although I would question how much " &NAME " literature he 's actually read , because he skirts over a discussion of any details . However , he makes the point that if one holds the view that " the present is the key to the past " then one can date rocks back well into the millions of years . And it would appear that this is indeed so , although it is of course an " unscientific " view ( in the literal sense ) because we cannot observe what the universe was like thousands / millions of years ago . Well , you might say that we can " observe " it because we can study the rocks that date from that era , but that is clearly a circular argument . Personally I would not like to make any claims about the age of the earth , as I do n't see a particularly convicing argument either way , but I would like to make a couple of ( amateurish ! ) points : - presumably &NAME must have started everything off at some point , and since we do n't really know what state he started it off in , I do n't see how we can make valid assumptions about , for instance , how much of a given elemental isotope there was in the rock to begin with ( necessary for radiometric dating ) . - the fossil record does not appear to concur with what we would expect from a purely evolutionary theory of special origin . It shows gaps between species , and hardly any transitional forms ( for example , there has not been a single irrefutable transitional primate-human discovered in the fossil record ) . This suggest that if evolution did happen , things must have evolved very quickly between major special boundaries , but this contradicts the whole theory of evolution , because by definition things ca n't happen quickly . I only make these &NUM points because they relate to the geological record , and the age of the earth ; there are many other personal problems I could raise with evolutionary theory , but that is for another day . &NAME 
SUBJECT: Re : The point the guy was making , as far as I could see was not about evolution , but rather the age of the Earth . Secondly , just because assumptions are made , this does n't necessarily mean that they are wrong . With regards to radiometric dating , assuming that a rock started out with none of the daughter product is ver likely to be valid , as many of the products are only produced through radioactive decay , and when not trapped in rocks , are very easily lost . I am not really going out on a limb to say that radiometric dating does appear to work . How can I say this ? If you use different techniques , ie different isotope ratios , you will still arrive at roughly the same age , within the bounds of error for each technique . ( Usually within a few millions of years ) True , it is hard to say what the universe was like billions of years ago , and &NAME , ( The present is the key to the past ) really does n't apply to the formation of the Earth . Many people argue that the until &NAME &NAME , the processes , ie plate tectonics would have been much different . For example , the earth is the only terrestrial planet to have what we call continental crust , that is a light , bouyant crust . If you look at &NAME , which is still slightly active , although , compared to Earth , pretty much tectonically dead , the crustal rocks are very different to our continents , but similar to our oceans - the rock is basalt . The same is found on the moon . Questions being investigated include things like this , ie can we use the crusts of the other terrestrial planets as analoges for the early earth ?

SUBJECT: Re : Dear &NAME , &NAME and &NAME , ( I hope &NAME does n't mind all these emails ) Well , interesting emails . Even though the &NAME does n't have all the answers , it has all the answers we need and &NAME has all the answers - does anyone disagree ? Okay , I do n't really like arguing about evolution etc. from a non-biblical point of view as we can never be certain of anything that way , but just this once ... ! &NUM ) I would tend to say he is attacking " &NAME , rather than defending traditional geology etc. Look at the language he uses : " The scientific consensus is that the earth is of a vast age compared with " &NAME insists that the cosmos is only &NUM thousand years old . This is not the language of an objective critique of &NAME , as I surely do not need to point out . &NUM ) The fact that these fundamental concepts of geology were established before &NAME is of no relevance whatsoever . &NUM ) Traditional geology and evolution is a model used to explain the way the world exists at this point in time . In my opinion it does this rather badly . Now , you attack &NAME and ask for an alternative model . As &NAME mentioned , it would be advisable to read some &NAME literature . However , regardless of whether or not an alternative model is presented does not alter whether or not the first model is correct . &NAME taught egocentricity whether or not that was correct had nothing to do with whether or not &NAME had yet advanced the idea of heliocentricity . &NUM ) " Christians do need to challenge the belief that the ultimate controlling power in the universe is blind chance . There are many ways of doing this including raising the argument for design , pointing out the existence of " irreducible complexity and so on . Why could n't &NAME have used blind chance ? As I see it , we have already distanced him and diminished his role by attributing a large part our existence to slow-moving geological and evolutionary processes . Why stop there ? Blind chance is fundamental to the theory of evolution and accepting the major tenets of evolution without accepting the " god , so to speak , seems rather curious . &NUM ) " Within geology , these &NUM concepts are universally held ; I have never heard any professional geologist deny any of them . &NAME some &NAME literature .

My telephone number is &NUM &NUM &NUM and you are most welcome to call me as I will be very pleased to hear from you . I started my nine-week chemistry placement on Monday and it looks as though I am going to enjoy it &SMILEY The chemistry is interesting - and that ( of course ) is the main thing However , I have been getting up at 6am to catch a bus to &NAME and that is tiring ! Last night I lost my mobile phone and felt such a profound loss that I was quite shaken . I had left it on an express bus to &NAME and therefore despaired of all hope of ever seeing it again . Amazingly it was still on the bus when it got back into &NAME later that evening and I was reunited ! &NAME - &NAME you are enjoying your holiday in &NAME . &NAME - See you on Sunday evening ! &NAME - &NAME your placement is going well too . &NAME - Hello !

SUBJECT: [ Fwd : no chicken kievs this time ] Hey everyone - hope you 're all well . &NAME asked me to let you all know that he has gone into hospital again with another collapsed lung , ( the same as what happened in January ) . He was in a little pain on &NAME night , which was worse when he woke up on &NAME morning . He was doing fine and keeping calm and took the &NUM train home . When he went into hospital they found a &NUM collapse in &NUM lung ( not the one he had surgery on in January - that one 's fine ! ) - although still managing an amazing &NUM oxygen absorption ( ? ? ) according to his mum ! There were no beds in &NAME so he has gone into hospital in &NAME ( I think that was it ? ) . He is doing pretty well and has been given his own room , but is likely to be in hospital for a few days ( takes &NUM hrs to re-inflate the lung apparently ) . If people are confused about why this is happening again , I understand this is something that 's quite common in guys of his age and build - although I gather it 's not usually as bad as &NUM . One of the many things to thank &NAME for is a chance conversation that we had in the flat about &NUM weeks ago with &NAME &NAME ( who this has happened to &NUM or &NUM times I gather ) , in which he gave &NAME some advice and reassurance should it happen again - something &NAME and I were both relieved to remember yesterday morning ! so thanks ! Please pray for &NAME and send him messages , etc. He should be fine , but will obviously be pretty bored and fed-up being stuck in hospital for several days . If people have his home number and want to ring his mum directly she said they 'd be in after &NAME most days . Otherwise you 're welcome to ring &NAME &CHAR ( &NUM &NUM &NUM ) or get in touch with me ( &NUM 27732&SMILEY as I hope his mum will keep us updated ! Thanks everyone , &NAME &NAME If I 've forgotten anyone , will you pass this on please ?

SUBJECT: IMPORTANT - Monday event People , First of all , this mailing list does not have everybody in the CU on it , because it is the house party list ! Unfortunately we have n't had time to put together a comprehensive list , so please forward this message on to anyone you know in the CU who is not on the list . Thanks . OK , the main stuff : We have now ( hopefully - if it gets approved ) sent round the email advertising Monday evening . We would just like to clarify a couple of issues : &NUM We want to be as non-intimidating as possible to the people who come , so we ask you to bring a friend along if they want you to accompany them , but not to just come on your own . DO NOT FEEL GUILTY ABOUT NOT BRINGING PEOPLE - WE WANT PEOPLE TO COME BECAUSE THEY WANT TO , NOT BECAUSE THEY 'RE FORCED TO . &NUM During the event itself , we ask you to be sensitive and not jump in to answer questions that may be asked to the group , rather to let myself , &NAME or &NAME direct who answers the questions . That way we can be as clear as possible in the answers we give . &NUM Finally , again we appreciate you all , and hope that you are all well and excited . Keep it real , &NAME and &NAME

SUBJECT: Monday night Boys and Girls , As per , this is not a comprehensive email list - it is based on last term 's house party so please forward on to anyone you know who was n't on the house party ! Just a quick note about Monday night ... It was a fantastic time . The &NAME room was pretty much full-up . The people who came along had some pretty strong views and it was ( predictably ) quite a tiring occasion ! We VERY MUCH felt that &NAME was helping us , and that he had organised the whole thing pretty well really . It was a great opportunity for us to be honest and vulnerable with people , and we really think it was a step towards building relationships and sharing the GREAT love of &NAME . That 's all folks . See you soon . Thanks for you prayers , &NAME and &NAME

SUBJECT: Do Christians Annoy You ? Dear Everyone , this is the first attempt at sending an email to the new and revised &NAME 's CU mailing list , so if you 've got friends who are n't on it and want to be then please tell us ! We apologise that maybe not everyone feels that they have been entirely informed over the actual content of the 'Do Christians annoy you " discussion / forum , which took place in college during the Identity mission week . So hopefully the following will provide a relatively accurate account / overview of what was said and what objections were raised : Given that the week of distributing the Identity gospels had just come to an end , this issue was quite prevalent among those attending the discussion , and basically they were unhappy with it . The way that they perceived the booklets had been handed out had been similar to that of double-glazing salesmen or &NAME Witnesses knocking on your door , ie in your face , an annoyance , and an invasion of their privacy . They also mentioned a couple of isolated incidences which enhanced / intensified their ill-feeling towards the activities of the CU / Christians during the gospel distribution week . There was also general agreement amongst the people attending the discussion that in the weeks preceeding the mission the atmosphere in college had gone downhill and become pretty unpleasant . They felt like that there had been a big split between the Christians and non-Christians , and they put this down to the onset of mission week . They had also heard from various 2nd and 3rd years about alleged " hitlists " and the subversive activities of the CU , and wanted to know whether these rumours were true or not . Where appropriate , &NAME and &NAME apologised personally to the people present for any ways in which they have been hurt unnecessarily by the activities of the CU in the past . This led &NUM person to ask if anything was going to be done about it in the future ie , this person wanted to know if anything positive would result from the meeting . However , it was generally agreed that the fact representatives of the CU had sat down to listen to people , in order to find out where it 's going wrong in their eyes , was a positive step in itself . The remainder of the discussion involved other questions such as what it means to be a Christian , and what the implications are if you 're not . As can be expected in a fairly intense hour and a half long meeting there were many other points raised and I apologise if I have omitted some which ought to be have been recorded above , but hopefully this will give people an idea of what went on during the discussion . There were about &NUM / &NUM people who came to voice their objections and so it is unlikely that their views are entirely representative for the whole of college , and so that is the reason why we intend to produce a questionnaire before the end of term , to try and find out , if possible , what the majority of people in college think about the activities of CU with regard to gospel distribution and the mission week . Anyway , that 's about it , if anyone has anymore questions about this whole thing then please do n't hesitate to get in contact with us by email or just chatting to us , Take care and &NAME &NAME , &NAME and &NAME

SUBJECT: Next terms &NAME studies Hi everyone , &NAME that you are all having a good last week of term . If you get this email before your last college group session would it be posible for you to pass the following information on to your Bible study leaders or alternatively forward it to them .

SUBJECT: CU on the 7th of May Hello everybody , We 're very sorry about the lateness of this email and regret to inform people that CU will not be taking place tomorrow evening . The reason for this is due to the popularity of the &NAME &NAME 's boat social , which is unfortunately leaving at &NAME and seems to be taking a large proportion of the CU with it ! However , we have all been invited to &NAME " Celebration &NAME " in Chapel at &NAME , which is an informal prayer and worship time that finishes at &NAME , so there 'll be plenty of time afterwards to get ready for the evening . The discussion / presentation about &NAME relations , which was due to take place tomorrow , will now take place next week on the 14th of May - when hopefully as many people as possible will be able to attend . Once again we apologise for the inconvenience caused , see you all around and about , lots of love from &NAME and &NAME

All the best , &NAME and &NAME &NAME Could you please let anyone whom we have not included on this e-mail know of the change of circumstances . Thanks 
SUBJECT: Sacrifice . Blessed are those who are persecuted because of righteousness , for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.-Matt.5 : &NUM . Do you believe in &NAME ? It was a weird question to ask-probably because the person doing the asking held a semi automatic rifle in his hand and carried a cadre of explosives . Heretofore his target had been minorities and athletes , but he was now face to face with &NAME . For a long time she was a nobody , a simpleton . She attended her classes faithfully , was a good student , and basically kept to herself . That is , until she accepted &NAME into her heart as her &NAME and Saviour . People began to notice the changes in &NAME . She wore a perpetual smile , as though she had discovered the secret to life . By all accounts it was infectious . One of her friends at &NAME &NAME School in &NAME , &NAME , reported , " If you were feeling down , she would always give you an encouraging word . " Perhaps the killer had heard about her newfound faith , because he aimed his question-and his gun-right at &NAME &NAME . The scene was manic . Bodies lay strewn around the library , several missing faces and chunks of flesh . Screams of agony could be heard in the hallways . &NAME was headed toward a certain martyrdom . 'Do you believe in &NAME ? " he screamed . In an instant a strange assurance captivated &NAME as she looked into his eyes . " Yes , I believe in &NAME . " It would be her last words this side of heaven . The price of truth was her life . &NUM thousand years ago &NAME looked through prophetic eyes at the world around him . Surveying the scene and the trials that would overtake His people , He sought to calm their fears . " Blessed are those who are persecuted because of righteousness , for theirs is the kingdom of heaven . " That &NAME was willing to pay such a high price for her faith indicts many of us today . We shrink to tell people about the &NAME we serve . Yet &NAME is ready and willing to empower us to speak a word for Him . In the early days of the Christian movement many believers lost their lives because they would not renounce their faith . Their blood watered the tree of faith from which we now eat . The Christian faith is very real , and &NAME did not promise us an easy time , but He will be with us all the way . &NAME can and will use us now , but that involves real sacrifice , and a willingness to serve with all we have in this world . How many of us in our comfortable , western lifestyle are truly willing to give all we have to &NAME ? " Love the &NAME your &NAME with all your heart , with all your soul , with all your mind and with all your strength . " " Love your neighbour as yourself . " " There is no other commandment greater than these . " 
SUBJECT: Re : &NAME &CHAR &NAME 's &NAME &NAME ! They were very funny , you know before I met you I 'd have never put you down as a cleanliness type person but nowadays you , cleanliness and tidiness seem to go hand in hand , have you always had this reputation ? Do you think it 's deserved ? ! Anyway good luck with revision and those exams , no doubt I 'll be seeing you around some time soon , &NAME 
SUBJECT: Re : &NAME &CHAR &NAME 's Hi &NAME , Well , yes , since I came to uni I 've always had the reputation of cleanliness and tidyness . It all started last year when &NAME spotted me sterilising my doorhandles with boiling water ... I suppose that is a little strange , but who knows who 'd been using them ? The cleaners in college had no work to do when they came to my room , which seemed to please them immensely . And then , I suppose it kind of became my reputation in an unusual sort of way . At the end of first year &NUM ( perhaps rather stupidly ! ) wrote the following email ... &NAME 'S CLEANING CODE OF CONDUCT &NUM ) &NAME will not clean , or attempt to clean , any bedroom except his own unless at the express request of the relevant occupant . This especially applies to &NAME 's room - which &NAME would never dream of cleaning in a thousand years . ( Nightmares do n't apply ) &NUM ) &NAME will try his utmost not to be tempted to clean the communal areas constantly . He recognises this will be an uphill struggle , but ( naively ) hopes his natural strength of character and unwillingness to cause severe discomfort to his flat-mates will aid him in his difficult task . &NUM ) &NAME will attempt to refrain from transforming the flat into a surgically clean hospital-type environment before his fellow flat-mates arrive at the end of September . &NUM ) &NAME will promise to faithfully dispose of his surgical gloves , mask , biohazard suit etc. - Which he purchased for fulfilling the above task . &NUM ) &NAME will not buy any more than &NUM bottles of industrial strength bleach in any calendar month . &NUM ) &NAME will not stand sternly in the kitchen overseeing food preparation and hygiene , with a bottle of dettol in hand , when another flat-mate is cooking dinner . ( Except at personal request ) &NUM ) &NAME will only sterilise the flat door-handles with boiling water and domestos twice a term . &SMILEY &NAME will try not to tidy everything up , but will invariably fail . &NUM ) &NAME will refrain from allowing the 'Society of &NAME &NAME &NAME " , of which he is patron , to hold their monthly meetings in the flat . &NUM ) If &NAME is ever asked to do anything he does not wish to , he may relax these rules . ( &NAME ) Is anyone worried yet ? You have &NUM months to become so . What a nice way to end the year ! &NAME &NAME &NAME ( &NAME is &NAME ! ) Hope your revision is going well . All the best for the exams . &NAME 
SUBJECT: cu houseparty Hi everyone ! Hope you 're all out and enjoying this gorgeous weather - oops , oh yes , and working hard too ! &SMILEY This email is just to give you all an update on the CU Houseparty . There has unfortunately been a slight change of plan which we hope wo n't inconvenience any of you too much . Our speaker rang me this week to say that he wo n't be able to make Thurs 7th because he 's a part time policeman ( as well as a minister ! ) and has been recalled for the General Election on the 7th ! So we 've had to move the Houseparty back by a day , so that it 's now from * Monday 4th - Wednesday 6th June * . We hope everyone 's fine with that - let us know if there 's any problems . What 's great about &NAME Bay is that it 's really easy to get to by &NAME from &NAME , so if anyone wants to just come out for the day you 'd be more than welcome . We 'll also be asking for your cheques soon ( probably &NUM / &NUM pounds ) - we 'll let you know when . Lastly , please let us know if you have any suggestions or comments for this houseparty . This is a great opportunity to get away and spend some time in fellowship with each other , sharing &NAME 's gifts and getting to know each other and &NAME on a deeper level . We really want to know if you have any ideas for how we can best do that . Please also be praying for us and for the other people involved , as well as for the time we 'll be spending together as a group . Thanks for getting this far folks ! &NAME to see you all on Monday , if not before . &NAME and &NAME are going to spend some time talking to us about &NAME and it would be great if you guys could bring any questions or comments you have - now 's the time ! Have a lovely weekend ( if you can ) . For those of you with exams tomorrrow - hope they go well . Take care , &NAME &NAME , &NAME and &NAME

Also , while I 'm at it , the new ( and improved ? ) &NAME &NAME &NAME &NAME - is now on Saturday night after &NAME so be good to see you if you 're free . Thanks , &NAME ( at least this one wo n't be sitting on my desk for &NUM weeks ... ! ) Hello again treasured fellow &NAME member At &NAME on Saturday 9th June we 're having another &NAME in order to change the constitution and hopefully ratify &NAME &NAME to be the Christian union guest rep in the mission committee . As you will all remember , we need to amend Clause &NUM of the constitution so it will read : 'Members of all committees , College Representatives , Officers and Evangelistic Study Group Leaders shall be members of the &NAME with the exception of the Christian &NAME &NAME Representative for the year &NUM - &NUM who shall be ratified by the &NAME and shall record his or her agreement with the Doctrinal Basis of the &NAME as set out in Clause &NUM " Basically , for next year 's mission we need &NAME , a student worker , to help co-ordinate all the guests who will be helping us with our evangelism . We need to amend the constitution because &NAME is not a student worker . It is vitally important that enough members vote this time so please reply to me at &EMAIL filling in the options below : As a &NAME member : I wish to ratify / do not wish to ratify / wish to abstain from ratifying * ( delete as appropriate ) * the proposals made for amending the constitution I wish to ratify / do not wish to ratify / wish to abstain from ratifying * ( delete as appropriate ) * &NAME &NAME as CU guest rep .

Hey there folks - the end of term is rapidly approaching and &NAME and I want to be able to keep in touch with you all over the summer ( &NUM and &NUM / &NUM months ! ) - nothing too serious I promise ! What we 'd like to know , if possible is whether any of you have another email address you 'd prefer us to use , or if you intend to check your &NAME account using the webmail service : ( &WEBSITE ) On a related note , Leavers - do you have an email address ( hotmail or whatever ) we could have so that we could keep in touch with you all ? Also , you guys who are away abroad next year , the same applies ( although you could also use &NAME webmail ) . Let us know - otherwise we 'll assume that the &NAME address is okay . Also , anyone who 's not likely to be able to access email at all this summer , maybe you could tell us who would be able to easily pass on a message to you ? ( Let 's hope at least some of the above made sense . ) And finally , please please let us know if there 's anything you 'd like us to pray for in the summer - we 're trying to put a prayer letter together for everyone . Leavers - what are your plans ? Going abroad - where are you going ? what are you nervous about ? &NAME adventures - what ? where ? when ? etc. etc. We 'd love to hear from you ... See you all soon , &NAME bless , love &NAME and &NAME 
SUBJECT: new bible study leaders Hi guys - hope the exams all went to plan and life is groovy . &NAME and I want to thank you all for all your hard work leading bible studies and being available during this hectic term . You 've been great - thanks a lot everyone . We are finally getting around now to sorting out our plans for next year and as some of you will know we 're now on the look out for new bible study leaders . We 've got a few names already , but it seemed silly not to ask you all what ideas you had , especially as you have a much better idea of what the job entails . So , anybody you think would make a good fell group leader ? Anyone who could lead a helpful bible study ? We do n't just want the " obvious " names either - I 'm sure you know that it 's not always the loudest group members who 'd be the best bible study leaders . And obviously , commitment has to be a major factor . Please pray about it . We look forward to hearing from you all with your thoughts ( ? ! ) . You do n't have to limit it to your own fell group either ! We would of course keep anything you say confidential ( except of course we 'll use it to help us choose ! ) It would be great if we had a pretty good idea by the end of term what kind of names were coming out - so that we could talk to the people concerned if necessary . See you all soon , &NAME bless , love &NAME

I went last year and it was quite a good thing to go to - lots and lots of teaching , a chance to get to know some people from other colleges if you want to , bowling-type socials in the evening and the chance to sleep on a second year 's floor all for the bargain price of &pound; &NUM . So if any of you out there are interested in going , all you have to do is email me or &NAME and tell us you want to go , and then you just need to pay your &pound; &NUM on the thursday , simple ! If I do n't speak to all of you before the end of term , thank you all for putting up with these emails and for being a great bunch of people , this has been my most fun term so far this year !

SUBJECT: [ sj-cu ] &NAME excitement ? Sorry to keep filling up your inbox ( you know you love it really ) ! &CHAR quick last note about this week 's activities . For those who missed it , the &NAME Service was great last night , and &NAME &NAME was excellent . If there 's anyone who 'd like to hear him again this week and fancies staying a couple of extra nights in a 2nd year 's flat ( or else in college ) in beautiful ( &NAME , wet , windy ... ) &NAME - just come along to the CU Conference ! Let &NAME or I know so that we can give them a list for fire regulations , tell us if you need somewhere to stay ( or just hang out ) and pay your &pound; &NUM on Thursday morning . The Conference starts at 9.30am on Thursday - should be good . There are also still tickets for the ceilidh which you can buy on the door for &pound; &NUM . It 's in the &NAME &NAME &NAME ( &NAME 's) at 8pm on Wednesday , so if you 're not coming to the conference but you 're stuck in college on weds night with nothing to do , come and join us at the Christmas party .

SUBJECT: [ sj-cu ] Prayer Request Hi everyone - just a quick prayer request ... For those of you who know &NAME &NAME , he 's been in hospital near &NAME with a collapsed lung for about a week . His lung keeps inflating and deflating again , and so the hole in his lung ca n't heal . As a result of this , he ca n't go home . Obviously , please pray for him to be healed and well soon . But spending Christmas in hospital is never a good thing and so we 'd like to pray for him to be healed and out very soon indeed ! &NAME &NAME reminded me that : " it would be amazing , and quite miraculous , almost so much that I am scared to pray for it , but &NAME is BIG ! Very VERY BIG ! BIG TIME BIG ! So he can answer prayers . " &NAME guys , &NAME you are having a great holiday and staying well &NAME bless - love &NAME 
SUBJECT: [ sj-cu ] &NAME on &NAME &NAME &NAME Hello everyone , I hope you have all enjoyed the Christmas holidays and had fun over new year . This is just an update on &NAME 's condition - so that you know he has n't died or anything ! I think when &NAME &NAME sent this email &NAME was still in hospital but he is out of hospital now and recovering at home , but if you could all still pray for him to make as speedy a recovery as possible that would be great . See you all very soon , &NAME and &NAME " &NAME they opened &NAME up and had a look inside today and they found CHICKEN &NAME ! ! no they found a couple of blisters on his lungs . Therefore they stuck something over them so that the other &NUM , and one that already busted do n't bust again and then they did some roughing up of his lungs so that they stick to his chest wall . Basically he feels like he 's got flu but is actually much better . Well that 's what his VERY relieved sounding mother said . It should mean that the " thing " that was attached to &NAME , which bore a more than a passing resemblance to &NAME 's waterbottle , will not be necessary and &NAME will be restored to health . No aeroplane flying and no sport though . He probably wo n't be back at the start of next term as he will need a little time to recover . Pray for his speedy recovery . Also pray for his Mum and Dad &NAME they have found it very hard , particularly Mum . I am going to see &NAME tomorrow and if he 's well enough he will proceed to beat me at Downfall again . Never mind . If in the unlikely event you send anything to me I will pass it on . &NAME &NAME &NAME free to forward this as you wish . " 
SUBJECT: [ sj-cu ] &NAME &NAME &NAME Dear Everyone , for those of you who are members of &NAME , there is a blue sheet that has details of who the new college reps are going to be ( including our very own &NAME and &NAME ) as well as the extras on the exec plus a voting form type thing - if you want to pick yours up then we 'll leave them all in the M ( for &NAME ) pigeon hole .

SUBJECT: [ Fwd : Re : &NAME &NAME ] &NAME , Most of you probably wo n't get this email before &NAME &NAME tonight , but I thought I 'd send it anyway . See ya tonight , Love &NAME ( and &NAME ) Here is this week 's study passage , which really is only &NAME &NUM , but I think we have to look at the history behind this as well , in &NAME &NUM : &NUM . &NUM At &NAME there was a man named &NAME , a &NAME in what was known as the Italian Regiment . &NUM He and all his family were devout and God-fearing ; he gave generously to those in need and prayed to &NAME regularly . &NUM &NUM day at about &NUM in the afternoon he had a vision . He distinctly saw an angel of &NAME , who came to him and said , " &NAME ! " &NUM &NAME stared at him in fear . " What is it , &NAME ? " he asked . The angel answered , " Your prayers and gifts to the poor have come up as a memorial offering before &NAME . &NUM Now send men to &NAME to bring back a man named &NAME who is called &NAME . &NUM He is staying with &NAME the &NAME , whose house is by the sea . " &NUM When the angel who spoke to him had gone , &NAME called one of his servants and a devout soldier who was one of his attendants . &NUM He told them everything that had happened and sent them to &NAME . &NUM About noon the following day as they were on their journey and approaching the city , &NAME went up on the roof to pray . &NUM He became hungry and wanted something to eat , and while the meal was being prepared , he fell into a trance . &NUM He saw heaven opened and something like a large sheet being let down to earth by its &NUM corners . &NUM It contained all kinds of four-footed animals , as well as reptiles of the earth and birds of the air . &NUM Then a voice told him , " Get up , &NAME . &NAME and eat . " &NUM 'Surely not , &NAME ! " &NAME replied . " I have never eaten anything impure or unclean . " &NUM The voice spoke to him a second time , 'Do not call anything impure that &NAME has made clean . " &NUM This happened &NUM times , and immediately the sheet was taken back to heaven . &NUM While &NAME was wondering about the meaning of the vision , the men sent by &NAME found out where &NAME 's house was and stopped at the gate . &NUM They called out , asking if &NAME who was known as &NAME was staying there . &NUM While &NAME was still thinking about the vision , the &NAME said to him , &NAME , &NUM [ &NUM ] men are looking for you . &NUM So get up and go downstairs . Do not hesitate to go with them , for &NUM have sent them . " &NUM &NAME went down and said to the men , " I 'm the one you 're looking for . Why have you come ? " &NUM The men replied , " We have come from &NAME the &NAME . He is a righteous and God-fearing man , who is respected by all the Jewish people . &CHAR holy angel told him to have you come to his house so that he could hear what you have to say . " &NUM Then &NAME invited the men into the house to be his guests . The next day &NAME started out with them , and some of the brothers from &NAME went along . &NUM The following day he arrived in &NAME . &NAME was expecting them and had called together his relatives and close friends . &NUM As &NAME entered the house , &NAME met him and fell at his feet in reverence . &NUM But &NAME made him get up . 'Stand up , " he said , " I am only a man myself . " &NUM Talking with him , &NAME went inside and found a large gathering of people . &NUM He said to them : " You are well aware that it is against our law for a Jew to associate with a &NAME or visit him . But &NAME has shown me that I should not call any man impure or unclean . &NUM So when I was sent for , I came without raising any objection . May I ask why you sent for me ? " &NUM &NAME answered : " &NUM days ago I was in my house praying at this hour , at &NUM in the afternoon . Suddenly a man in shining clothes stood before me &NUM and said , &NAME , &NAME has heard your prayer and remembered your gifts to the poor . &NUM &NAME to &NAME for &NAME who is called &NAME . He is a guest in the home of &NAME the &NAME , who lives by the sea . " &NUM So I sent for you immediately , and it was good of you to come . Now we are all here in the presence of &NAME to listen to everything the &NAME has commanded you to tell us . " &NUM Then &NAME began to speak : " I now realize how true it is that &NAME does not show favoritism &NUM but accepts men from every nation who fear him and do what is right . &NUM You know the message &NAME sent to the people of &NAME , telling the good news of peace through &NAME &NAME , who is &NAME of all . &NUM You know what has happened throughout &NAME , beginning in &NAME after the baptism that &NAME preached-- &NUM how &NAME anointed &NAME of &NAME with the &NAME &NAME and power , and how he went around doing good and healing all who were under the power of the devil , because &NAME was with him . &NUM " We are witnesses of everything he did in the country of the Jews and in &NAME . They killed him by hanging him on a tree , &NUM but &NAME raised him from the dead on the third day and caused him to be seen . &NUM He was not seen by all the people , but by witnesses whom &NAME had already chosen--by us who ate and drank with him after he rose from the dead . &NUM He commanded us to preach to the people and to testify that he is the &NUM whom &NAME appointed as judge of the living and the dead . &NUM All the prophets testify about him that everyone who believes in him receives forgiveness of sins through his name . " &NUM While &NAME was still speaking these words , the &NAME &NAME came on all who heard the message . &NUM The circumcised believers who had come with &NAME were astonished that the gift of the &NAME &NAME had been poured out even on the Gentiles . &NUM For they heard them speaking in tongues [ &NUM ] and praising &NAME . Then &NAME said , &NUM " Can anyone keep these people from being baptized with water ? They have received the &NAME &NAME just as we have . " &NUM So he ordered that they be baptized in the name of &NAME &NAME . Then they asked &NAME to stay with them for a few days . &NAME &NUM &NUM The apostles and the brothers throughout &NAME heard that the Gentiles also had received the word of &NAME . &NUM So when &NAME went up to &NAME , the circumcised believers criticized him &NUM and said , " You went into the house of uncircumcised men and ate with them . " &NUM &NAME began and explained everything to them precisely as it had happened : &NUM " I was in the city of &NAME praying , and in a trance I saw a vision . I saw something like a large sheet being let down from heaven by its &NUM corners , and it came down to where I was . &NUM I looked into it and saw four-footed animals of the earth , wild beasts , reptiles , and birds of the air . &NUM Then I heard a voice telling me , Get up , &NAME . &NAME and eat . " &NUM " I replied , Surely not , &NAME ! Nothing impure or unclean has ever entered my mouth . " &NUM " The voice spoke from heaven a second time , Do not call anything impure that &NAME has made clean . " &NUM This happened &NUM times , and then it was all pulled up to heaven again . &NUM " &NAME then &NUM men who had been sent to me from &NAME stopped at the house where I was staying . &NUM The &NAME told me to have no hesitation about going with them . These &NUM brothers also went with me , and we entered the man 's house . &NUM He told us how he had seen an angel appear in his house and say , Send to &NAME for &NAME who is called &NAME . &NUM He will bring you a message through which you and all your household will be saved . " &NUM " As I began to speak , the &NAME &NAME came on them as he had come on us at the beginning . &NUM Then I remembered what the &NAME had said : &NAME baptized with [ &NUM ] water , but you will be baptized with the &NAME &NAME . " &NUM So if &NAME gave them the same gift as he gave us , who believed in the &NAME &NAME &NAME , who was I to think that I could oppose &NAME ? " &NUM When they heard this , they had no further objections and praised &NAME , saying , 'So then , &NAME has granted even the Gentiles repentance unto life . " &NUM [ &NUM ] &NUM early manuscript &NUM ; other manuscripts do not have the number . &NUM [ &NUM ] Or other languages &NUM [ &NUM ] Or in &NAME &NUM &NUM &NUM years later I went up again to &NAME , this time with &NAME . I took &NAME along also . &NUM I went in response to a revelation and set before them the gospel that I preach among the Gentiles . But I did this privately to those who seemed to be leaders , for fear that I was running or had run my race in vain . &NUM Yet not even &NAME , who was with me , was compelled to be circumcised , even though he was a Greek . &NUM [ This matter arose ] because some false brothers had infiltrated our ranks to spy on the freedom we have in &NAME &NAME and to make us slaves . &NUM We did not give in to them for a moment , so that the truth of the gospel might remain with you . &NUM As for those who seemed to be important--whatever they were makes no difference to me ; &NAME does not judge by external appearance--those men added nothing to my message . &NUM On the contrary , they saw that I had been entrusted with the task of preaching the gospel to the Gentiles, [ &NUM ] just as &NAME had been to the Jews. [ &NUM ] &NUM For &NAME , who was at work in the ministry of &NAME as an apostle to the Jews , was also at work in my ministry as an apostle to the Gentiles . &NUM &NAME , &NAME [ &NUM ] and &NAME , those reputed to be pillars , gave me and &NAME the right hand of fellowship when they recognized the grace given to me . They agreed that we should go to the Gentiles , and they to the Jews . &NUM All they asked was that we should continue to remember the poor , the very thing I was eager to do . &NUM When &NAME came to &NAME , I opposed him to his face , because he was clearly in the wrong . &NUM Before certain men came from &NAME , he used to eat with the Gentiles . But when they arrived , he began to draw back and separate himself from the Gentiles because he was afraid of those who belonged to the circumcision group . &NUM The other Jews joined him in his hypocrisy , so that by their hypocrisy even &NAME was led astray . &NUM When I saw that they were not acting in line with the truth of the gospel , I said to &NAME in front of them all , " You are a Jew , yet you live like a &NAME and not like a Jew . How is it , then , that you force Gentiles to follow Jewish customs ? &NUM " We who are Jews by birth and not &NAME sinners " &NUM know that a man is not justified by observing the law , but by faith in &NAME &NAME . So we , too , have put our faith in &NAME &NAME that we may be justified by faith in &NAME and not by observing the law , because by observing the law no one will be justified . &NUM " If , while we seek to be justified in &NAME , it becomes evident that we ourselves are sinners , does that mean that &NAME promotes sin ? Absolutely not ! &NUM If I rebuild what I destroyed , I prove that I am a lawbreaker . &NUM For through the law I died to the law so that I might live for &NAME . &NUM I have been crucified with &NAME and &NUM no longer live , but &NAME lives in me . The life I live in the body , I live by faith in the &NAME of &NAME , who loved me and gave himself for me . &NUM I do not set aside the grace of &NAME , for if righteousness could be gained through the law , &NAME died for nothing!'

SUBJECT: Re : [ Fwd : Re : &NAME &NAME ] Hello everyone , Sorry it 's taken me a few days to get round to emailing you - I have been sooooooo busy this week , but now I 'm at home for a few days , so I have a bit more time now .

Maybe &NAME will send you an email with it on , if you 're nice to him . Love &NAME

SUBJECT: [ sj-cu ] stuff ! ! Hello all ! I hope those of you at &NAME &NAME pn monday night found it enjoyable and encouraging ! ( Only &NUM months till the next one ! ) &NUM brief notices : &NUM ) The prayer meeting this week has been moved from Saturday to Thursday , &NUM 30pm in &NAME 's room , which is &NAME &NAME .

SUBJECT: [ sj-cu ] &NAME study Hello peeps ! &NAME and I thought we 'd try sending out the passage for the coming week 's bible study , so that you can read it in advance and come to the bible study ready to discuss it . So , here it is . ... &NAME &NUM ( a brilliant chapter ! and it picks up on what was preached at &NAME tonight , as well ! &SMILEY Freedom in &NAME 1It is for freedom that &NAME has set us free . Stand firm , then , and do not let yourselves be burdened again by a yoke of slavery . 2Mark my words ! &CHAR , &NAME , tell you that if you let yourselves be circumcised , &NAME will be of no value to you at all . 3Again I declare to every man who lets himself be circumcised that he is obligated to obey the whole law . &NAME who are trying to be justified by law have been alienated from &NAME ; you have fallen away from grace . 5But by faith we eagerly await through the &NAME the righteousness for which we hope . 6For in &NAME &NAME neither circumcision nor uncircumcision has any value . The only thing that counts is faith expressing itself through love . 7You were running a good race . Who cut in on you and kept you from obeying the truth ? 8That kind of persuasion does not come from the one who calls you . 9' &CHAR little yeast works through the whole batch of dough . " &NUM am confident in the &NAME that you will take no other view . The one who is throwing you into confusion will pay the penalty , whoever he may be . 11Brothers , if I am still preaching circumcision , why am I still being persecuted ? In that case the offense of the cross has been abolished . 12As for those agitators , I wish they would go the whole way and emasculate themselves ! 13You , my brothers , were called to be free . But do not use your freedom to indulge the sinful nature [ &NUM ] ; rather , serve one another in love . &NAME entire law is summed up in a single command : " Love your neighbour as yourself .' [ &NUM ] &NAME you keep on biting and devouring each other , watch out or you will be destroyed by each other . Life by the &NAME &NAME I say , live by the &NAME , and you will not gratify the desires of the sinful nature . 17For the sinful nature desires what is contrary to the &NAME , and the &NAME what is contrary to the sinful nature . They are in conflict with each other , so that you do not do what you want . 18But if you are led by the &NAME , you are not under law . 19The acts of the sinful nature are obvious : sexual immorality , impurity and debauchery ; 20idolatry and witchcraft ; hatred , discord , jealousy , fits of rage , selfish ambition , dissensions , factions 21and envy ; drunkenness , orgies , and the like . I warn you , as I did before , that those who live like this will not inherit the kingdom of &NAME . 22But the fruit of the &NAME is love , &NAME , &NAME , &NAME , kindness , goodness , faithfulness , 23gentleness and self-control . Against such things there is no law . 24Those who belong to &NAME &NAME have crucified the sinful nature with its passions and desires . 25Since we live by the &NAME , let us keep in step with the &NAME . 26Let us not become conceited , provoking and envying each other .

SUBJECT: [ sj-cu ] &NAME Hello ... I know it 's another e-mail from us but I 'll try to keep it brief ... Firstly , did you know that there 's a group of Christians who meet to pray for &NAME every week ? If you 've been to &NAME then it 's a great chance to reminisce with people about the " &NAME experience " , and to pray with people who share a passion for that continent . Anyone who 's been to &NAME or just has a heart to pray for &NAME is really welcome to come . Tomorrow we 're gonna be mainly praying for &NAME , as their vital presidential elections take place next weekend and they really need some prayer ! We meet on Mondays at 1pm in the main library , in study room &NUM , which is off the computer room on the second-from-top floor . I 'll be at the entrance to the library at &NUM tomorrow if anyone wants to come ... Secondly , you probably know that college communion is trying to be more student-friendly . The CU has been asked to lead the prayers at communion this coming Tuesday . So we 're looking for &NUM or &NUM willing volunteers to do just that - you can be people who normally go or people who 've never been before ( like me ! ) . If you 're interested please let me or &NAME know . &NAME &NAME 
SUBJECT: &NAME Here are the prayer points for this week ... &NAME - holiday job interview on this Friday at &NUM , for working at hospital playscheme . &NAME - praise &NAME that her mum is a lot better - all the work she needs to do before the end of term &NAME &CHAR - tiredness - work - very busy - &NAME - brother &NAME , who is a bit happier , but still needs prayer &NAME - work , and being able to concentrate on it &NAME - her dad , who is still looking for work , but is feeling more positive about it &NAME - that he will continue not being stressed about work ! &NAME - his grandad who is ill , and the whole family PETE - he has resigned from the &NAME exec , to try and sort out what he believes and thinks . Pray that he will be able to talk to people who are wise , who can help him with his questions . JUSTIN - feeling very alone at the moment , not seeming to be getting better . Also now got a stomach bug . New Relationships - pray for the new couples in college , that they will be a good witness in their relationships , and they will build friendships , and be sensitive to others , and sensible , etc. 
SUBJECT: Passage and &NAME Hi &NAME ... Here is the passage for this week . We 're looking at Chapter &NUM . There is a link below to the commentary on this passage which might also be good to look at . Commentaries are great because they put things in perspective and context . So if you could read at least the passage before hand ( whether online or in your Bible , &NAME ! ) and if you want the commentary too , then we can bash around some ideas and thoughts about what is being said . I hope your quiet times are going well as well . Please pray for mine , as I have n't been able to concentrate very well . You guys are a great group ! Lots of love , &NAME &WEBSITE &NAME &NUM Doing &NAME to All 1Brothers , if someone is caught in a sin , you who are spiritual should restore him gently . But watch yourself , or you also may be tempted . 2Carry each other 's burdens , and in this way you will fulfill the law of &NAME . &NAME anyone thinks he is something when he is nothing , he deceives himself . 4Each one should test his own actions . Then he can take pride in himself , without comparing himself to somebody else , 5for each one should carry his own load . 6Anyone who receives instruction in the word must share all good things with his instructor . &NAME not be deceived : &NAME cannot be mocked . A man reaps what he sows . 8The &NUM who sows to please his sinful nature , from that nature [ &NUM ] will reap destruction ; the one who sows to please the &NAME , from the &NAME will reap eternal life . 9Let us not become weary in doing good , for at the proper time we will reap a harvest if we do not give up . 10Therefore , as we have opportunity , let us do good to all people , especially to those who belong to the family of believers . Not Circumcision but a New Creation 11See what large letters I use as I write to you with my own hand ! 12Those who want to make a good impression outwardly are trying to compel you to be circumcised . The only reason they do this is to avoid being persecuted for the cross of &NAME . 13Not even those who are circumcised obey the law , yet they want you to be circumcised that they may boast about your flesh . 14May &NUM never boast except in the cross of our &NAME &NAME &NAME , through which [ &NUM ] the world has been crucified to me , and &NUM to the world . 15Neither circumcision nor uncircumcision means anything ; what counts is a new creation . 16Peace and mercy to all who follow this rule , even to the &NAME of &NAME . 17Finally , let no one cause me trouble , for &NUM bear on my body the marks of &NAME . 18The grace of our &NAME &NAME &NAME be with your spirit , brothers .

SUBJECT: [ sj-cu ] Exciting international things ! Hi guys ! As promised , here is &NAME and &NAME 's report about their trip to &NAME in the summer . There 's also a note from &NAME &NAME who runs the &NAME prayer group . &NAME reading ! &NAME and &NAME Hi ! I run a prayer group for anyone who has an interest and a heart for praying for nations in &NAME . You may have taken a gap year and would like to continue praying for people you met . So here 's how ! We get together on Tuesday lunchtimes from 1-2pm in &NAME &NAME Chapel . We chat about things going on there and share our love of different places and then pray lots ! Its informal and a good chance to build new friendships . We 'd love to see our group grow and see &NAME answer our prayers and change lives in nations that are in great need of him . Please come along &NAME bless zannax Latin Link trip to &NAME &NUM &NAME and &NAME To be honest , I really do n't know where to start in writing this report on my trip to Ecuador-the people ? The places ? The work ? The fun ? It would take many hours and many , many pages to tell you all about it but I 'd still fail . I do n't think I would ever be able to fully share what I saw and experienced there , the task is too huge and complex ( as such things always are ) but I 'll try . Our real project or should I say focussed aim was to build a Sunday school for a church in &NAME &NAME &NAME &NAME &NAME , a new and rapidly growing city South East of Quito the capitol . We arrived at the church on our first day expecting to find virgin soil just waiting to be dug , but why make it easy when difficult is so much more fun ! The &NUM , &NUM and a half metre square foundation holes could not be dug until the concrete had been cracked through . This was done by bashing with a heavy iron &NAME until you got little cracks which then after many hours turn into a hole you can put your hand through . The digging itself could actually be quite fun and it gave me a real sense of achievement knowing that I could hide in my hole if the need ever arose ! However , when the hole got so deep that I had trouble reaching to get the soil out I began to wonder how I was going to get out ! The most sophisticated piece of equipment in &NAME is , wait for it' the spade ( the wheel &NAME was a close contender but due to its persistent malfunctioning was disqualified ) so we spent many hours of fun pretending to be a cement mixers . It also meant that was had to make all the iron supports-sawing , bending and quilting as we affectionately named it ( twisting wire to join the poles ) . It was while quilting we discussed , debated , argued , sang and most definitely bonded ! Despite it being really tough work , &NAME really blessed us on the building site particularly with the relationships with our maestros . He also really protected us- the only accident being a very funny ( although highly embarrassing ) incident when I fell down the well When we were n't building , we tried to get involved with the youth as much as possible , but in all honesty they were so fascinated by the strange gringos that we did n't really have much choice ! Each Tuesday we ran after school groups for &NUM year olds , in which we 'd play silly games and do a sketch based around a Bible passage which we 'd then get them to learn . The children 's enthusiasm , passion and attentiveness to the verses we asked them to learn , our plays they spontaneously performed for us and most of all &NAME was both humbling and hugely encouraging . Each day , at &NUM o' clock on our crawl home from work , children from the local houses would rush out to meet us which prompted us to start a 2nd club held on the street . The most disastrous club we ran may actually turn out to be the most successful . It was our last week , and so taking into account previous weeks we judged that a slightly more challenging and mature approach was needed . However , when &NUM o' clock came only one of our usual girls was there , so we sat down and prayed as we always did but we also prayed that Hoard loads of children from the poor areas [ who the week before we 'd given out clothes to ] that had never been to church before would come . As we finished praying we looked up to see &NUM children aged between &NUM and &NUM flood through the gates . EVERYTHING we planned went wrong and our impromptu play was a shambles ( due to our lack of Spanish we started acting a completely different part of the prodigal son to that which was being read out ! ) . However , in the midst of chaos , &NAME was there controlling and showing his power despite and through our human failings . And that was exactly what is was like all the way through our trip- when our money did n't come through from &NAME , our water did n't work in the toilet which although very annoying ( and smelly ! ) at the time meant we did n't have to pay our deposit . The day the toilet was fixed , our money arrived . Whenever someone felt a bit ill , prayer restored their health so despite guarantees that we would all get ill at some point &NAME bless us amazingly all the time . We felt his presence continually and his hand always guiding us . Whenever things were tough or went wrong or we felt discouraged , His spirit was there up lifting us and helping us forward . I want to end by saying my trip was a life changing experience , but was it really ? It should have been , I know that , but how much it actually affects my day to day life now is shamefully questionable . &NUM week , another team member and I gave out tickets to poor families so they could come to the church and collect clothes and toys . The poverty there was so shocking it was practically indescribable . &NUM people living in &NUM house the size of my ( small ) dining room at home , the only water coming from a stagnant , mosquito breeding stream . And yet despite all this I complain about our cramped flat that is n't big enough to have a party in ! &NUM time when we had a weekend off , we went with the missionary family to the beach . &NUM evening we sat in the town square and ate chicken and chips . We had too much to finish so we found a group of shoe shine boys and gave them our leftover . The look on one of the boy 's faces , I vowed to remember forever , mixture of disbelief and sheer joy that someone would give them food or what we would consider scraps that we did n't want or need . It was so humbling . My time in &NAME taught me many things ; perseverance , &NAME , compassion , courage to be challenged but one of the most important things , which I need continual reminding about is how exceptionally blessed we all are in so many ways . It 's not about trying to fit the Ecuadorian lifestyle into ours but it is being truly grateful and thankful for what we do have both physically and spiritually . And , most of all giving praise back to the only one who deserves it .

SUBJECT: Re : [ Fwd : Re : &NAME &NAME ] &NAME , here 's the passage . Have a read through it , either now or later , so that when we come to it on Monday we have a basic idea of what is going on . What might also be good is to sit down sometime and just have a read through of the whole letter . Hope you are all well . &NAME , cause it 's a beautiful day ! &NAME &NAME &NUM &NUM You foolish &NAME ! Who has bewitched you ? Before your very eyes &NAME &NAME was clearly portrayed as crucified . &NUM I would like to learn just &NUM thing from you : Did you receive the &NAME by observing the law , or by believing what you heard ? &NUM Are you so foolish ? After beginning with the &NAME , are you now trying to attain your goal by human effort ? &NUM Have you suffered so much for nothing -- if it really was for nothing ? &NUM Does &NAME give you his &NAME and work miracles among you because you observe the law , or because you believe what you heard ? &NUM Consider &NAME : " He believed &NAME , and it was credited to him as righteousness .' [ &NUM ] &NUM &NAME , then , that those who believe are children of &NAME . &NUM The Scripture foresaw that &NAME would justify the Gentiles by faith , and announced the gospel in advance to &NAME : " All nations will be blessed through you .' [ &NUM ] &NUM So those who have faith are blessed along with &NAME , the man of faith . &NUM All who rely on observing the law are under a curse , for it is written : " &NAME is everyone who does not continue to do everything written in the Book of the Law .' [ &NUM ] &NUM Clearly no one is justified before &NAME by the law , because , " The righteous will live by faith .' [ &NUM ] &NUM The law is not based on faith ; on the contrary , " The man who does these things will live by them .' [ &NUM ] &NUM &NAME redeemed us from the curse of the law by becoming a curse for us , for it is written : " &NAME is everyone who is hung on a tree .' [ &NUM ] &NUM He redeemed us in order that the blessing given to &NAME might come to the Gentiles through &NAME &NAME , so that by faith we might receive the promise of the &NAME . &NUM Brothers , let me take an example from everyday life . Just as no one can set aside or add to a human covenant that has been duly established , so it is in this case . &NUM The promises were spoken to &NAME and to his seed . The Scripture does not say " and to seeds , " meaning many people , but " and to your seed,' [ &NUM ] meaning &NUM person , who is &NAME . &NUM What I mean is this : The law , introduced &NUM years later , does not set aside the covenant previously established by &NAME and thus do away with the promise . &NUM For if the inheritance depends on the law , then it no longer depends on a promise ; but &NAME in his grace gave it to &NAME through a promise . &NUM What , then , was the purpose of the law ? It was added because of transgressions until the Seed to whom the promise referred had come . The law was put into effect through angels by a mediator . &NUM A mediator , however , does not represent just &NUM party ; but &NAME is one . &NUM Is the law , therefore , opposed to the promises of &NAME ? Absolutely not ! For if a law had been given that could impart life , then righteousness would certainly have come by the law . &NUM But the Scripture declares that the whole world is a prisoner of sin , so that what was promised , being given through faith in &NAME &NAME , might be given to those who believe . &NUM Before this faith came , we were held prisoners by the law , locked up until faith should be revealed . &NUM So the law was put in charge to lead us to &NAME [ &SMILEY that we might be justified by faith . &NUM Now that faith has come , we are no longer under the supervision of the law . &NUM You are all sons of &NAME through faith in &NAME &NAME , &NUM for all of you who were baptized into &NAME have clothed yourselves with &NAME . &NUM There is neither Jew nor Greek , slave nor free , male nor female , for you are all one in &NAME &NAME . &NUM If you belong to &NAME , then you are &NAME 's seed , and heirs according to the promise . &NUM [ &NUM ] Gen . &NUM : &NUM &NUM [ &SMILEY Gen . &NUM : &NUM ; &NUM : &NUM ; &NUM : &NUM &NUM [ &NUM ] &NAME . &NUM : &NUM &NUM [ &NUM ] &NAME . &NUM : &NUM &NUM [ &NUM ] &NAME . &NUM : &NUM &NUM [ &NUM ] &NAME . &NUM : &NUM &NUM [ &NUM ] Gen . &NUM : &NUM ; &NUM : &NUM ; &NUM : &NUM &NUM [ &NUM ] Or charge until &NAME came Lifted from an e-mail by &NAME &NAME ... Here 's just a quick explanation about the uses of curses in the &NAME so hopefully verse &NUM will make more sense . Being cursed is an inevitable consequence of sin ... &NAME &NUM &NUM " &NAME is the man who carves an image or casts an idol--a thing detestable to the LORD , the work of the craftsman 's hands--and sets it up in secret . " Then all the people shall say , " Amen ! " &NUM " &NAME is the man who dishonors his father or his mother . " Then all the people shall say , " Amen ! " &NUM " &NAME is the man who moves his neighbor 's boundary stone . " Then all the people shall say , " Amen ! " &NUM " &NAME is the man who leads the blind astray on the road . " Then all the people shall say , " Amen ! " &NUM " &NAME is the man who withholds justice from the alien , the fatherless or the widow . " Then all the people shall say , " Amen ! " &NUM " &NAME is the man who sleeps with his father 's wife , for he dishonors his father 's bed . " Then all the people shall say , " Amen ! " &NUM " &NAME is the man who has sexual relations with any animal . " Then all the people shall say , " Amen ! " &NUM " &NAME is the man who sleeps with his sister , the daughter of his father or the daughter of his mother . " Then all the people shall say , " Amen ! " &NUM " &NAME is the man who sleeps with his mother-in-law . " Then all the people shall say , " Amen ! " &NUM " &NAME is the man who kills his neighbor secretly . " Then all the people shall say , " Amen ! " &NUM " &NAME is the man who accepts a bribe to kill an innocent person . " Then all the people shall say , " Amen ! " &NUM " &NAME is the man who does not uphold the words of this law by carrying them out . " Then all the people shall say , " Amen ! " As we all sin we all deserve to be cursed . &NAME wants us to be free to have a relationship with Him and so &NAME took the curse for us . ... &NAME &NUM &NUM Be sure to bury him that same day , because anyone who is hung on a tree is under &NAME 's curse . &NAME &NUM &NUM &NAME redeemed us from the curse of the law by becoming a curse for us , for it is written : " &NAME is everyone who is hung on a tree .

I think I will ) &NAME is good and has blown me away with his faithfulness , He 's quality . Anyway a couple of quick things . &NAME and I wondered if instead of a proper CU on the 2nd &NAME ( our last one before christmas due to the &NAME service ) everyone would like to have a chance of fufilling there lifelong fantasy of being part of &NAME On Ice by going &NAME SKATING at the gala theatre . If we can get a hundred people we can book the whole place out and have it all for &NUM hours ( &NUM ) . The cost is &pound; &NUM per head and as &NAME told me on the phone very excitidly , you get a free drink ( in the words of &NAME " Get In " ) We need to book it , but there is no point if loads of you think its a wrong idea or wouldnt wanna come . So what we need is for you to email us if you DONT WANT TO COME . That way we can get an idea of rough interest . Let us know &SMILEY Secondly as some of the second years and third years will know &NAME &NAME is not with us this year &NAME she is working for &NAME down in the &NAME village . She says hello and wants to hear all the news ( purely on a prayerful interest level ) so email her ( she can still access her &NAME account . IF you dont know her , who cares , email her anyway it will be good to make a new friend . her email is &EMAIL Lastly below please find a message abour the diccu houseparty - last date is saturday at &NAME - love &NAME And &NAME thought I would give a relevant fact today - when they first performed &NAME on ice they had to treat the performer who was goofy for frost bite on his nose .

You can send them by internal mail to &NAME &NAME , post them ( to &NUM &NAME &NAME &NAME &NAME 4DE ) , give the forms and deposits to me at &NAME or email me the details by replying to this email ( and sending it to &EMAIL ) .

SUBJECT: &NAME &NAME Breakfast ! Hi everyone ! Hope youre all ok and not too snowed under with work ... This Monday is our last Monday &NAME study this term coz we 're all going ice skating the week after and then its the student carol service on the 9th .

Either at 8: 30am ish so as people can get off to &NAME afterwards if they want , or we could make it brunch at about 10am , and people can go to &NAME in the evening . Can you let me know whether youd prefer the early breakfast idea or the brunch &NUM , and also if you can make 8th &NAME or not . &NAME , thats about all - and I dont recall essays being mentioned in the &NAME so they cant be that important after all ... See you on Monday Take care , &NAME .

This is just to let you lkmow whats going on tmorrow night - were going to meet in THE WALLIS ROOM at &NUM : &NUM , I know this means the livers out have to come in , but its easier if we all arrive as a big group to the monsterous rink of fun . We are ice skaitng from &NUM , so we should have a lot of fun , and in the words of my wonderful mother " wrap up warm , the ice is &NAME " If you 've said youre comimg can you please make every effort to come and bring your &NUM quid , there are still loads of spaces left ( so come and bring people even if you havent signed up ) and if people dont come CU ( and my credit card ) are going to be in massive debt &NAME we have had to pay the amount up front .

SUBJECT: [ sj-cu ] Deck the halls with bows of &NAME Hi guys Firstly thanks so much to you guys who turned up for the wonders of the ice skating and made it not a silent night . Everyone seemed to have a quality time and it was great to see people having a bit of a laugh . Special metion goes to &NAME presidente &NAME , for doing &NAME the Eagle on ice ( if you dont get that , I 'm obviously getting old ) and &NAME for wiping out spectacularly in the brightest pink flares I have ever seen . Also as &NUM ships go sailing by apologies about the lack of mulled wine and hot chocolate and the half on half off thing . The company recieved a nice arsey email from me this moring so we wait with baited breath doubtless the herald angels will sing . Now onto more important things . It is time to get a bit christmassy with Misses &NAME and &NAME ( crap joke I know ) and to help you this coming monday there is a wonderful carol service in &NAME Cathedral put on by the lovely DICCU' ites . It was awesome last year &NAME the cathedral was full and in fine voice . There is a little talk about the meaning of christmas so its great to invite anyone along to , not exclusive in anyway open to everyone ( including &NAME 's mummy and daddy ) . We thought it would be nice if people want to go as a group , to go together so are going to meet at &NUM : &NUM in reception . We will leave fairly prompt . If you wanna come under your own steam thats cool , the options there if you want it . Afterwards there will be mince pies etc. . in &NAME hall so come back like we &NUM kings and eat them . which leads me onto saying if you wanna donate some mince pies then take them to &NAME or give them to someone who is going , or chuck them away in a manger or in &NAME hall monday night . &NAME that 's all folks gotta go to royal davids city for tea If youre really bored you can see how many &NAME titles I have got into the above email . ... yes I know its not taxing but humour me ( answer at bottom ) And the fact today is that for some unknown reason , a ducks quack doesnt echo . fascinating . . ... keep going for the answer In the words of delirious " [ you gotta ] go deeper " nearly there &NUM I think &SMILEY 
SUBJECT: [ sj-cu ] Mince pies and houseparties Hello ! ! ! This is an appeal for a few helpers to help out with serving the refreshments after the CU carol service on Monday night . It does n't involve doing anything beforehand , just turning up afterwards in &NAME Hall to put out mince pies , take them round the hoards of hungry carol singers , and help collect up the rubbish afterwards . If you 'd like to help out , please let me know &NAME ! And another thing , if you 're going on the &NAME houseparty in January , there 's a message below from the houseparty organisers that you need to reply to ... ! Love &NAME Hi guys . I 'm on the houseparty committee and I 'm trying to organise transport and accommodation . Out of the &NUM people that are going , only &NUM or so have indicated that they either have room in their house or that they need accommodation for the 15th and / or 18th of January . Consequently , I would be really grateful if you could send an E-mail to either &NAME or myself letting us know : &NUM ) Who you want to share a cabin with ( &NUM or &NUM people ) &NUM ) If you have any space in your house on the 15th or 18th &NUM ) If you need somewhere to stay or leave luggage on the 15th or 18th &NUM ) How you are planning on travelling up to &NAME in time for the houseparty .

It is my pleasure to inform you of an &NAME coming up on Saturday 1st &NAME at 7pm at &NAME &NAME church . This is to hopefully change the name of Programme Secretary to &NAME &NAME Co-ordinator and to ratify the exec 's proposals for next year 's exec committee and college reps . In order to change the name , we have to change our constitution ( as outlined below ) and so half our members must vote . It is therefore essential that if you cannot attend , you please vote either by returning the slip below to me , or alternatively by e-mail - as soon as possible . The agenda for the &NAME will be : ( &NUM ) Apologies for absence ( &NUM ) Minutes of the previous meeting proposed as read . ( &NUM ) Matters arising from the minutes . ( &NUM ) Announcements from the chair and questions of officers ( &NUM ) Ratification of amendment to the constitution ( &NUM ) Ratification for the proposals for exec and reps positions ( &NUM ) Any other business ( The deadline for &NAME is &NAME Friday 31st January ) . Explanation of the constitution change : Clause &NUM of the constitution currently reads , The Executive Committee shall consist of [ names each of the positions ] Programme Secretary The exec propose to change this to , The Executive Committee shall consist of [ names each of the positions ] &NAME &NAME &NAME The reason this has been decided is that &NAME studies form a very important part of &NAME college groups and their organisation has become the main role of the Programme Secretary . Therefore we as an exec feel that this is where the emphasis in the title should be and hope that you will support us in this . Please do vote if you ca n't come to the meeting then email me ! &NAME : &NAME : &NAME Secretaries : &NAME &NAME ( &NAME ) and &NAME &NAME ( &NAME ) Prayer Secretary : &NAME Person ( &NAME ) Secretary : &NAME &NAME ( &NAME ) International Secretary : &NAME &NAME ( &NAME ) &NAME study co-ordinator : &NAME &NAME Treasurer : &NAME &NAME ( &NAME ) College &NAME . : &NAME - &NAME &NAME and &NAME &NAME &NAME &NAME &NAME &NAME &NAME &NAME and &NAME &NAME &NAME &NAME &NAME &NAME &NAME &NAME and &NAME &NAME &NAME &NAME &NAME and &NAME &NAME &NAME and &NAME &NAME &NAME and &NAME &NAME &NAME - &NAME &NAME and &NAME &NAME &NAME &NAME &NAME and &NAME &NAME &NAME &NAME &NAME and &NAME &NAME &NAME &NAME &NAME &NAME and &NAME &NAME University - &NAME &NAME and &NAME &NAME If you do n't know who any of these people are , please ask their college rep or someone on exec . Likewise , if you have any questions about why these people were chosen , or would like to make an objection please speak to or e-mail myself or someone on exec &NAME . It is important that everyone has the opportunity to have a say in who will be running &NAME next year . If you are n't able to come , PLEASE use the slip on the back of this letter and put it in internal mail OR EMAIL so that your vote can still be counted . ( This helps us as well as it means we are more likely to be quorate ! ) . Apologies need to reach me by 7pm on Friday 31st January . If anyone has any questions or would like to see the constitution please get in touch with any member of the exec as soon as possible . &NAME &NAME ( &NAME Secretary ) I ____________________________ ( block capitals ) wish to give apologies for my absence from the &NAME &NAME to be held on Saturday the 1st &NAME &NUM .

SUBJECT: Hi &NAME ! It was good to talk to you a few days ago . I hope you 're having an enjoyable time seeing various people around the country . I now have the rest of the week off work since the harvest is progressing rather slowly this year - no barley for me to analyse ! This has been a busy week , I 've only worked &NUM days Well , it gives me a chance to catch up on some relaxation ( and , of course , chemistry - naturally ) . Did I ask you when I spoke to you on the telephone what you were spending the rest of the holidays doing ? If so , I have forgotten . Perhaps I 'll see you sometime if people are meeting up somewhere in September . Anyway , enjoy the rest of the summer and remember to devote yourself daily to your duvet . Time spent in this way will not be regretted . Very best wishes , &NAME 
SUBJECT: Re : &NAME , Thanks for the email , glad all 's well . I just got back from a party / get together that &NAME was having in &NAME . I went with &NAME and it was pretty cool and we managed to watch a drama group in &NAME which was even worse than &NAME , but I do n't think I 'm allowed to say things like that . Enjoyed it though . Am now off to &NAME for a different party and am kicking myself because a honey invited me out last night and I could n't go . Anyway Just ordered a laptop as well which could basically eat most other types of laptops and I get it next week and then I can start my dissertation which I 've dedicated the next month to . If / when you come down to &NAME ( and if the others are n't trying to avoid me ) then let me know and we can all meet up . I assume it 'll be on a weekend in a couple of weeks ? &NAME duvet and all , &NAME Hi &NAME ! It was good to talk to you a few days ago .

SUBJECT: Parachuting &NAME all and welcome to a chance of a lifetime ( and no I 'm not advertising porn or debt consolidation like the other &NUM emails in your inbox ) . I turn &NUM on October 25th and I have a question for you all . Who would like to join me in parachuting around that date ? If you 've always thought about parachuting but never really imagined it happening , let me tell you something , it 's now or never . When else would you do it anyway ? The bargain : &NUM of course would not pay for you BUT &NAME ( &NAME University &NAME Club ) offers the best deal , one that you would n't find outside University . There are &NUM options : &NUM ) &NAME : &NUM minutes tuition , you are then strapped to an instructor , freefall &NUM seconds from &NUM , &NUM feet , followed by &NUM minutes descent ( unless the parachute breaks and then it might be quicker ) &NUM ) &NAME &NAME : &NUM hours training ( &NUM or &NUM evenings ) , then solo jump from &NUM , &NUM feet , parachute opens as you jump away from the plane Basically , if it 's a one off , tandem 's the way to go : &pound; &NUM with no cheap 2nd jumps . If you want to take it further , &NAME is the way to go : &pound; &NUM with any further jumps in the future only &pound; &NUM ! ! ! ! working towards solo freefalling after &NUM jumps . I 'm keen to do either but want to know which you 'd prefer . My big question to YOU ! is will you rise to the challenge ? I do n't want to jump alone and this is an excuse to &NAME and fulfil a destiny ( goran ivanisevic ) , and I invite you to join me . I fear costs will be a barrier , but let me say this : It wo n't be getting any cheaper We have &NUM weeks , and we ALL can cut corners and save enough if we really wanted to do it . Your choice . Let me know Yes or No and then we can go along to the Freefall Club in &NAME week to sign up . Hope you 're all well . &NAME PS Oh , &NUM thing , do any of you guys feel a barrier to getting in touch with people over the holidays , kind of like either they should be too busy , or you should , or you kind of forget how good friends they are ? Strange really , &NAME &NAME A lot of you are n't &NAME , but you are still more than welcome , only of course you would have to come up to &NAME to do the parachuting ( and would be welcome to sleep on my / a friend 's floor ) . I 'll also make sure it costs you no more to parachute than it does us through &NAME , bye ! ! Ring me for enquires ! : &NUM &NUM Anyone I know not on the email list is also welcome , invite them .

I have been home since last Sunday afternoon and it is wonderful . I 'd like to thank you all for your prayers and support over the past few weeks . Hospital was not fun ; but it could have been much worse and it was definitely bearable . I am now entering a period of &NUM weeks convalescence ( is n't my life well-planned ? ) before hopefully returning to &NAME . I am still in some pain and am feeling rather weak , but every morning I feel a little stronger . It is kind of like in the " &NAME " books on the star 's island ( well , I 'm hoping at least some of you will recall ) - very cool and most unusual . I was sorry not to have been able to see a lot of you at &NAME 's a few days ago but have been reliably informed by &NAME that it was an occasion enjoyed by all concerned . Yesterday we celebrated Christmas in my house - a little late , but never mind . I 'm going to get my last lot of stitches out in a few hours time - excellent . It is still quite snowy here and looks lovely .

Well , my placement is good too . I 'm doing research on coatings for paint - which is much more interesting than it sounds honestly ! I say 'doing " , but I have n't really started yet due to &NUM thing and another . Most of my time so far has been spent reading patents and being inducted .

We were supposed to start doing some experiments today but then it was pointed out we did n't have safety footwear , so that required a little trip out to buy some maybe tomorrow will see some work Wonderfully , I do n't have to get up at 6am every day any more ! I 've found someone who works there and lives in &NAME , so he gives me a lift there and back . My family has been staying with me last week . They were having a holiday in and around &NAME . Last Sunday &NAME and his family came to visit for the evening . We all went out for a meal to &NAME &NAME , and &NAME and I also went to visit &NAME &NAME . &NAME wanted to try and look around &NAME &CHAR , but it was locked .

SUBJECT: Re : Chicken &NAME Thanks for the recipe ; I will have to invite you back up in order to try it ! &NAME 
SUBJECT: hello ! Dear All , sorry for the lack of communication for the past &NUM weeks I was n't able to use my e-mail when I was in &NAME . It 's been quite an eventful month , so excuse the lack of postcards ( that were actually bought but were never actually written ! ) At the end of July I set off for &NAME with &NAME and my family . On our second day at the house , &NAME decided to do acrobatics in the shower and spend the day on the casualty ward . He twisted a muscle and injured his neck and shoulder blade . It was all quite scary and he spent the following &NUM days wearing a collar and having to be laid up all day . As you can imagine , it was n't fun for him and it made things difficult for me too as I could n't do much to help and I could n't go out at all . And. .well all of you know &NAME &NAME . He 's not really the kind for doing nothing all day so the patient was anything but . However , after many physio sessions , a bit of rest and quite a lot of time , he 's doing much better now . We did manage to have a bit of a holiday all the same . &NAME and &NAME came to stay with us for a few days and we went out and did fun things . We went to a lake &NUM day and hired a &NUM person bike-buggy thing . It was a good laugh , especially when a van came hurtling towards us on a &NAME road and &NAME and &NAME peddled like mad to get out of the way and ended up getting stuck in some tall grass . Could 've been worse .. they were n't far from ending up quite wet ! Then the &NUM of us all went to &NAME together where we met up with &NAME 's brother , &NAME , ( who , incidently is coming to &NAME 's this year ) . We went off to do our own thing most of the time but we met up with them to go on a boat along the river , and on the Friday evening we went up the &NAME &NAME to see the sunset -beautiful ! &NAME and I came home with my dad last week and my mum and brother stayed out in &NAME until this weekend . Since getting home I have had a mountain of paperwork to deal with for my year abroad . The spanish people I 've been dealing with are quite incompetent . They are incapable of signing a document and returning it , they have to re-write it and include many errors on basic but rather important details . &NAME ! These foreigners ! ! ! I am currently in &NAME , sat in a &NAME &NAME computer room . &NAME is at school for the next week , which is rather amusing . He 's doing work-shadowing kind of thing at the local &CHAR of &CHAR primary school to see whether or not he likes the teaching lark . Last night he did n't want to go and his mum told me this morning that it was like when he was &NUM and she had to practically force him out of the door ! Anyway , I came into my department to sort a few things out and get tutors to sign things etc. Of course the &NUM &NUM wanted to see are n't there but nevermind . Its really weird being in &NAME without constantly bumping into people you know . However , it is very calming being here . That may sound weird but I have n't had an easy holiday really , what with &NAME being injured and me not having a brilliant relationship with my mum . As I walked across &NAME bridge and saw &NAME and the cathedral with the sun shining on them , I just felt really at peace . I walked through town and across &NAME bridge thinking how relaxed I was , and how pleased I was to be in &NAME . I 'm really going to miss it , but I 'm so glad I 'm coming back ! Well , I leave for &NAME exactly &NUM weeks today ( 26th ) . &NAME is flying out with me for a week , whilst I get settled . Hopefully I 'll have some accomodation sorted by then , but if not we 'll have to stay at a hostel or something when we first arrive . I 'm sorry that I ca n't make the weekend to see you all . I really would really love to see you but I think I might find it hard to say goodbye ! I 've got loads to do and to sort out and I do n't want to be in a rush in the last week . I 'm getting a bit nervous now about the whole year abroad . I know it 'll be great but I 'm a little apprehensive at the moment . But anyway , I 'll not think of that at the moment . I hope that you are all well and are having relaxing holidays . I will be in touch before I go , and hopefully I might have an address to give you by then . Take care , and keep in touch . lots of love , &NAME xxx Get your FREE download of &NAME Explorer at &WEBSITE 
SUBJECT: Re : &NAME &NAME thoughts . ... Hello ! Thanks for your e-mail . Why are you in &NAME anyway ? I know nothing about the bridge in &NAME &NUM . I know nothing about the doors in &NAME . Tutors are always there ( at least chemistry &NUM are ) . " And lastly ... did n't there used to be a big cathedral thing ? " - Is this a confession ? What did you do to it ?

SUBJECT: &NAME &NAME thoughts . ... Hi all ! just a few random &NAME thoughts to share . ... has there always been the &NAME logo / shieldy thing on the window panes along the bridge in &NAME &NUM ? Have the doors downstairs in &NAME always been dark red ? Are tutors ever there when you want to see them ? hmmm . little things to report ... There is much scaffolding around &NAME &NAME ... but very little roof ! Bring umbrellas . The computers in the upstairs computer rooms appear to have been replaced with cardboard boxes . I wonder what 's inside them ? ? ! ! ! And lastly ... did n't there used to be a big cathedral thing ? &NAME I 'm mad . I 'm going but just a few personals ... &NAME : I have n't a clue where you are or when you 're going , so hope you 're ok and keep me posted of addresses and dates etc. Thanks for the postcard by the way ! &NAME : how goes it ? thanks for sending the cheque . &NAME : Thanks for the parcel . have n't opened it yet ... am being very good ! &NAME : It was so great to see you the other night . Thanks again for the meal . I 'll have to tell you sometime about the match report I got from &NAME and &NAME . Honestly they were like a pair of &NUM year olds ! &NAME : &NAME my last e-mail answered your question , i.e. I 'm going on the 26th . &NAME : Thanks . You 're a star . will be in touch . &NAME : my favourite nana , hope all the travel prep is going well . &NAME : hope you 're having a good holiday . do n't really know where you 've been , what you 've been doing but I hope that all 's well . &NAME : &NAME ! how 's things ? &NAME : Huh ! I 'm not talking to you ! ! ! get out ! ! &NAME : &NAME ! &NAME est 's? do n't let the spanish slip ... I expect e-mails written in spanish this year ! well that 's about all . I must go off to the bank to collect my spanish potatoes , &NAME .. pesetas . I ordered &pound; &NUM the other day and the woman told me I would have to pay commission if I brought any back . I answered that much as it would be great , I did n't think that &pound; &NUM would last me &NUM months , let alone leave me with any change ! anyway , I promise to stop rambling rubbish now . take care . lots of love , &NAME xxx Get your FREE download of &NAME Explorer at &WEBSITE

Anyway , we 're staying with his family at the moment who live &NUM miles out of &NAME . I had to come into town to see tutors and get contracts signed and stuff . Loads of paperwork for my year abroad . very annoying . The computer screens are indeed lilac and they 're all updated with icons on the screen and that ! very exciting . I ca n't believe you called term time a relaxing break . You must be working really hard . Do n't run yourself into the ground though , you 'll need all your energy for thinking up tricks to play on unsuspecting people on your corridor ! As for the cathedral ... it 's disappeared !

SUBJECT: hello ! Hello ! I decided that as it has been at least &NUM weeks since I sent the last e-mail , I ought to get off my backside and get sending some news ! But where to start ? Firstly , thanks for all the letters , e-mails , text messages you&acute;ve sent -they really help a lot . My first few weeks here were very hard . I missed &NAME , I felt lonely and work was fairly monotonous and frustrating . However , things have picked up lots and I&acute;m feeling a lot happier and settled . Of course I still miss &NAME and all of you , but I&acute;m coping with it much better . I&acute;ve made quite a few new friends and I&acute;ve got involved in various activities . On my first Sunday here I went to the Anglican church . It has a very small congregation but they are all very nice . They don&acute;t have a priest there at the moment so the &NAME , &NAME &NAME , organises it all and leads the service . He and his wife are very nice . They took me out with them for the day to the country and they&acute;ve put me in contact with several people here . They told me that I could ring them whenever for whatever and to treat them at adoptive parents ! It 's so great to know that I have someone there if I needed them . Once a week I&acute;m meeting up with a guy called &NAME who 's about 30ish I think . We go to a caf&eacute; and just talk about everything and anything -my aim obviously being speaking as much spanish as possible . He 's doing nightclasses in English so sometimes he asks me questions about how to pronounce things etc. I&acute;ve also started giving private english lessons to a &NUM yr old girl which gives me a little bit more cash and I get to speak spanish with the family before and after the class . Basically what I&acute;m trying to do is get involved with as many things as possible . I&acute;ve discovered that the key to me not feeling lonely , is being out of the flat as much as possible during the day and having lots of things to do and think about . I&acute;m getting on really well with the other girl who 's on a placement with me , &NAME . She 's from &NAME &NAME &NAME and we have quite a lot in common . Last night we went to the cinema together to see &quot;Moulin Rouge&quot;. I couldn&acute;t stop singing all the way back to the flat-you know what I&acute;m like with musicals ! It 's good to have a friend here to talk to in my own language and we share things when we&acute;re feeling down our missing our other halves ! My parents are coming out on Wednesday until next Sunday which I&acute;m really looking forward to . They&acute;ve hired a car so that we can go and visit stuff that I can&acute;t really get to on my own . I can&acute;t wait ! &NAME , well I&acute;m going to have to go because I desperately need to do some food shopping . It 's not a task I enjoy because I then have to carry it all up &NUM flights of stairs to my flat ! Still , I guess its no worse than &NAME ! The last thing I wanted to say was thanks for all that you did for &NAME on his birthday . I really appreciated that as you can imagine , I found it hard being so far away . It was fantastic when I was on the phone to him and a group of you came and sang happy birthday at his door . It made me really teary but I loved sharing that with you all . Anyway , I hope that you are all well and coping with your work . And for the other year-abroadites , I hope that you have all settled in too and are finding things a bit easier now . lots of love , &NAME xx &NAME 4th year &NAME students : what 's happening with the &NAME essays ? why the extension ? send me stuff before Mon if poss , because with my parents coming on Wed , I won&acute;t have time to look at it after .

SUBJECT: hello again ! Hello there ! Well , only &NUM week left hey ? Although I still have &NUM and a half weeks left to go , I 'm very excited as I get to see &NAME in &NUM days ! ! &NAME ! I ca n't believe its practically the end of term though , and I 'm sure you must all be thinking the same . The last few weeks have flown for me as I 've been quite busy . Most of you will know already , but I 've started helping out at another company in the afternoons . It 's a company called " &NAME International " and it 's a lot more interesting for me as they organise trips , courses and work abroad . As well as having to speak spanish I 've been using my french a bit and I 've also had to dredge out some German -urgh ! ( sorry &NAME , just be proud that I can still string a sentence together ! ) . Anyway , life has been good . I go to church , a youth discussion group , give some english classes , go to the cinema . I 've got my own routine and I 'm enjoying it . Work has been very strained lately as the atmosphere and relationships in the office between workers are n't too good . And last week I was left on my own for &NUM days which I was n't impressed at . At least I had plenty to do , but I had to cope with some situations that I should n't have had to deal with and the phone just would n't stop ringing ! ! It 's so frustrating when there 's more than &NUM line but there 's only &NUM of you ! Still , I 'm sure that my spanish benefitted a lot from it . I 'm starting to feel ready to come home , but unfortunately I do n't fly back until Friday 21st . Oh for uni holidays ! Anyway , just a few things I wanted to say really before you all disperse for the holidays . Firstly , thank you so much for all the support ; letters , e-mails , text messages , &NAME . I miss you all lots and although I 'm feeling settled here , it 's great to have news from &NAME ( or &NAME for those who are also abroad ) . Secondly , I really hope that term has gone well and that you are all coping with the amount of work you no doubt have , especially dissertations and those who has the silly year abroad essays ! &NAME : &NAME est-tu toujours vivant ? &NAME &CHAR &NAME would definitely be cool . &NUM weekend in January maybe ? &NAME thanks for the letter , though I presume the decorations on the envelope were an &NAME &NAME copyright design ! ? You are officially mad but fab ! Hope you trusted &NAME with your computer after the last time ? ? ! ! &NAME just want to say' thanks for everything ! &NAME my nana , qu tal la vida ? Letter should be reaching you anyday soon . &NAME busy is definitely good but take care all the same . &NAME how are you ? Hope your neighbour across the corridor does n't play his Bon Jovi too loud ! &NAME letter on its way lovely . &NAME hope the nasty thing that starts with 'D' gets started soon ! It 's a shame you ca n't write about &NAME &NAME films . &NAME how goes it footy captain ? Are you demanding tommyketchup with everything to help you swallow college food ? &NAME congrats on the success of Godspell . Heard it was brill and I hope to see the video at some point . &NAME lovely to talk to you . You are a star ! &NAME have n't heard from you in a while , is it still going ok ? Ex-marshall &CHAR lads &NAME hope you 've had a good term . &NAME any more socks-in-jelly type incidents ? &NAME is your 4th year is going ok ? &NAME &NAME think that 's it . Lastly , have a really good , restful ( if poss ) holiday and do keep in touch . I 'd really like to see you all , but as I 'm only back for &NUM weeks that obviously is n't realistic so I hope at least to speak to you all .

My christmas holiday has been quite uneventful in comparison to yours , just the usual get a bit bored and inactive during the first week or so , then get my act together and find a job in &NAME that fortunately paid quite a lot , especially considering all I was doing was filing away folders into boxes , then data entry , and then making lids for boxes , putting on lids onto boxes , and then puting masking tape round the boxes ready for being transported somewhere else ! Apart from work , Christmas and boxing days were nice family occasions as ever , and then for the weekend before new years &NAME ( or I suppose speaking to a scot , correctly speaking that 's &NAME is n't it ? ! ) I went to &NAME &NAME 's 21st bday party which was fun , followed by a posher 21st party that I went to in &NAME for a &NAME girl that I know , &NAME &NAME . ANd so by the time new years eve finally came around I was absolutely shattered and fell asleep on the sofa &NUM mins after midnight ! As for academic work , I 've been my usual self and done very little indeed . As I go back to &NAME on Saturday that leaves me &NUM last day to write an old testament essay , so I think I 'm going to have problems there but nevermind . Anyway , I 'm afraid I 'd better go now as my brother and his girlfriend are cooking a meal for the rest of the family which is quite an unheard of event and &NAME it 's going to be ready in &NUM / &NUM minutes ... hope you continue to make a good improvement and hopefully we 'll see you back in &NAME soon , Take care and &NAME &NAME , &NAME ps we 'll pray for you in CU !

SUBJECT: new e-mail address Dear Everyone Sorry to fill your inboxes but since I am leaving &NAME after this summer and ca n't use this e-mail address I have made a new one , so here it is : &EMAIL jinsun&SMILEY 
SUBJECT: Re : Another of those flipping change of address emails ... as I 'm leaving &NAME my email is changing ; it is now : &EMAIL &NAME 
SUBJECT: sun , sea and ... work ! Hello there ! I hope this e-mail works I shall be very frustrated if it does n't. I 've been trying to send emails for nearly &NUM weeks and it 's not been working ( sorry to those who got blank messages ! ) . My computer is very slow and does n't appear to like Hotmail so it keeps shutting down when I press send . Not impressed . Anyway , life is pretty good at the moment in &NAME . The weather is beautiful , unbelievable for January shame I have to go to work really ! But I do enjoy my new work so much more . I mean , obviously it could n't have possibly been any worse than the Chamber of Commerce but I actually like the majority of stuff that I 'm doing which makes a nice change . The Christmas holidays seems years ago now . I had a nice time at home though I was quite tired when I got back to &NAME as I spent a lot of the &NUM weeks travelling around driving back home from &NAME in the snow is much fun I assure you ! It was really nice to see people at &NAME . Sorry for those I did n't get to see . I 've had a nice weekend which I needed after my busy week . Or at least it was nice until I found out last night that I do n't have a room in college next year . I 've calmed down a bit now but the language I was using on the phone last night to &NAME was n't very ladylike . But c' est la vie I guess ! Still , being on the reserve list hopefully it may yet be ok . I might have to be back in a &NAME Wing shoebox but at least it 'll be my room ! Fingers crossed . But anyway , on Saturday I went out for the day with &NAME . It was a gorgeous day and we took a little train that goes along the coast ( and is very cheap ) with the intention of going to some nice quiet place . Unfortunately the trains only go once an hour and the one we arrived for only went as far as &NAME . And what can I say about Benidorm ? Well , not a lot really . ( apologies to anyone who goes there on holiday ) . A lot of concrete and people speaking english ! The front is nice enough and there 's a promenade along the beach . We ended up just walking along there and then sitting on the beach in the sun eating chocolate ice-creams yum ! What else ? Well I 've just been very busy with various things . The days seem to fly as I 'm now working full time . I have the break in the middle of the day and then go back to work &NUM generally . By the time I get back to my flat , I tend to eat , watch TV and then go to bed . I still go to the cinema pretty regularly . I saw &NAME 's &NUM last week which was really good . So generally things are going well . I feel much happier and settled this term and I think I 'm making the most of things more . I had a bizarre experience at the airport when I flew back because I met a girl called &NAME who I 'd been at 6th form with , and she 'd been on my flight . We were in A-level spanish classes together and she 's out in &NAME for her year abroad on a work placement . Small world ! We met up and had a good catch up ( &NUM hadnt seen her since our A-level spanish exam so you can imagine how long we talked for ) . Anyway , I wo n't keep you all from your essays and dissertations an longer ( apart from the other &NAME slackers ) . Just a few personals : &NAME are you still going to &NAME with everything that 's going on ? &NAME thanks for your letter . Sorry about &NAME . Would 've been quite hard for me too so that 's ok ! Bonnes vacances ! &NAME How 's the job hunting ? Wo n't be making it to &NAME , but if you 're ever around &NAME ... &NAME mystery of lost letter solved . Wrong address . I 'm in &NAME . You sent it to the house in &NAME ! Will be in posession of it soon . &NAME hope you 're feeling better now and that the mission is going well . &NAME still hyper ! ? ! Thanks for everything . &NAME , I am going to go now . I hope that you are all well . I do think about you all lots , and I hope that you 're coping with your work . I do n't get to check my e-mails too often but I will try to be in touch more personally soon . Take care . Lots of love , &NAME xx Get your FREE download of &NAME Explorer at &WEBSITE .

I arrived back from &NAME camp yesterday after a rather intense week of abseiling , go-karting , mountain biking , sport , activities , bible study , prayer , music and meetings . Oh , and yes , there were &NUM &NUM and &NUM year olds as well . I enjoyed myself and was immensely relieved not to be sharing a dorm with children this time . Consequently I enjoyed a much more respectable &NUM or &NUM hours sleep each night . More importantly , one of the children made a commitment to &NAME , which was wonderful . Last Tuesday evening we all played &NAME outside in the grounds of the country house we stayed in. &NUM had to dress up as a &NAME , and this I did with some relish . Yesterday evening I went to a concert in &NAME . The &NAME &NAME Philharmonic Orchestra was playing . This afternoon I 've been with my family to &NAME - a nearby country house . It is very warm today and I like it . We had quite a good week , weather wise , for the camp . Tomorrow morning I begin my new job for &NUM weeks . I will be working from &NUM o' clock until &NUM in the lab , and I am quite looking forward to it although I hope it will not be too boring . I hope you enjoy the remainder of your time in &NAME .

( just imagine it 's a postcard , with a picture of an elephant on , which we meant to send you but did n't ... ! ! ) We did a whole range of things while we were there - playing footie with kids in childrens homes , singing songs and playing with them , do ( or more attempting to do ! ! ) building on &NUM different sites , a week 's mission outreach in the middle of nowhere ( a 19hr truck ride away , which was only supposed to take &NAME , well so they said ! ! ) and &NAME and I both preached ( can you imagine that ? ! ) , a week by the coast building a mud church and enjoying the beach and a week on a footie camp , with some amazing footie players , some of them played for the kenyan women 's team ( our skills were somewhat lacking ! ! ) . ... THE &NAME ! ! ! Is good to be back home , if a little bizarre with the big culture difference ! Am looking for a job at the &NAME , am trying to find translating work , although I do n't know how likely that 'll be . If not , I 'll just do some temping work . Am going down to &NAME &NAME to meet up with &NAME and go on a camp with her til tuesday . Do n't know much about it yet , guess I 'll find out when I get there ! ! For now though , hope you 're well and trying to enjoy the job ( if not actually succeeding to ! ) -hey think of all that money you 've earnt , when all I 've done this summer is spent it ! ! &NAME akubariki ( god bless ) love from &NAME PS . for me , this is a LONG email , so I hope you feel priveledged ! !

SUBJECT: Hello ! Hi &NAME ! " &NAME . For me , this is a LONG email , so I hope you feel privileged ! ! ( mainly &NAME I take a long time typing ! ! ) " - Thank you , I feel very privileged ! Well , it sounds as if you had a really good time in &NAME . &NAME , you preached ! Are you getting used to the culture difference ? Have you had any success in finding a job yet ? I hope you have ( probably " had " by the time you read this ) a good time at camp with &NAME . " I hope your job 's going well and is not too boring ! Do you still want to carry on chemistry after working in a lab for &NUM weeks ? ! " - My job currently entails staring out of the window , but they keep telling me It 'll soon get busier I hope so ! Of course I still want to do chemistry , I think ! 'Mungo akubariki " - What language is that ? Well , I hope you enjoy the remainder of your summer ! I 'm going on holiday ( sort of ) on Thursday for a few days to &NAME &NAME . It 's my cousin 's wedding and we are going over for that . &NUM and a half days off work - wonderful ! I do n't think I shall be able to send you a postcard with an elephant on it , but perhaps a normal one ! When do you go away to wherever you are going ( I 've forgotten where ) ?

SUBJECT: my so-called life ! ! &NAME a tutti ! I hope you 're all well and coping with the chaos of college life ( for those at &NAME , which is most of you ... ! ) As you may have realised , have been trying to email everyone separately , but after a few weeks of attempting to compete with my inbox , have decided to give in and email you altogether . It 's not very personal I know , but at least it should be something to brighten up the cold , rainy days in &NAME ( or &NAME , &NAME , &NAME , &NAME or &NAME . ... anywhere else ? ! ) First of all , thank you so much to everyone who sent me cards and pressies last week . ( and if you did n't, do n't worry , there 's always christmas ... ! ! ) no seriously though ( as &NAME would say ! ) , I was touched by how many people remembered . letters are on their way ... even though they seem to take forever to get there ! ( my Dad 's card arrived &NUM weeks after his b-day ... ) Had a really good time . My parents and sister came for the weekend and I showed them all the sites of &NAME ( there are n't that many , luckily ! ) . in the evening we had drinks at our house , then went on to a restaurant . a few of the others had friends visiting , so we were quite a big all-english group , which is a novelty , &NAME there 's only &NUM english people here . On saturday went with my family to a place called &NAME . my dad was driving the hired car ( or should I say tin can ... ) and was amazingly patient with the italian drivers ( who only honked at us a few times ) , and my Mum and sister arguing over which was the best way to go ( I just keep out of it ... ) . it was a beautiful little town with a marble square and lots of cobbled streets . quite like &NAME , only smaller . They left on sunday and I went to watch &NAME play against &NAME ( if I have n't told you , &NAME 's in the third division , at the bottom of the league , so basically have nothing to lose ) and we won &NUM ! it 's always a great atmosphere there and also it 's something to do on a sunday afternoon , when everything else is closed . This week " &CHAR been back to normal , going to lectures and language classes , playing some tennis , going for some runs ( short &NUM , you understand ) and seeing friends . got an italian cook book for my birthday , so we 've been trying out a few local recipes too . although when it comes to cakes ( which it happens quite often , not sure why . ... ) we 've mainly stuck to english recipes , just to make us feel at home ! &NAME and &NAME ( one of my house mates ) gave me italian monopoly as well . played it the other night , although it got quite competitive ( slightly reminiscent of playing Taboo with &NAME ... ! ! ) Before I go , want to say to : &NAME - hello pob ! ! loved the pea card- was cool . made me laugh-of course ! hope you noticed I 'm still trying to do the staying in contact thing ... ! &NAME - I did meet your aunt 's brother-in-law ( briefly ) . ... bizarre ! thanks for your emails , esp telling me about the reunion . glad to hear you 've got a work placement- knew someone would want you ! how 's your warm feeling ? ! &NAME - I 'm in &NAME ! ! so cool to hear from you , and that you 've got a flat ! xx &NAME - thanks for the card , sorry have n't got in contact . hope Godspell rehearsals are going well xx &NAME ( &CHAR ) and &NAME - helllooooo ! ! hope you 're both doing well . meant to be in touch sooner ... ! although have been kept up to date ( roughly ) with what you 're up to ... &NAME , &NAME and &NAME - again , sorry for not emailing . hope you 're enjoying being back in college and being very wise fourth years ! ! &NAME , &NAME and &NAME - cheers for the card !

What are the latest results ? &NAME + &NAME , &NAME , &NAME , &NAME - letters are coming !

But it 's ( mostly ) quite good fun ! I think I shall go and see &NAME &NAME . I have yet to read any of the books , amazingly enough .

SUBJECT: PARTY ! ! Salve amici ! ! I trust you 're all fine and &NAME , as well as being exteremely busy with work , plays , football , climbing ( that 's just for you , &NAME ! ) and lots of nearly-end-of- term-Christmas socialising ! ( apologies to you fellow abroad peops , who are probably not doing any of those things ... ! ) I know it 's been a couple of weeks since &CHAR last emailed , it 's been all go here , with a whirlwind of revision ( yes , it did happen , it 's not a typing error ! ) last week for my exam . I suddenly realised on monday that I did n't know anything about futurism , or anything else before or after it . and I had to speak in italian - nice one ! did n't have a clue what to expect and thought we might have to do a presentation or just have a chat . it ended up being a chat with the lecturer , who 's really nice . all I had to do was talk a bit about my favourite paintings and then tell her about &NAME . a really tough exam ! somehow &CHAR came out with &NUM / &NUM - &CHAR reckon she just made up a mark and gave it to me , &CHAR hardly knew anything ! ! So anyway after that exam stress ( ! ) , decided we had to celebrate our results , and on Monday , &NAME , &NAME and I went to &NAME . Took a long time to get there by bus , train and tram but found the hostel quickly and walked along the sea front which was lit up . Was told that the city is n't very nice but it 's still somewhere you have to go to ! I did n't think it was that bad , but there are lots of other prettier cities here , so I can understand what they mean . The next day we went to &NAME , which is more like a resort , and a place where celebraties go ( lots of yachts and posh hotels , darling ! ) I loved it there . Was really relaxing , after the caos of &NAME ! Now I 'm back here for a bit . Then I 'm going to watch &NAME play Inter , at &NAME next week . Am meeting up with &NAME &NAME and some friends to watch the second leg . ( We won &NUM last time ! ! ) And there ends the exciting update on what I 'm up to ! ! BUT the main reason I 'm emailing , is to say that the NEW YEAR 'S PARTY is still on . If you all want to come , it is ... ! ! At the moment , I do n't have a clue about any details , that can wait til nearer the time . But I would LOVE to see you all and for it to go ahead . Some of you , I have n't seen since July - how long is that ! &NAME and &NAME are probably going to &NAME 's party instead , but are hoping to make it to my house on New Year 's Day , so hopefully we could make it into a &NUM day thing , so that &NAME can see everyone as well ! Also please feel free to invite anyone , especially as I did n't have everyone 's email addresses , both in our year and other years .

SUBJECT: Hi Dear &NAME , Hello ! &SMILEY How are you ? What have you been up to for the last week or so ? How is the European Computer Driving Licence going ? Are you still planning on staying here when you come up to &NAME in a few weeks ? I 'm enjoying living in the flat ; it 's good fun so far . Well , my placement is good . I 'm doing research on coatings for paint - which is much more interesting than it sounds honestly ! I say 'doing " , but I have n't really started yet due to &NUM thing and another . Most of my time so far has been spent reading patents and being inducted . There are a few other students working there too , so that 's nice . We were supposed to start doing some experiments today but then it was pointed out we did n't have safety footwear , so that required a little trip out to buy some maybe tomorrow will see some work Wonderfully , I do n't have to get up at 6am every day any more ! I 've found someone who works there and lives in &NAME , so he gives me a lift there and back . My family has been staying with me last week . They were having a holiday in and around &NAME . Last Sunday &NAME and his family came to visit for the evening . We all went out for a meal to &NAME &NAME , and &NAME and I also went to visit &NAME &NAME . &NAME wanted to try and look around &NAME &CHAR , but it was locked . However , &NAME I was open so we wandered in there and looked around a little - most bizarre ! We also had a little look in &NAME &NAME &NAME says he 's hoping to have the same holiday again next year for all those who can make it - hooray ! &NAME to hear from you soon . &NAME 
SUBJECT: Re : Hi Hi &NAME ! cant believe how quickly the weeks have flown by . so glad you 're enjoying your placement , and researching for the next &NAME super paint ! what aspects are you researching ? the only thing I know is not to lean against it ! I 've been really enjoying the work I 'm doing , although there always seems to be more to do , so its a bit frantic . the computer course is great , its actually quite fun and I even have a woman saying " Well Done " every time I do something right ! I 'm impressed I remembered its full name ! not sure when I can do the exam , but I want to take it after doing all the work . have finished the first part ( &NUM hrs - officially ! ! ) and am on to the next one . I 've also sent out lots of envelopes to collect mobiles too , so hopefully that means I will have raised a fair bit of money for Christian Aid in the end . and I 've been phoning up solicitors to try and persuade them to join a scheme in which they make wills for people , who then donate money . hmm . ... some ( but few ) have wanted to sign up . basically &CHAR 're dependent on their good will ! ! oh , and have played quite a few games of scrabble . my dad bought me the official dictionary , &NAME I 'm always asking him whether each word is a word or not ! so now we 'll be able to play scrabble with the official dictionary next term ! do n't know if &NAME 's been in contact . probably not ! so thought I better warn &CHAR that we 'll be arriving at about 9pm on friday night , if its still alright for us to stay . she said she 'd bring a couple of camp beds ( small compact &NUM ! ) on the train . I cant wait for our visit ! ! it 'll be so nice to have a break ! look forward to seeing you then , and sorry for the fairly late notice ... ! &NAME &NAME &NAME is the easiest way to share and print your photos : Click Here

My job is going well too although no explosions to date &SMILEY - actually , probably : &CHAR ) ! Glad you had a good time seeing &NAME . I spoke to her a couple of days ago and she said she was hoping to come up to &NAME to visit us the last weekend in October , so that should be nice . I 'm having a half day today ! I was n't intending to , because generally I ca n't, but the guy who takes me to and from work is having one so that suits me ! It will give me a chance to get some things done and prepare for visiting &NAME anyway . Hope you had a good time with &NAME and Ed. &NAME and &NAME came to visit me on Wednesday evening and it was good to see them again and say hello . Oh well , must find something else to do here - my colleague is having a French lesson , so I 'm at a bit of a loose end at the moment . Hope you have a good week ! Very best wishes , &NAME

SUBJECT: Greetings Hi &NAME ! Are you enjoying &NAME ? What have you been doing ? How hot is it ? &NAME is still alive . I was in &NAME yesterday , and went to the zoo there last week at &NAME camp . I arrived back from &NAME camp yesterday . &NUM intense week of abseiling , go-karting , mountain biking , sport , activities , bible study , prayer , music and meetings . Oh , and yes , there were &NUM &NUM and &NUM year olds as well . Children say the most curious things . I think my &NUM favourites from this week were " are we allowed to get the dinner plates dirty when we eat ? " and 'do you have to sign a form to become a Christian ? " Joking aside though , I enjoyed myself and was immensely relieved not to be sharing a dorm with children this time . Consequently I enjoyed a much more respectable &NUM or &NUM hours sleep each night . More importantly , one of the children made a commitment to &NAME , which was wonderful . Last Tuesday evening we all played &NAME outside in the grounds of the country house we stayed in. &NUM had to dress up as a &NAME , and this I did with some relish . I also saw &NAME &NAME , who seemed well . She was a leader at the camp too . Yesterday evening I went to a concert in &NAME . The &NAME &NAME Philharmonic Orchestra was playing . This afternoon I 've been with my family to &NAME - a nearby country house . It is very warm today and I like it . We had quite a good week , weather wise , for the camp . Tomorrow morning I begin my new job for &NUM weeks . I will be working from &NUM o' clock until &NUM in the lab , and I am quite looking forward to it although I hope it will not be too boring . Very best wishes , &NAME

Well , we watched &NAME &NAME ( &NAME , &NAME and &CHAR ) on Saturday evening , and the first words to appear on the screen were " &NAME " - the setting ! I ca n't get away from it ... Thank you very much for your card . You should have been an animation assistant in " Chicken Run " . Well , what have you been doing since you got back to &NAME ? Has your life been caught up once more into its hectic pace ? I had a really lovely weekend with &NAME and &NAME . I was very very surprised to see them and did n't suspect a thing ( even after I received an email adding me to the CU mailing list for the second time ) . We went a walk along the coast , played biblical trivial pursuits , watched &NAME &NAME , went to church , ate food , did simultaneous equations ( which &NAME really enjoys - surprisingly ) , and talked . I intend to be in &NAME for a short visit on Monday as I have a lab that I want to go to . It only lasts for &NUM hour in the morning so hopefully I 'll see you later in the day sometime . I am reasonably busy working and did quite a lot yesterday . I 'm doing more today . Tomorrow afternoon I 'm going to &NAME to see " &NAME of the Rings " - finally ! Hopefully I wo n't experience a power cut in the middle as &NAME did last week . Enjoy the rest of today . Best wishes , &NAME

SUBJECT: noodles & sugar Hi &NAME , I 'm glad to hear your dissertation is nearly finished . Word is good at crashing on &NAME , I think . Have the open day people gone ? How nasty of them to write rude messages on your door . Quite scandalous ! Why is &NAME probably enjoying her holidays better than I am ? I am in &NAME she is in &NAME . The probabilities confuse me . Yesterday I did some work . Today I did less . Tomorrow will take care of itself . I had an email from &NAME this morning telling me how many people she was going to be seeing in the next few days very envy-inducing ! But I am content with my molecules . So did you get all your references done yesterday ? Does that mean you 're finished today ? Have you seen &NAME ? I hear he came up to visit the library for the day . What camp exactly are you going on ? I ca n't seem to find it in the brochure . Are you sure it exists ? I am enjoying deleting files from my computer as I have transferred them all to my family 's new one . It is most satisfying to see &NAME increase her performance so dramatically . It is a very nasty day here today . Yesterday was delightful it reminded me of spring . I went for a walk and began to perspire so I returned to my organometallic synthesis . I am making dinner this evening for my brother and I as my parents have gone to &NAME for the evening . It 's their 24th wedding anniversary or rather it was yesterday . Are you having noodles and sugar or something equally delightful this evening ? Hope you are well , &NAME

SUBJECT: &NAME &NAME Fresh from the antics of the &NAME household I am pleased to inform you of today 's comedy incident . This morning , what with this being Sunday , and &NAME Sunday at that , we all went to church . After church there was an emergancey meeting for the elders but as the &NUM children had n't seen some of their friends at the church for ages the mother and the grandmother went home to get the lunch ready . With them they took their &NUM cars leaving the father and the &NUM children with &NUM car . ( &CHAR little comical already I hear you cry but mum and sis and bro had to be at church at &NUM and dad and sis and me did not and granny started the day in carnoutstie ) So anyway the church meeting finsihed about &NUM hour after it started ! and the children were waiting for their father to take them home but no father sneaked passed the children and they were left stranded nearly &NUM miles from their house ! ! ! ( The story ends happily when the father realises his error and returns to collect his children who have started to walk home ) But this raises the interesting questions how exactly it is possible that the father forgot his children and how he did n't notice the &NUM of them in the church hall waiting . This ladies and gentleman happened today in the &NAME household ! ! Other than that nothing of substance is happening . Spring is coming though and the &NAME is ot on the tree outside my room which is very pleasant . &NAME &NAME &NAME &NAME thank you for the book . &NAME &NUM &NUM &NUM What days can you do this week ?

SUBJECT: Hi Dear &NAME , Hello ! &SMILEY How are you ? I presume you might be back home when you read this . So , " what was &NAME like ? " How many people will be asking you that I wonder ? I 'm enjoying living in the flat ; it 's good fun so far and so is my placement . I 'm doing research on coatings for paint - which is much more interesting than it sounds honestly ! I say 'doing " , but I have n't really started yet due to &NUM thing and another . Most of my time so far has been spent reading patents and being inducted . There are a few other students working there too , so that 's nice . We were supposed to start doing some experiments today but then it was pointed out we did n't have safety footwear , so that required a little trip out to buy some maybe tomorrow will see some work Wonderfully , I do n't have to get up at 6am every day any more ! I 've found someone who works there and lives in &NAME , so he gives me a lift there and back . Sorry I have n't emailed much - internet access has been rather difficult as college is the nearest online place for me and I only manage to check it once or twice a week ! However , I now have a computer at work so that should make things easier . My family has been staying with me last week . They were having a holiday in and around &NAME . Last Sunday &NAME and his family came to visit for the evening . We all went out for a meal to &NAME &NAME , and &NAME and I also went to visit &NAME &NAME . &NAME wanted to try and look around &NAME &CHAR , but it was locked . However , &NAME I was open so we wandered in there and looked around a little - most bizarre ! We also had a little look in &NAME &NAME &NAME to hear from you sometime . &NAME

Anyone disagreeing with &NAME will be subject to major bouts of &NAME . &NUM &NAME reseves the right to help &NAME cook any of her patent messes . &NUM . &NAME reserves the right to not eat any of &NAME 's patent messes . &NUM &NAME may only be sung once per week ( ... &NAME ) . &NUM &NAME will never dry up with damp or smelly dishcloths . &NUM &NAME does not eat weird foodstuffs . &NUM &NAME does not eat foodstuffs not native to her own country , ie , no Scottish or Canadian yucky stuff . &NUM &NAME will not be photographed over dinner ( &NAME ) , nor sung to ( &NAME ) , nor cleaned ( &NAME ) , nor faffed at ( &NAME ) . &NAME refuses to be subject to conversations on the subjects of : work &NAME &NAME quality of food quantity of food boys &NAME &NAME TV scheduling for the next few hours of that day &NAME 's mess &NAME 's fussiness &NAME &NAME ... over dinner , as these distract from the shovelling . &NUM Finally , &NAME refuses absolutely to clean up after &NAME has been cooking .

SUBJECT: to &NAME , etc : flat stuff To my erstwhile flatmates to be : My friends , I am about to embark on a journey of epic proportions , whereby I travel to the wilds of a savage country in an effort to civilise the natives , who , from what I am have gathered , are most vicious . You will have guessed by now that I am to depart for &NAME tomorrow , and that my nerves are in tatters . I wanted to send you all a &NAME ( no pun intended ) message before I went , mainly concerned with the humdrum daily life we intend to lead together as of next year . I am a humble seeker after information : &NUM How much are we putting in the account each week ? &NUM What does this cover ? Is it just food , or is it household commodities also ( eg dettol , I realise bulk buying is cheaper ) , and electricity bills ? &NUM What does anybody estimate elec . , food , and other necessary stuff to cost ? &NUM Can we have a TV please ? I would quite like one , and it would save you all from having to talk to me . Mums and the &NAME have agreed that we can have our familial " little TV " in the flat . If we have a TV , we need to investigate whether it would be cheaper to have this or to hire one . And what about a video ? Do we really need a TV licence ? Ca n't we just get away without one ? Just kidding , but we need to discuss why &NAME wo n't marry &NAME in &NAME ... sorry , I mean we need to discuss all this first . And if I turns out we do n't have a black box , I know I 'll survive . &NUM Guys ( literally ) , after your meeting at the end of term , which items necessary for our daily living do you require my fellow missionary and I to buy ? Tell me now , while I have money in the bank . Or at least , less of an overdraft . I am coming to the end of my packet of Minstrels , and therefore my imagination . I shall leave you all to pray for my safekeeping , and torture yourself with thoughts of my early death at the hands of the saveges ( if not &NAME ) . I hope you all have a very interesting week discussing this , and that you manage to make all the difficult decisions prior to my return . Blessings to you all , my best and most favoured of friends , &NAME , aka &NAME , &NAME , &NAME , &NAME , &NAME , &NAME , &NAME , The &NAME , &NAME , &NAME , blah , blah , blah ... PS How bizarre if this were you , &NAME : my mother and sister went to &NAME on Thursday , to &NAME College , to see if my sister liked it . She should , of course , have done this before accepting the place . But hey . Anyway , while they were there , Mums said she saw students asking people if they wanted to go punting . I said politely , &CHAR really ? &NAME does that . She said , does he have auburn hair ? Because I saw &NUM boy with auburn hair ? Hmmm. . . &NAME &NAME , please do n't viciously and amusingly reply to my remarks about your motherland .

SUBJECT: &NAME 's Day &NAME &NAME &NAME &NAME ! &NAME &NAME &NAME Signior ? &NAME In my chamber-window lies a book : bring it hither to me in the orchard . &NAME I am here already , sir . &NAME I know that ; but I would have thee hence , and here again . &NAME &NAME I do much wonder that &NUM man , seeing how much another man is a fool when he dedicates his behaviors to love , will , after he hath laughed at such shallow follies in others , become the argument of his own scorn by failing in love : and such a man is &NAME . I have known when there was no music with him but the drum and the &NAME ; and now had he rather hear the tabour and the pipe : I have known when he would have walked &NUM mile a-foot to see a good armour ; and now will he lie &NUM nights awake , carving the fashion of a new doublet . He was wont to speak plain and to the purpose , like an honest man and a soldier ; and now is he turned orthography ; his words are a very fantastical banquet , just so many strange dishes . May I be so converted and see with these eyes ? I cannot tell ; I think not : I will not be sworn , but love may transform me to an oyster ; but I 'll take my oath on it , till he have made an oyster of me , he shall never make me such a fool . &NUM woman is fair , yet I am well ; another is wise , yet I am well ; another virtuous , yet I am well ; but till all graces be in &NUM woman , &NUM woman shall not come in my grace . &NAME she shall be , that 's certain ; wise , or I 'll none ; virtuous , or I 'll never cheapen her ; fair , or I 'll never look on her ; mild , or come not near me ; noble , or not I for an angel ; of good discourse , an excellent musician , and her hair shall be of what colour it please &NAME . &NAME ! the prince and Monsieur Love ! I will hide me in the arbour . Withdraws &NAME &NAME &NAME , &NAME , and &NAME &NAME &NAME &NAME , shall we hear this music ? &NAME &NAME , my good lord . How still the evening is , As hush 'd on purpose to grace harmony ! &NAME &NAME See you where &NAME hath hid himself ? &NAME &CHAR , very well , my lord : the music ended , We 'll fit the kid-fox with a pennyworth . Enter BALTHASAR with Music &NAME &NAME &NAME , &NAME , we 'll hear that song again . BALTHASAR &CHAR , good my lord , tax not so bad a voice To slander music any more than once . &NAME &NAME It is the witness still of excellency To put a strange face on his own perfection . I pray thee , sing , and let me woo no more . BALTHASAR Because you talk of wooing , I will sing ; Since many a wooer doth commence his suit To her he thinks not worthy , yet he wooes , Yet will he swear he loves . &NAME &NAME Now , pray thee , come ; Or , if thou wilt hold longer argument , Do it in notes . BALTHASAR Note this before my notes ; There 's not a note of mine that 's worth the noting . &NAME &NAME Why , these are very crotchets that he speaks ; Note , notes , forsooth , and nothing . Air &NAME Now , divine air ! now is his soul ravished ! Is it not strange that sheeps " guts should &NAME souls out of men 's bodies ? Well , a horn for my money , when all 's done . The &NAME BALTHASAR &NAME no more , ladies , sigh no more , Men were deceivers ever , &NUM foot in sea and one on shore , To &NUM thing constant never : Then sigh not so , but let them go , And be you blithe and bonny , Converting all your sounds of woe Into Hey nonny , nonny . Sing no more ditties , sing no moe , Of dumps so dull and heavy ; The fraud of men was ever so , Since summer first was leafy : Then sigh not so , & &CHAR . &NAME &NAME By my troth , a good song . BALTHASAR And an ill singer , my lord . &NAME &NAME &NAME , no , no , faith ; thou singest well enough for a shift . &NAME An he had been a dog that should have howled thus , they would have hanged him : and I pray &NAME his bad voice bode no mischief . I had as lief have heard the night-raven , come what plague could have come after it . &NAME &NAME &NAME , marry , dost thou hear , &NAME ? I pray thee , get us some excellent music ; for to-morrow night we would have it at the &NAME &NAME 's chamber-window . BALTHASAR The best I can , my lord . &NAME &NAME Do so : &NAME . &NAME BALTHASAR Come hither , &NAME . What was it you told me of to-day , that your niece &NAME was in love with &NAME &NAME ? &NAME &CHAR , ay : stalk on . stalk on ; the fowl sits . I did never think that lady would have loved any man . &NAME No , nor I neither ; but most wonderful that she should so dote on &NAME &NAME , whom she hath in all outward behaviors seemed ever to abhor . &NAME Is 't possible ? Sits the wind in that corner ? &NAME By my troth , my lord , &NUM cannot tell what to think of it but that she loves him with an enraged affection : it is past the infinite of thought . &NAME &NAME &NAME be she doth but counterfeit . &NAME &NAME , like enough . &NAME &CHAR &NAME , counterfeit ! There was never counterfeit of passion came so near the life of passion as she discovers it . &NAME &NAME Why , what effects of passion shows she ? &NAME &NAME the hook well ; this fish will bite . &NAME What effects , my lord ? She will sit you , you heard my daughter tell you how . &NAME She did , indeed . &NAME &NAME How , how , pray you ? You amaze me : I would have I thought her spirit had been invincible against all assaults of affection . &NAME I would have sworn it had , my lord ; especially against &NAME . &NAME I should think this a gull , but that the white-bearded fellow speaks it : knavery cannot , sure , hide himself in such reverence . &NAME He hath ta' en the infection : hold it up . &NAME &NAME &NAME she made her affection known to &NAME ? &NAME No ; and swears she never will : that 's her torment . &NAME " Tis true , indeed ; so your daughter says : 'Shall I , " says she , " that have so oft encountered him with scorn , write to him that I love him ? " &NAME This says she now when she is beginning to write to him ; for she 'll be up &NUM times a night , and there will she sit in her smock till she have writ a sheet of paper : my daughter tells us all . &NAME Now you talk of a sheet of paper , I remember a pretty jest your daughter told us of . &NAME &CHAR , when she had writ it and was reading it over , she found &NAME and &NAME between the sheet ? &NAME That . &NAME &CHAR , she tore the letter into a thousand halfpence ; railed at herself , that she should be so immodest to write to one that she knew would flout her ; " I measure him , " says she , " by my own spirit ; for I should flout him , if he writ to me ; yea , though I love him , I should . " &NAME Then down upon her knees she falls , weeps , sobs , beats her heart , tears her hair , prays , curses ; " &CHAR sweet &NAME ! &NAME give me patience ! " &NAME She doth indeed ; my daughter says so : and the ecstasy hath so much overborne her that my daughter is sometime afeared she will do a desperate outrage to herself : it is very true . &NAME &NAME It were good that &NAME knew of it by some other , if she will not discover it . &NAME To what end ? He would make but a sport of it and torment the poor lady worse . &NAME &NAME An he should , it were an alms to hang him . She 's an excellent sweet lady ; and , out of all suspicion , she is virtuous . &NAME And she is exceeding wise . &NAME &NAME In every thing but in loving &NAME . &NAME &CHAR , my lord , &NAME and blood combating in so tender a body , we have &NUM proofs to one that blood hath the victory . I am sorry for her , as I have just cause , being her uncle and her guardian . &NAME &NAME I would she had bestowed this dotage on me : I would have daffed all other respects and made her half myself . I pray you , tell &NAME of it , and hear what &CHAR " will say . &NAME Were it good , think you ? &NAME &NAME thinks surely she will die ; for she says she will die , if he love her not , and she will die , ere she make her love known , and she will die , if he woo her , rather than she will bate &NUM breath of her accustomed crossness . &NAME &NAME She doth well : if she should make tender of her love , " tis very possible he 'll scorn it ; for the man , as you know all , hath a contemptible spirit . &NAME He is a very proper man . &NAME &NAME He hath indeed a good outward happiness . &NAME Before &NAME ! and , in my mind , very wise . &NAME &NAME He doth indeed show some sparks that are like wit . &NAME And I take him to be valiant . &NAME &NAME As &NAME , I assure you : and in the managing of quarrels you may say he is wise ; for either he avoids them with great discretion , or undertakes them with a most Christian-like fear . &NAME If he do fear &NAME , &CHAR " must necessarily keep peace : if he break the peace , he ought to enter into a quarrel with fear and trembling . &NAME &NAME And so will he do ; for the man doth fear &NAME , howsoever it seems not in him by some large jests he will make . Well I am sorry for your niece . Shall we go seek &NAME , and tell him of her love ? &NAME Never tell him , my lord : let her wear it out with good counsel . &NAME &NAME , that 's impossible : she may wear her heart out first . &NAME &NAME Well , we will hear further of it by your daughter : let it cool the while . I love &NAME well ; and I could wish he would modestly examine himself , to see how much he is unworthy so good a lady . &NAME My lord , will you walk ? dinner is ready . &NAME If he do not dote on her upon this , I will never trust my expectation . &NAME &NAME Let there be the same net spread for her ; and that must your daughter and her gentlewomen carry . The sport will be , when they hold one an opinion of another 's dotage , and no such matter : that 's the scene that I would see , which will be merely a dumb-show . Let us send her to call him in to dinner . &NAME &NAME &NAME , &NAME , and &NAME &NAME [ Coming forward ] This can be no trick : the conference was sadly borne . They have the truth of this from &NAME . They seem to pity the lady : it seems her affections have their full &NAME &NAME . Love me ! why , it must be requited . I hear how I am censured : they say I will bear myself proudly , if I perceive the love come from her ; they say too that she will rather die than give any sign of affection . I did never think to marry : I must not seem proud : happy are they that hear their detractions and can put them to mending . They say the lady is fair ; " tis a truth , I can bear them witness ; and virtuous ; " tis so , &NUM cannot reprove it ; and wise , but for loving me ; by my troth , it is no addition to her wit , nor no great argument of her folly , for I will be horribly in love with her . I may chance have some odd quirks and remnants of wit broken on me , because I have railed so long against marriage : but doth not the appetite alter ? a man loves the meat in his youth that he cannot endure in his age . Shall quips and sentences and these paper bullets of the brain awe a man from the career of his humour ? No , the world must be peopled . When I said I would die a bachelor , I did not think I should live till I were married . Here comes &NAME . By this day ! she 's a fair lady : I do spy some marks of love in her . &NAME &NAME &NAME Against my will I am sent to bid you come in to dinner . &NAME &NAME &NAME , I thank you for your pains . &NAME I took no more pains for those thanks than you take pains to thank me : if it had been painful , I would not have come . &NAME You take pleasure then in the message ? &NAME &NAME , just so much as you may take upon a knife 's point and choke a daw withal . You have no stomach , signior : fare you well . &NAME &NAME &NAME ! " Against my will I am sent to bid you come in to dinner ; " there 's a double meaning in that " I took no more pains for those thanks than you took pains to thank me . " that 's as much as to say , Any pains that I take for you is as easy as thanks . If I do not take pity of her , I am a villain ; if I do not love her , I am a Jew . I will go get her picture . &NAME &NAME &NAME &NAME &NUM &NUM &NUM &NAME &CHAR , &NAME &NAME 's &NAME , &NAME 's &NAME , &NAME , &NAME &NUM St. &NAME 's College &NUM &NAME &NAME &NAME DH1 &NAME Department of Geological Sciences University of &NAME

SUBJECT: This was forwarded to me ... The following is an actual question given on a University of &NAME chemistry mid term . The answer was so profound that the professor shared it with colleagues , which is why we now have the pleasure of enjoying it as well . Bonus Question : Is Hell exothermic ( gives off heat ) or endothermic ( absorbs heat ) ? Most of the students wrote proofs of their beliefs using &NAME 's Law , ( gas cools off when it expands and heats up when it is compressed ) or some variant . &NUM student , however , wrote the following : First , we need to know how the mass of Hell is changing in time . So we need to know the rate that souls are moving into Hell and the rate they are leaving . I think that we can safely assume that once a soul gets to hell , it will not leave . Therefore , no souls are leaving . As for how many souls are entering Hell , lets look at the different religions that exist in the world today . Some of these religions state that if you are not a member of their religion , you will go to Hell . Since there are more than one of these religions and since people do not belong to more than &NUM religion , we can project that all souls go to Hell . With birth and death rates as they are , we can expect the number of souls in Hell to increase exponentially . Now , we look at the rate of change of the volume in Hell because &NAME 's law states that in order for the temperature and pressure in Hell to stay the same , the volume of Hell has to expand as souls are added . This gives &NUM possibilities : &NUM If Hell is expanding at slower rate than the rate at which souls enter Hell , then the temperature and pressure in Hell will increase until all Hell breaks loose . &NUM Of course , if Hell is expanding at a rate faster than the increase of souls in Hell , then the temperature and pressure will drop until Hell freezes over . So which is it ? If we accept the postulate given to me by Ms. &NAME &NAME during my Freshman year , ( ... that it will be a cold day in Hell before I sleep with you ) , and take into account the fact that I still have not succeeded in having sexual relations with her , then , # &NUM cannot be true , and thus I am sure that Hell is exothermic and will not freeze . The student received the only A given .

SUBJECT: &NAME : &NAME &NAME Hi &NAME , How is &NAME ? Are you enjoying yourself ? Is it too hot ? I am here . I 'm off on holiday to &NAME soon . I went down to see the flat yesterday . I had a great day and saw &NAME too . I think the bedrooms all need a coat of paint . The rest of the flat is optional . There are many little holes in the walls &NUM to be precise . We have acquired ( do n't ask me how ! ) an ironing board and a TV table which are not in the official inventory . There were no letters for you in the post box . Have we decided finally on bedroom allocation ? If it 's what I think it is then &NAME 's room smells of smoke . No , I have n't been careless with those matches House + fire usually damaged clothes etc It 's cigarette smoke . Most of the curtains do n't match . In the living area there are &NUM darkish blue two-seater settees . The fridge has a minor defect . We have a telephone socket ! ! ! It 's in the hall and there is a telephone ( extremely old , disgusting , dirty , unhygienic , will be disposed of as soon as I remember the rubber gloves type ) but the line is not connected . The little intercom system with the front door is fun ! &NAME and I played around with it for a while . We need air freshener musty smell in most areas . No bed linen , duvets , pillows etc. are provided . There are no headboards on the beds , which are thick metal and extremely ugly I 'll be bringing a valance . The toilet makes a noise like an aeroplane taking off . ( At least it 's not an elephant trumpeting this year ! ) The windows are quite nice . There is a cool little spy-hole in the flat door &NAME and I played with that too . However , all in all it 's not to bad a flat at all . Life shall be exciting ! The flat address is ; &NAME &CHAR , &NAME &NAME 's &NAME , &NAME , &NAME 4DS . The electricity works by a meter . There is an electronic key which must be taken down to a power shop and recharged in return for money . There is &pound; &NUM left in our meter . Most flats use &pound; &NUM per week , so we 're rather lucky . We also went to College in search of &NAME 's shirts . He left about &NUM hanging in the bathroom on the last day of term ! Outside his room is basically a builder 's yard ! The floors are up , etc Unfortunately we could n't find the shirts , but they may be in a lock-up so do n't give up hope yet ! I also went to the &NAME bank and enquired about flat accounts . Interesting . We shall need to discuss that nearer the time . Basically we need &NUM other person to operate it . Anyway , I 'm off on holiday early Saturday morning . E-mail silence for nearly &NUM weeks how awful ! Hope your are having a really good time over there and are not bored by all this flat stuff . I just thought I 'd send it anyway as I sent it to &NAME and &NAME ( does she get an &CHAR on the end of her name too ? ) I shall send you a postcard whilst on my holidays , I have your address .

SUBJECT: Chat ? iso-8859-1 ? &CHAR ? Reschedule3F ? Dear &NAME , &NAME , and &NAME , I would like to ask if you would mind not chatting tomorrow evening ( Sunday ) until &NAME , as I will be atchurch from 6pm . I hope this is coinvenient let me know if it is not . Still 'marshallbees chatroom . However , it would be much better if you could all get netscape instant &NAME ( &WEBSITE ) by then .

SUBJECT: &NAME is ? iso-8859-1 ? &CHAR ? Good3F ? Hi &NAME ! I guess you could n't make it last night . Never mind , I 'm sure &NAME will arrange another opportunity . Anyway , in the end , &NAME , &NAME , &NAME and I turned up . We talked for about an hour . An uninvited guest arrived , calling herself " &NAME . We do n't know who she was , but she was very nasty and called us names , like " elitists and " cliquey ( only she called it " clicky and &NAME corrected her ) . &NAME told her she was delighted to be an elitist if it meant she could spell correctly . Then we all told her to go away and learn to spell , and I told her to learn grammar too . It was quite amusing , and &NAME was quite rude towards her ! ( By the way , &NAME says his computer automatically changes his words to what he really means to say hence the interesting combinations of letters issuing forth from his direction . ) I just hope we do n't actually know Miss " &NAME . It would be awful if it turned out to be someone we 'd invited to chat it was n't you was it ? Life in &NAME is good . It feels very isolated to live up here in &NAME sometimes . There was another beautiful sunset here this evening but not as nice as the &NUM last Monday . " I can see my breath when I breathe because it is so cold . - &NAME , inside your house ? ! That is an unenviable situation . Please be consoled by the fact that the temperature here has been consistently below &NUM for over the last &NUM days . The ground is as hard as &NAME 's rocks . It is nice that there is some beautiful white frost , but it 's too cold for snow so that 's unfortunate . So , are you well ? What have you been doing for the past few days ? I 've been doing something I never thought possible . I now actually ENJOY organic chemistry ! ! ! This is wonderful news and means that I might not fail my exams at the end of the year ! I did absolutely none of it all last year ( even though it counted for a third of the course ) but have now found that it is actually quite simple and good fun ! This afternoon I synthesised cocaine and opium ( on PAPER ) . I did n't work today even though I thought I was going to be . Instead I am probably working tomorrow and Wednesday . What hours do you work at the post office ? Do you have to get up at 5: 15am like &NAME does ? If you do then that means you 'll be getting plenty of practice for next term. ( ! ) I agree that your dad 's joke [ [ you are ] looking for a first class male ] is original . " Has your mum been keeping the house to its usual standards ? My mum does not keep this house to my standards I do . However , I have been helping her to wallpaper last week very boring ! I am glad you are enjoying / being challenged by " Too busy not to pray . I hope all your family is well and that you have a lovely Christmas . See you , &NAME

Thanks to those of you who 've already sent me ( several ! ) emails ! ! Lovely to hear from you ! ! Sorry that I have not yet replied , but there is a tale to tell . Firstly , I forgot to bring my phone connection wire home so I ca n't use my computer to access my email . Secondly , that means that I have to use my dads . Thirdly , he 's ALWAYS on the computer , so I have had no chance until now - while he 's off establishing law and order in the magistrates courts of this fair ( ! ) city . OK , so what have I been doing ? Not much . Stressed horribly over my &NAME project on monday and Tuesday ( while still in &NAME ) . The tutor ( who I went to see several times ) conceded that I have a " rather nasty data set " . He 's telling me ! ! ! ? ? ? ? Hmmmmm. . . ... Otherwise , the last few days in &NAME were fun . Came home on Wed morning leaving our flat very spic and span ( except the oven : sorry &NAME ! ) . Flopped . &NAME is just the same as ever : mam is the BEST , dad is dead busy , and &NAME is obsessed with her A-levels . For all you people who suffered maths A-level and were tortured to death by Pure modules , well - my sister achieved the unthinkable of &NUM in her &NAME exam . &NAME ! So , other than going through mountains of washing , tidying my room , cooking the meals , and going shopping , I have done very little else . Oh , I 've coughed hundreds of times . Played football in the church hall yesterday . Went to church prayer meeting on Wed night and had a massive debate about communion ( &NAME and &NAME will get what I mean ! ) . Went to see 'Miss &NAME " at the cinema . Actually , I guess I 've done quite a bit . And HEY ! ! ! ! ! I 'm going to &NAME in less than &NUM weeks time ! ! &NAME ! ! &NAME ( my sister ) has organised it all and is even paying for me ! ! How exciting ! ( Yes , &NAME - I am excited ! ) I went to the bank yesterday and ordered my foreign currency , and this morning I need to go and book some train tickets to &NAME . &NAME ! And another exciting thing is going to unfold today . My sister &NAME is on the train up from &NAME at this very minute , and no one else in the family knows . It 's a surpise for my mam for mothers day . &NAME stuff , so I need to be quick so that I can go and meet her . &NAME this is a group emaily thing - I 'll try to write to you all individually very soon , but I 'm pushed for time to write this stuff out again and again . Here 's some personal bits : * &NAME : You 're in &NAME are n't you ? ? Hope you 're having a great time ! * &NAME : hope you 're having fun little Muppet ! The flowers I gave you are now happily blooming away in our sitting room here at home ! * &NAME : Get well wishes to that computer of yours . KEEP IT REAL ! * &NAME : cheers for the email .

SUBJECT: To someone who 's seen a mouse Hi &NAME , You saw a mouse ! How wonderful ! I 've never seen a mouse in my life . Despite living in the country , all animals seem to know they ought to keep away from me . I must have been horrid for you , especially at &NAME 38am , now if it had been &NUM : &NUM then that would have been quite different I expect . However , it also is quite amusing ! Just to make you feel depressed I 've only had &NUM day off from revision since I came back from &NAME . Although I 'm sure you 're much more relaxed than I am . Say hello to your little sister &NAME , ( and &NAME ) her greetings in your e-mail were funny . Well , what have I been doing since I last saw you Firstly , it was nice to see you and &NAME before you left a week ago last Sunday . However , I did n't think you 'd all be leaving so swiftly . I stayed up to 2am on Sunday ( strictly Monday ) talking be candlelight to &NAME and &NAME about various trivia . It was great fun . On Tuesday &NAME , &NAME , &NAME , &NAME and I went to " Pizza Hut " , where I consumed &NUM slices of pizza , equalling &NAME ! I was over-full afterwards though . Later , on Monday evening , in that exiting focal point of all our lives , &NAME &CHAR , an interesting event occurred . Well , &NAME invited &NAME and &NAME and &NUM first year CU girls ( &NAME and &NAME ) for dinner . The meal was most delicious , and afterwards one of the first years ( &NAME ) was given the opportunity to cut &NAME 's golden locks - a most amusing incident indeed . The poor unfortunate girl was halfway through the task when she accidentally cut some of &NAME 's ear off . Now , you know what &NAME is like when he gets angry about something Well actually , he did n't assault her , but he yelled and almost cursed about it for a substantial number of minutes . I think the blood contrasted beautifully with his pale complexion . So &NAME now has a mutilated ear , something he will doubtless cherish as it was done at the hands of one of his favoured girls . Seriously though , it was only a small &NAME . On Tuesday I managed to clean most of the flat , including the shower and bathroom . I also walked to the science site to visit the library and show my friend where the &NAME department was . In addition to that I defrosted and cleaned our fridge / freezer , and also cleaned my room with the utmost thoroughness . After that I had to pack my room , and as a result of my hectic morning , after busying myself with all this running around , I had to rush frantically to the railway station . I arrived on the platform , much out of breath due to the rather weighty nature of my bags , to see the train pulling out of the station . My heart sank , as the next train was not due for at least an hour . Thankfully it was not my train , which had been delayed by the ineptitude of &NAME by &NUM minutes . This was &NUM time when I was thankful for inefficiency . Eventually my train arrived and I embarked upon my journey , sad to leave &NAME . My train was then delayed by vandalising children on the railway track . I arrived in &NAME over &NUM minutes late , but still in &NUM piece and much calmer than I had been while rushing to try and catch my train . On Wednesday evening , after getting home , I had a power cut .. At &NAME &NAME I was gaily about to check my e-mail , when the computer switched off and I was plunged into darkness . We proceeded to eat our dinner by the light of oil lamps . We lit our fire and &NUM the played the piano by candlelight for half an hour . It was very beautiful , but could get boring quite easily . I then went up to my room , oil lamp in hand , and began to study . At 8pm the electricity came back on and I succeeded in checking my e-mail . Since then I have not been doing much except revising . On Sunday we went up to visit my Grandmother in &NAME . It was the first time I 'd seen the sun since &NAME . Today and yesterday I 've been working in my dad 's shop in &NAME . It is very quiet and affords me ample opportunity for revision . It 's great to have a job where you get paid to revise ! On Thursday I 'm going down to &NAME for the day , would you like me to forward any of your post which I assume will be there ? &NAME tells me you had an interesting trip to &NAME 'Miss &NAME has now left , and therein lies a story ; I was taking her to &NAME to drop her off with her brother , and she assumed that it would be easy enough to find the place because she knew what it was called - &NAME Halls . Thus , she did not ask for directions , and upon arriving in &NAME , she realised that it was somewhat bigger than she had expected and we would perhaps not be able to just " find " the place by knowing its name ! And so , &NUM people , a number of text messages and an hour later we eventually found our destination ! Anyway , she is there now and I am emailing you from my living room where &NAME is currently residing . " Most amusing ! I hope you are well and enjoying your 'resting " . Email me back . I 'm going off to &NAME &NAME on Thursday week , so I 'll send you a postcard . Best wishes , &NAME &NAME Thanks for e-mailing - I was shocked , it 's not 1st April " till Sunday ! Remember to eat lots ! &NAME As you know , &NAME is unwell . Perhaps you would like to send her a get well card . A few people are . &NAME has sent an e-getwell . I would be quite amusing .

SUBJECT: a little message Dear &NAME , Oh I do dislike that silly " office assistant " creature that always pops up and tells me that " it looks like you are writing a letter " . Really , I do n't need help to write a letter ! Anyway , what was camp like ? Did you get my text message ? It was good to speak to you last weekend . I had a lovely time at &NAME 's and really enjoyed it . My week was further improved by discovering that I was given Thursday and Friday off work since they literally had no work for me to do . All my painting and tidying was finished , and the harvest was still slow to start . I downloaded Third Day 's song that always seemed to be being played in the flat last year and am listening to it as I type . I like it . I went for a walk on the beach we all visited when the flat came to seek out &NAME . It was gloriously sunny and I enjoyed my pleasant walk . I searched for any remains of our campfire , but to no avail . All traces of our illegal activity have been obliterated . Was camp tiring ? Are you glad to be home once more ? Looking forward to seeing you again net term , and perhaps before if you decide to invite people down to your house . Bye , &NAME 
SUBJECT: An Ode to a Vacuum Cleaner Dear &NAME . &NAME , I have n't emailed you in nearly a month ! That 's one of the joys of having lists and organised virtual filing systems . What can I be thinking ! Well , your comment when chatting ( briefly ) a few nights ago prompted me to put fingers to keys and correct a most erroneous sentence . You wrote " it 's me your favourite flatmate from last year " . Now , whilst it is nice that you think this , I feel I must clarify the situation by stating that you were , unfortunately , not my favourite flatmate . Do n't get me wrong , you were right up there in the top &NUM , but the position of first had to go to &NAME . He and I spent so much quality time together . I turned to him when sad and lonely , when happy and full of cleaning energy , when in despair , when in need of comforting , when joyful , when being chased by Canadians intent upon my destruction he was there . He was with me through the best of times and the worst of times . &CHAR constant companion throughout the year . I ( sniff ) even wrote the blue slip for his bag-transplant . ( &NAME breaks down , overcome with emotion . ) Oh poor &NAME ! &NAME and &NAME rarely turned him on , although it is fair to say &NAME did occasionally . I believe you spoke to him with quiet words of wisdom when he was feeling empty and dustless . ( That is a hypothesis only . ) How I shall miss his cheerful face and the musical sound of his whirring voice . He had a voracious appetite , as befits a vacuum cleaner , but when it came to &NAME 's room I must plainly admit that he confessed it was more than he could stomach . Do not for a minute think that &NAME was weak because of this . He was more willing a vacuum cleaner than any I have ever met , but there are just some things yes , there are things , Canadian things . I shall never forget his faithful way of following me around the flat . Like a dog on a lead he appeared to all to be glued to my heels . All who knew &NAME closely , and it was a very select body I can tell you , realised that he was powered by an extraordinary force . His vitality , &NAME , willingness to serve and ever-ready smile were due to his life source - " the socket " . &NAME was always connected to " the socket " . Without it , he just seemed to break down - no music , no appetites . Some may laugh , but &NAME knew to what he owed his existence . A lesson it would do well for us to learn if we want to live as &NAME did . An ode to a vacuum cleaner . I never thought I 'd miss one so much . I probably wo n't. Hope you are having a lovely holiday with &NAME Enjoy the weekend at &NAME 's. Very best wishes , &NAME

SUBJECT: Marshallbees Dear &NAME , Here is a link to the illustrious Marshallbees website ... &WEBSITE I have no idea why it is so long . Have a nice day ! &NAME hello everyone , a tired &NAME writing to you here just to let you know that I am alive and well and slowly becoming accustomed to life in &NAME , and even managing to ride my bike around town without falling off or wobbling most of the time ! I am telling you all now that unless you want the shock of your life then avoid &NAME courses at all costs . ... I think I have done more work in the last &NUM weeks than I did in &NUM years at &NAME . ... At the moment I am in the computer room working on a power point and a presentation for tomorrow . . ... I am definitely not the intellectual equal of the people I am working with and so I am finding it hard to follow them at times . ... anyway . ... This morning I had a great lecture on classroom management and in general the course is REALLY interesting and the school I 'm at is also cool although I have to get up at &NUM &NUM in order to get there in the morning . . ... a bit of a shock to the system I can tell you ! My mentor is this lovely lady called &NAME who I already think is better than sliced bread . She is just fab . Anyway , life here on the whole is good although I have had times of high stress and overwhelmment and also lots of longing to be in &NAME again with all my lovely friends and safe &NAME &NAME college to hide in. ... but each day is a new challenge here and I keep reminding myself to face them instead of running away scared ! &NAME and &NAME ( my housemates ) are just SUPER and the house is great . I have also met some other nice people and I especially like all the people who go to my school ( very ordinary and non intellectual , very &NAME friendly ! ) &NAME , I 'd better get on with my presentation , sorry for the lack of communication over the summer but I will be always on the computers now and promise to make an endaevour to reply to any messages . My new e-mail address is &EMAIL so please reply to that . . ... thanks !

SUBJECT: News from &NAME ... Hi &NAME ! First of all , thank you very much for your postcard . It was good to hear from you . Hope you are happily settled into life in &NAME once more . &NAME and Aunt &NAME have been trying to search for any articles you may have published , but unfortunately we came up with a blank ; or more correctly , the opposite of a blank . The computer returned an excess of &NUM million articles citing &NAME &NAME . You must have been rather busy ! This week has seen an unusual lack of computer activity from &NAME , due mainly to the fact that we acquired a malicious virus . This despicable programme stopped us from using any other programmes - including the internet . &NAME &NAME managed to download a worm at his place of work which speedily remedied the situation ! &NAME is going back to &NAME on Monday and is looking forward to finishing his grain-testing job this Friday . He has found it increasingly monotonous . &NAME on the other hand is still enjoying what can be most kindly described as a rather relaxed existence - Aunt &NAME does n't hold with these euphemisms . We have been able to persuade him to write out a few job applications , but still await any positive feedback . What do you think of the world situation &NAME ? Aunt &NAME 's views pervade this household and an air of impending doom lurks around each corner . She already has &NAME and &NAME conscripted . She is a very optimistic lady , as I 'm sure you know . Seriously though ( Aunt &NAME 's typing this bit ) what do you think about &NAME &NUM ? Aunt &NAME told us someone in your church encouraged study of it . On a lighter note , we hope you are making progress with your research . &NAME will be keeping an eye on the journals . Do let him know when your research is published , and he will send a copy to Aunt &NAME for proof-reading . On the social side , hope you are keeping all the girls at bay . Uncle &NAME says " Hello ! " - he cannot think of anything humorous to say tonight so you have been left with Aunt &NAME 's efforts . After Sunday we will not have access to the internet , so if you reply &NAME will send a copy to the rest of us from &NAME . However , &NAME will be pleased to have correspondence from you also . Okay , this is it for now . Meantime , look after yourself , enjoy yourself and be good . Your loving Aunt , Uncle and cousins - &NAME , &NAME , &NAME & &NAME .

Your accomodation idea sounds good . They have booked me into &NAME &NAME 's Hall for the first week ( they only take week bookings , max ) , but I would be there a second and maybe third week . I could ask them to cancel the week 's booking . Do you know roughly how much it would cost in your friend 's house ? I had thought to stay 1-21st &NAME , but may have to come home a little earlier , depending on flights ... His house is probably not too far away from where I have to work ( Park 's Road - Department of Materials ) , but it may be a good idea to check this , just in case !

SUBJECT: Re : Hi &NAME , Thanks for getting in touch . Here 's the deal on the room : I live in a house with &NUM other undergraduate guys . Our term ends on the 30th November , and I will be going home to &NAME sometime shortly thereafter . So there will be a room free in our house . You are very welcome to use it for as long as you like over the Christmas period , until you can find somewhere more permanent to stay . However , I expect I will be around in &NAME " til about the 3rd of December , so it may be that the first couple nights someone will have to sleep on the floor . After that though , there should be no problems . I think my housemates may stay around a bit longer than me , so you 'll have some company in the house . There is no need to pay for the room . In fact , it is n't even allowed as one of the stipulations of our contract is no sub-letting . So the only " cost " is doing the dishes now and again ! I 've just looked up where the Dept. of Materials is in &NAME , and it 's a fair way away from our house ( we 're in &NAME &NAME , it 's in &NAME &NAME ) . I would estimate it to be a good &NUM minute walk . However , a bike would take this down to about &NUM minutes . So , if you ca n't find a place closer to the Department or are willing to put up with the distance then my room is yours ! Do let me know what you decide , and we can work out the details . Best wishes , &NAME <QUOTE> Dear &NAME , &NAME gave me your e-mail and said that he had been talking to you about the possibility of renting a room in your house in December . I 'm not sure what &NAME has already told you , but I 'm hoping to come to &NAME on Dec. 1st to work in the Department of Materials ( Parks Road ) . I would like somewhere for between &NUM / &NUM weeks at the beginning until I find a more permanent place to stay . &NAME said that your room may be free .

It 's been a very interesting and useful experience and the work is n't too boring either . I 'm going down to &NAME tomorrow to visit a friend for the weekend . Life is busy ! I 'm looking forward to term starting again as it will be nice to get into the routine of academia again . It will also be good to have some other people to live with ! Next term I 'm living with &NUM completely different people although I do know them a little . But it 's not &NAME et &NAME any more unfortunately ! My new flatmates are in the year below me because nearly all of my year have graduated now since they were all doing BSc 's. I 'm not sure who 's been telling you I cook &NUM course meals ... ( ! ) but I guess it 's someone who 's been talking to &NAME . &NAME is my personal marketing director . Yes , I did send your mum an email so I 'm glad she was pleased to receive it . I usually have to write them at work though as I have no internet access for my computer at my flat . Anyway , must finish off some work in the lab before I go home ... Have a good weekend . &NAME 
SUBJECT: Re : Hi Thanks for the e-mail , &NAME ! Sorry I 'm quite slow in replying ! Glad to know things are well at work etc. Not long until the new term starts again ... Will you be living with &NAME and friends next year ? I almost met &NAME , as he was to come to a wedding here with &NAME and then stay overnight at the &NUM &NAME &NAME &NAME ( ummm , maybe just half a star for meals , but &NUM starts for entertainment ! ) . Anyway , it was a pity that plans changed and he was not able to come . Anyway , I hear you cook &NUM course meals for your friends . That should be good if you ever come to visit - I can set the table and provide a friendly atmosphere while you provide dinner ( &NUM courses would be fine ) ! &SMILEY I hear you and Mum have been e-mailing each other .

So ... you 've been trying to track me down and found some pictures at my web address ... &NAME me to dispell any ideas that I am faintly interested in &NAME by telling you they are only there as a favour to a friend who took them and no longer has an IT account since he just graduated this summer .

I 'm sure you 'll be ecstatic to hear I 've not yet renouced my faith ( ! ) and it 's still as vibrant as ever . You can keep the goldfish . Talk about unsporting behaviour &NAME &NAME ! You 've neglected to keep in contact with me ! ( Well , that 's my point of view ... ! ) No , seriously though , I was intending to email you sometime this month ( &NAME , &NAME ... ) .

SUBJECT: Hi Dear &NAME , Thanks for your card I got it this morning . The chocolate was very nice and I have already eaten some of it . I am now out of hospital ( as of Tuesday afternoon ) and am very much enjoying being at home . I am not feeling too bad at all and will hopefully be going back down to &NAME on Sunday . I absolutely hate hospitals , medication and all the various trappings . However thankfully I did n't have to stay there too long this time and by the time I left my lung was &NUM up , so that 's good . I have to go back for a check-up in a week and a half 's time . How are you ? What is life in &NAME like ? Mum tells me you 're still busy entertaining and Aunt &NAME tells me you had &NAME down to stay for a few nights . I 've never managed to get down to visit you yet but maybe one of these days I 'll make it ! One of my close friends , &NAME &NAME and &NAME &NAME are now living in &NAME . They both graduated from &NAME this summer and &NAME is doing a &NUM year law conversion course whilst &NAME is working in a telephone call centre ( a favourite destination for &NAME graduates ! ) . You might bump in to them sometime ; they go to &NAME Ebb 's church ( same one as &NAME , &NAME 's fianc' &CHAR ) . I am enjoying having a break from studying at the moment , but will need to be getting back to it soon as I have my final exams at the end of this term . Last Wednesday I began my Master 's project ; the aim of which is to make a molecular transistor . I think I 'm going to enjoy it and the research group seem really nice , as well as my supervisor . Well , I 'd better go now as this is me exhausted ! &NAME to see you soon . &NAME

Hope you are back at &NAME by now and getting caught up with your studies for your finals . Life in &NAME is going well . I 've quite a lot of work to do at the moment , with trying to get my PhD write-up finished , the new job , etc. Also , I 'm trying to fit in some trips to the &NAME club here , church meetings , climbing ( trying to learn ! ) and keeping in touch with my new friends here and my friends at home . Its a bit frantic at the moment but should calm down considerably after Christmas ( hopefully ! ! ) My new house is great - flatmates are really good fun and no trouble at all in the house - I think I 'm probably the messiest one ! !
