okay [ga] (sw2121a-ws97-l-0001)
could you tell me what you think contributes most to [%hesitation] air pollution (sw2121a-ws97-l-0002)
[%hesitation] well you talked about [%hesitation] [volcanos] (sw2121a-ws97-l-0003)
i'm not sure how many active [volcanos] there are now and and what the amount of material that they do [%hesitation] put into the atmosphere (sw2121a-ws97-l-0004)
i think probably the greatest cause is [%hesitation] vehicles especially around cities (sw2121a-ws97-l-0005)
[%hesitation] [%hesitation] do you live right in the city itself (sw2121a-ws97-l-0006)
[%hesitation] okay (sw2121a-ws97-l-0007)
so can can you notice (sw2121a-ws97-l-0008)
well it's it's (sw2121a-ws97-l-0009)
i live in a rural area (sw2121a-ws97-l-0010)
[%hesitation] it's mainly farms and [%hesitation] no heavy industry (sw2121a-ws97-l-0011)
[%hesitation] [attleboro] itself (sw2121a-ws97-l-0012)
i live in rhode island (sw2121a-ws97-l-0013)
and it's in the north (sw2121a-ws97-l-0014)
i live up in the [%hesitation] northeast corner (sw2121a-ws97-l-0015)
and [attleboro] sits in just over the line where t i's plant is (sw2121a-ws97-l-0016)
but there isn't a lot of heavy industry (sw2121a-ws97-l-0017)
there's the [freeways] (sw2121a-ws97-l-0018)
and we get occasional (sw2121a-ws97-l-0019)
it depends which way the winds blowing from boston because we're in like about forty miles south of boston (sw2121a-ws97-l-0020)
so we'll pick up that (sw2121a-ws97-l-0021)
we live about twenty miles away from the state airport (sw2121a-ws97-l-0023)
and i notice the fly patterns now of the [jets] as they're getting bigger (sw2121a-ws97-l-0024)
they're [swinging] wider so that now they're coming over the over the our homes (sw2121a-ws97-l-0025)
and it seems like [%hesitation] [%hesitation] we're catching all that [residue] (sw2121a-ws97-l-0026)
i'm not sure if it's [kerosene] or what that's dropping (sw2121a-ws97-l-0027)
but other than that you know we don't have the unless we're catching it from the midwest the emissions you know from the power plants [%hesitation] (sw2121a-ws97-l-0028)
yeah (sw2121a-ws97-l-0029)
yeah (sw2121a-ws97-l-0030)
we generate (sw2121a-ws97-l-0031)
one of our our biggest electrical plants in rhode island uses coal to [%hesitation] generate electricity (sw2121a-ws97-l-0032)
there doesn't seem to be much emission from them (sw2121a-ws97-l-0033)
but i'm not sure about the rest of the country (sw2121a-ws97-l-0034)
is that right junk [%hesitation] (sw2121a-ws97-l-0036)
yeah (sw2121a-ws97-l-0037)
surprise surprise (sw2121a-ws97-l-0038)
yeah (sw2121a-ws97-l-0039)
there there must be [%hesitation] [%hesitation] some of the some of the [%hesitation] [%hesitation] larger plants up [%hesitation] up around one twenty eight (sw2121a-ws97-l-0040)
[%hesitation] we've got reports that [%hesitation] (sw2121a-ws97-l-0041)
during the night too like they blow off their their stacks from [%hesitation] the [boiler] house for [powerhouses] (sw2121a-ws97-l-0042)
and they do that at night too because employees been complaining that the cars have been [pitted] and you know spots all over them (sw2121a-ws97-l-0043)
so you're right (sw2121a-ws97-l-0044)
they could do something [%hesitation] about that i guess (sw2121a-ws97-l-0045)
how are your [%hesitation] your lakes (sw2121a-ws97-l-0046)
and [%hesitation] (sw2121a-ws97-l-0047)
they have (sw2121a-ws97-l-0048)
acid rain (sw2121a-ws97-l-0049)
yeah (sw2121a-ws97-l-0050)
that's that's what i was [%hesitation] (sw2121a-ws97-l-0051)
yeah (sw2121a-ws97-l-0052)
no (sw2121a-ws97-l-0053)
didn't they just have an article though on [%hesitation] (sw2121a-ws97-l-0054)
they were dumping [lime] (sw2121a-ws97-l-0055)
up upstate new york somewhere [%hesitation] over over huge areas (sw2121a-ws97-l-0056)
didn't and they thought that was more beneficial because you know it some of it does soak in (sw2121a-ws97-l-0057)
and some of it runs off right away into the in to the streams and rivers (sw2121a-ws97-l-0058)
and some of the fish who are supposedly making a comeback (sw2121a-ws97-l-0059)
i can't remember where (sw2121a-ws97-l-0060)
i read that recently somewhere (sw2121a-ws97-l-0061)
and i can't remember where (sw2121a-ws97-l-0062)
but i thought it was up there (sw2121a-ws97-l-0063)
so that's interesting because new hampshire and parts of vermont [%hesitation] they showed pictures of of extensive tree damage that they [attributed] to acid rain (sw2121a-ws97-l-0064)
[%hesitation] you kind of think it's something else then (sw2121a-ws97-l-0065)
of they didn't say they didn't say what though (sw2121a-ws97-l-0066)
they just said they (sw2121a-ws97-l-0067)
and [%hesitation] i've noticed over the past say maybe five or six years [%hesitation] (sw2121a-ws97-l-0022)
well it's hard to say (sw2121b-ws97-l-0001)
i mean while it's certainly the case that things like automobiles and factories [%hesitation] pollute a lot [%hesitation] if you look at how much pollution is say kicked up by an active [volcano] [%hesitation] it's certainly less than clear that anything man can do in this sort of scale of things has much effect at all (sw2121b-ws97-l-0002)
what do you think (sw2121b-ws97-l-0003)
[uhhuh] (sw2121b-ws97-l-0004)
[%hesitation] no (sw2121b-ws97-l-0005)
i'm more out in the suburbs (sw2121b-ws97-l-0006)
but i certainly work near a city (sw2121b-ws97-l-0007)
how about you (sw2121b-ws97-l-0008)
[uhhuh] (sw2121b-ws97-l-0009)
[uhhuh] (sw2121b-ws97-l-0010a)
oh i see (sw2121b-ws97-l-0010b)
[uhhuh] (sw2121b-ws97-l-0011)
[uhhuh] (sw2121b-ws97-l-0012)
[uhhuh] (sw2121b-ws97-l-0013a)
yeah (sw2121b-ws97-l-0013b)
like from the coal (sw2121b-ws97-l-0014)
hum (sw2121b-ws97-l-0015)
yeah (sw2121b-ws97-l-0016)
i've noticed locally a major problem is [kodak] (sw2121b-ws97-l-0017)
[%hesitation] it's interesting (sw2121b-ws97-l-0018)
because in order to [%hesitation] keep with the e p a standards which which tend to be visible [%hesitation] what's coming out of your [smokestack] they do all their emissions at night (sw2121b-ws97-l-0019)
[%hesitation] so people get up (sw2121b-ws97-l-0020)
yeah (sw2121b-ws97-l-0021)
people get up in the morning in that neighborhood (sw2121b-ws97-l-0022)
and they've got this black ash on their cars which you know seems to be (sw2121b-ws97-l-0023)
yeah (sw2121b-ws97-l-0024)
i mean i really think that if the e p a had anything on the ball they'd go in there with a few [phosphorus] [grenades] light up the sky [photograph] the emissions at that point and [%hesitation] you know (sw2121b-ws97-l-0025)
[uhhuh] (sw2121b-ws97-l-0026)
right (sw2121b-ws97-l-0027)
[uhhuh] (sw2121b-ws97-l-0028)
right (sw2121b-ws97-l-0029)
yeah (sw2121b-ws97-l-0030)
yeah (sw2121b-ws97-l-0031)
yeah (sw2121b-ws97-l-0032)
that seems a little ridiculous (sw2121b-ws97-l-0033)
oh it'd been getting cleaner (sw2121b-ws97-l-0034)
sure (sw2121b-ws97-l-0035)
but [%hesitation] yeah (sw2121b-ws97-l-0036)
i'm not sure how much the water pollution is is directly related to the air pollution other than acid rain (sw2121b-ws97-l-0037)
yeah (sw2121b-ws97-l-0038)
i mean the stuff i've read recently in technology review basically [indicates] that acid rain may be a little bit [%hesitation] [overstated] that a lot of the die off they've seen in forests may not really be due to acid rain at all (sw2121b-ws97-l-0039)
[%hesitation] yeah (sw2121b-ws97-l-0040)
i'm not an expert (sw2121b-ws97-l-0041)
[%hesitation] (sw2121b-ws97-l-0042)
i haven't read that (sw2121b-ws97-l-0043)
oh yeah (sw2121b-ws97-l-0044)
[uhhuh] (sw2121b-ws97-l-0045)
yeah (sw2121b-ws97-l-0046)
interest (sw2121b-ws97-l-0047)
[uhhuh] (sw2121b-ws97-l-0048)
huh (sw2121b-ws97-l-0049)
well that's what the [environmentalists] were claiming in this article (sw2121b-ws97-l-0050)
[%hesitation] just about any kind of music except acid rock (sw2131a-ws97-l-0001)
i i don't care for acid rock (sw2131a-ws97-l-0002)
but [%hesitation] (sw2131a-ws97-l-0004)
just about any kind of music (sw2131a-ws97-l-0005)
i even like classical music (sw2131a-ws97-l-0006)
yeah (sw2131a-ws97-l-0007)
yeah (sw2131a-ws97-l-0008)
i grew up with hank snow and [lefty] [frizzell] and hank williams and all of those old country and western songs (sw2131a-ws97-l-0009)
but [%hesitation] i (sw2131a-ws97-l-0010)
did you happen to see last night the special on channel two with james [galway] (sw2131a-ws97-l-0011)
oh (sw2131a-ws97-l-0012)
that was fabulous (sw2131a-ws97-l-0013)
when (sw2131a-ws97-l-0014)
yeah (sw2131a-ws97-l-0015)
when he played danny boy it just almost brought tears to your eyes because he can make that flute sing (sw2131a-ws97-l-0016)
yeah (sw2131a-ws97-l-0017)
and [%hesitation] it was tremendous (sw2131a-ws97-l-0018)
yeah (sw2131a-ws97-l-0020)
yeah (sw2131a-ws97-l-0021)
[uhhuh] (sw2131a-ws97-l-0022)
and it was [%hesitation] mostly all [irish] tunes (sw2131a-ws97-l-0023)
but [%hesitation] i grew up with country and western (sw2131a-ws97-l-0003)
they had a band with him that [%hesitation] had a [harpist] and another flute and then guy that played the [bagpipes] plus the [%hesitation] tin whistle and a couple of [violins] and a drum [{] [{] [and-] [/] [@] [}] [/] [@] [}] (sw2131a-ws97-l-0024)
and they they played all the [irish] [jigs] and so forth (sw2131a-ws97-l-0025)
it was just fabulous (sw2131a-ws97-l-0026)
yeah (sw2131a-ws97-l-0027)
yeah (sw2131a-ws97-l-0032)
i love [%hesitation] i [{] [{] [li-] [/] [@] [}] [/] [@] [}] i especially like [instrumentals] (sw2131a-ws97-l-0033)
yeah (sw2131a-ws97-l-0034)
i love to just lay back on the couch and and turn a good good instrumental on and just close my eyes and listen (sw2131a-ws97-l-0035)
i've i never played an instrument in my life (sw2131a-ws97-l-0037)
i've always wanted too (sw2131a-ws97-l-0038)
i've always wished my [%hesitation] parents had forced me to learn the piano or something (sw2131a-ws97-l-0039)
but i i'd just love to be able to go to a party or something and set down at the piano and bang out music (sw2131a-ws97-l-0041)
i guess the closest i've ever come to participating in music is singing in the choir (sw2131a-ws97-l-0043)
yeah (sw2131a-ws97-l-0045)
well like i say the acid rock (sw2131a-ws97-l-0046)
i just do not (sw2131a-ws97-l-0047)
okay i i don't care for rap music [{] [{] [ei-] [/] [@] [}] [/] [@] [}] (sw2131a-ws97-l-0048)
if i can't understand the words i don't want to listen to it (sw2131a-ws97-l-0051)
yeah (sw2131a-ws97-l-0052)
yeah (sw2131a-ws97-l-0053)
right (sw2131a-ws97-l-0054)
and i love [%hesitation] i like the orchestra music too like the boston pops or or anything (sw2131a-ws97-l-0055)
[uhhuh] (sw2131a-ws97-l-0056)
yeah (sw2131a-ws97-l-0057)
yeah (sw2131a-ws97-l-0058)
they're good (sw2131a-ws97-l-0059)
and a we went and saw [%hesitation] les les les [miserables] (sw2131a-ws97-l-0060)
oh the music in that was fantastic (sw2131a-ws97-l-0061)
yeah (sw2131a-ws97-l-0063)
it it [%hesitation] (sw2131a-ws97-l-0064)
i can't remember how far in advance we reserved tickets (sw2131a-ws97-l-0065)
but it was out you know out at the state fair music hall (sw2131a-ws97-l-0066)
and a it was well worth the price (sw2131a-ws97-l-0067)
just just ever so often you know a real a real good one like that one (sw2131a-ws97-l-0070)
we went and saw [%hesitation] i think it was [%hesitation] sugar babies (sw2131a-ws97-l-0072)
that was good (sw2131a-ws97-l-0073)
that had good music in it (sw2131a-ws97-l-0074)
[%hesitation] that one was the one with [%hesitation] mickey [rooney] (sw2131a-ws97-l-0075)
and [%hesitation] oh what's that real oh not real old my wife she is old too [dancer] (sw2131a-ws97-l-0076)

[%hesitation] i don't i don't like acid rock either (sw2131b-ws97-l-0009)
[{]  [{] [-or] [/] [@] [}] [/] [@] [}] i've i grew up in a small town (sw2131b-ws97-l-0010)

yeah (sw2131b-ws97-l-0046)
i was one of the forced ones (sw2131b-ws97-l-0047)
[%hesitation] (sw2131b-ws97-l-0048a)
oh i could never do that (sw2131b-ws97-l-0048b)
i was never that brave (sw2131b-ws97-l-0049)

oh it's it's it's not it's not music (sw2131b-ws97-l-0063)
it's just it's just [%hesitation] [%hesitation] talking in a beat (sw2131b-ws97-l-0064)
it is just it's not exciting at all (sw2131b-ws97-l-0065)
it doesn't it doesn't give you relaxation (sw2131b-ws97-l-0066)
you can't dance to it (sw2131b-ws97-l-0067)
you can't do anything (sw2131b-ws97-l-0068)
yeah (sw2131b-ws97-l-0071)
have you ever been to the to to the dallas symphony (sw2131b-ws97-l-0072)

i i bet it was (sw2131b-ws97-l-0085)
i bet i really bet it was (sw2131b-ws97-l-0086)
is that the only [%hesitation] musical (sw2131b-ws97-l-0087)
do you go see [{] [{] [m-] [/] [@] [}] [/] [@] [}] [{] [{] [m-] [/] [@] [}] [/] [@] [}] a lot of musicals (sw2131b-ws97-l-0088)
yeah (sw2131b-ws97-l-0089)
that that would be that would be nice (sw2131b-ws97-l-0090b)
[%hesitation] (sw2131b-ws97-l-0091a)
was it (sw2131b-ws97-l-0091b)
how how (sw2131b-ws97-l-0092)
i can't i don't know what that's about (sw2131b-ws97-l-0093)
okay (sw2151a-ws97-l-0001)
well i i think it's a pretty good deal (sw2151a-ws97-l-0002)
i think they should either do that or or afford some time to the military or or helping elderly people (sw2151a-ws97-l-0003)
i i you know i think that we have a bunch of elderly folks in the country that could use some help (sw2151a-ws97-l-0004)
and i think that before we expend all our young talent overseas and and helping other countries we ought to perhaps give a little bit of our help to our own folks at home (sw2151a-ws97-l-0005)
and i'm not sure that that's not a bad idea (sw2151a-ws97-l-0006)
and or the military for a year or two wouldn't be bad for (sw2151a-ws97-l-0007)
i think it teaches kids how to grow (sw2151a-ws97-l-0008)
how about yourself (sw2151a-ws97-l-0009)
yeah (sw2151a-ws97-l-0010)
i've i've (sw2151a-ws97-l-0011)
that's really great (sw2151a-ws97-l-0012)
i i really think that both the boy scouts and girl scouts is a excellent two excellent organizations (sw2151a-ws97-l-0013)
you know they kids seem like when they get ten or twelve years old they fall out of that (sw2151a-ws97-l-0014)
and they don't follow it at all you know (sw2151a-ws97-l-0015)
there are very few scouts go on and become eagle scouts (sw2151a-ws97-l-0016)
and and i don't know how the high rank is for the [gals] (sw2151a-ws97-l-0017)
but (sw2151a-ws97-l-0018)
[%hesitation] (sw2151a-ws97-l-0019)
senior (sw2151a-ws97-l-0020)
okay (sw2151a-ws97-l-0021)
so there's not [%hesitation] (sw2151a-ws97-l-0022)
yeah (sw2151a-ws97-l-0023)
they lose interest (sw2151a-ws97-l-0024)
and then when they young young adults there's even less interest there (sw2151a-ws97-l-0025)
they're more for i [{] [{] [gue-] [/] [@] [}] [/] [@] [}] (sw2151a-ws97-l-0026)
not not (sw2151a-ws97-l-0027)
yeah (sw2151a-ws97-l-0028)
[uhhuh] (sw2151a-ws97-l-0029)
you're absolutely right (sw2151a-ws97-l-0030)
i think it's a really a good thing (sw2151a-ws97-l-0031)
i i like to see (sw2151a-ws97-l-0032)
of course there's you know third world countries that can use all kind of help (sw2151a-ws97-l-0033)
but i think we ought to start right here at home (sw2151a-ws97-l-0034)
i'm (sw2151a-ws97-l-0035)
no (sw2151a-ws97-l-0036)
[{] [{] [i-] [/] [@] [}] [/] [@] [}] it (sw2151a-ws97-l-0037)
i think that yeah i think that we need to really address what we've done here (sw2151a-ws97-l-0038)
and and then perhaps even a six month tour overseas that gives them much broader outlook (sw2151a-ws97-l-0039)
well it's been really good (sw2151a-ws97-l-0040)
we talked about this for a few minutes (sw2151a-ws97-l-0041)
and [%hesitation] hopefully we'll have another good topic maybe another call someday (sw2151a-ws97-l-0042)
but i i don't really have too much more to say on this topic i [{] [{] [gue-] [/] [@] [}] [/] [@] [}] (sw2151a-ws97-l-0043)
it we i guess we both agree that it's a good thing that they should do sometime (sw2151a-ws97-l-0044)
well you take care (sw2151a-ws97-l-0045)
and and enjoy the day (sw2151a-ws97-l-0046)
okay (sw2151b-ws97-l-0001)
what do you think about the idea of [%hesitation] kids having to do public service work for a year (sw2151b-ws97-l-0002)
do you think it's a (sw2151b-ws97-l-0003)
yes (sw2151b-ws97-l-0004)
yes (sw2151b-ws97-l-0005)
that's true (sw2151b-ws97-l-0007)
yeah (sw2151b-ws97-l-0008)
[%hesitation] i agree with you (sw2151b-ws97-l-0009)
[%hesitation] [%hesitation] what i'm thinking about is back oh when i was a kid and much earlier than that kids were kind of [%hesitation] (sw2151b-ws97-l-0010)
you know the parents kind of pushed them to join like the boy scouts or girl scouts (sw2151b-ws97-l-0011)
and they do do do do a lot of public service activities (sw2151b-ws97-l-0012)
but these days they're not (sw2151b-ws97-l-0013)
[%hesitation] [{] [{] [pa-] [/] [@] [}] [/] [@] [}] parents aren't encouraging their kids to do things like that (sw2151b-ws97-l-0014)
because when i was in the girl scouts we did a lot of public service things because that's just part [{] [{] [o-] [/] [@] [}] [/] [@] [}] of of the scouting and you know (sw2151b-ws97-l-0015)
they are (sw2151b-ws97-l-0016)
but parents (sw2151b-ws97-l-0017)
yeah (sw2151b-ws97-l-0018)
they do (sw2151b-ws97-l-0019)
oh no (sw2151b-ws97-l-0020)
i i i [%hesitation] (sw2151b-ws97-l-0021)
senior (sw2151b-ws97-l-0022)
oh they're just not (sw2151b-ws97-l-0023)
[%hesitation] once they get into junior high they just not done anymore (sw2151b-ws97-l-0024)
[uhhuh] (sw2151b-ws97-l-0025)
me (sw2151b-ws97-l-0026)
grab (sw2151b-ws97-l-0027)
grab (sw2151b-ws97-l-0028)
grab (sw2151b-ws97-l-0029)
walk (sw2151b-ws97-l-0030)
yeah (sw2151b-ws97-l-0031)
yeah (sw2151b-ws97-l-0032)
[%hesitation] but there's a lot that could be done right here in this country too (sw2151b-ws97-l-0033)
yeah (sw2151b-ws97-l-0034)
[%hesitation] i'm not i'm not so sure that overseas help helping overseas would be such a hot idea for [{] [{] [s-] [/] [@] [}] [/] [@] [}] for [%hesitation] a lot of young [{] [{] [ki-] [/] [@] [}] [/] [@] [}] people (sw2151b-ws97-l-0035)
but [%hesitation] since there is much that needs to be done here (sw2151b-ws97-l-0036)
[uhhuh] (sw2151b-ws97-l-0037)
no (sw2151b-ws97-l-0038)
i i agree with you [{] [{] [tha-] [/] [@] [}] [/] [@] [}] (sw2151b-ws97-l-0039)
yeah (sw2151b-ws97-l-0040)
okay (sw2151b-ws97-l-0041)
you too (sw2151b-ws97-l-0043)
are you on a regular regular exercise program right now (sw2229a-ws97-l-0001)
oh well i'm kind of off and on (sw2229a-ws97-l-0002)
right now i'm kind of off (sw2229a-ws97-l-0003)
okay (sw2229a-ws97-l-0004)
what type of exercise do you do (sw2229a-ws97-l-0005)
okay (sw2229a-ws97-l-0006)
i guess you don't enjoy that very much (sw2229a-ws97-l-0007)
you find that [%hesitation] to be boring (sw2229a-ws97-l-0008)
yeah (sw2229a-ws97-l-0009)
well i'm trying to get back in shape for softball this spring (sw2229a-ws97-l-0010)
but i (sw2229a-ws97-l-0011)
yeah (sw2229a-ws97-l-0012)
i haven't decided whether your whether i want to play yet or not (sw2229a-ws97-l-0013)
i i just bought myself a solo flex machine (sw2229a-ws97-l-0014)
and i don't know if you've seen those advertised on t v (sw2229a-ws97-l-0015)
it's one of those [%hesitation] universal type machines exercise machine (sw2229a-ws97-l-0016)
but i haven't really sat down and used it much yet (sw2229a-ws97-l-0017)
so it's collecting dust right now (sw2229a-ws97-l-0018)
i used to jog somewhat (sw2229a-ws97-l-0019)
[uhhuh] (sw2229a-ws97-l-0020)
well that's good (sw2229a-ws97-l-0021)
yeah (sw2229a-ws97-l-0022)
my parents have a treadmill (sw2229a-ws97-l-0023)
it's (sw2229a-ws97-l-0024)
when i go visit them [%hesitation] i get on that thing every now and then (sw2229a-ws97-l-0025)
[uhhuh] (sw2229a-ws97-l-0026)
i just got the bicycle out today (sw2229a-ws97-l-0027)
and it was real nice outside (sw2229a-ws97-l-0028)
had to get out to do something (sw2229a-ws97-l-0029)
i've been sitting in here in the house [%hesitation] all weekend with a cold (sw2229a-ws97-l-0030)
so i thought i better [%hesitation] better get outside and do something not waste the day (sw2229a-ws97-l-0031)
but [%hesitation] yeah (sw2229a-ws97-l-0032)
i need to start jogging again (sw2229a-ws97-l-0033)
i've always found that to be [%hesitation] [%hesitation] really one of the best forms of exercise (sw2229a-ws97-l-0034)
but it's terribly boring (sw2229a-ws97-l-0035)
and so i really don't ever keep [%hesitation] a program up consistently (sw2229a-ws97-l-0036)
no (sw2229a-ws97-l-0037)
i never have (sw2229a-ws97-l-0038)
well i don't jog enough i think to develop any injuries (sw2229a-ws97-l-0039)
i usually only go about a mile or two (sw2229a-ws97-l-0040)
yeah (sw2229a-ws97-l-0041)
it's it's tough on the joints if you jog on concrete or on asphalt (sw2229a-ws97-l-0042)
it's supposed to be much better if you find [%hesitation] grass or or dirt to jog on (sw2229a-ws97-l-0043)
you have to have the right type of shoes too (sw2229a-ws97-l-0044)
it's very important (sw2229a-ws97-l-0045)
but (sw2229a-ws97-l-0046)
yeah (sw2229a-ws97-l-0047)
i don't have to buy jogging shoes all too often (sw2229a-ws97-l-0048)
mine don't get very much use (sw2229a-ws97-l-0049)
[uhhuh] (sw2229a-ws97-l-0050)
[{]  [{] [-uh] [/] [@] [}] [/] [@] [}] i usually enjoy the exercise i do (sw2229a-ws97-l-0051)
but [%hesitation] like i said i'm just not very consistent about maintaining a a program (sw2229a-ws97-l-0052)
so i'll i'll bicycle (sw2229a-ws97-l-0053)
i get into that for for a little while and maybe go out [%hesitation] on a consistent basis every couple of days and ride a bike for awhile (sw2229a-ws97-l-0054)
but then i'll get tired of doing that and maybe start jogging again and go out three or four nights a week (sw2229a-ws97-l-0055)
but [%hesitation] that gets old too in very short order (sw2229a-ws97-l-0056)
i'm i'm hoping that this [%hesitation] solo flex will [%hesitation] [%hesitation] change things a little bit (sw2229a-ws97-l-0057)
i really need to get on a regular type of program and use that thing on a consistent basis (sw2229a-ws97-l-0058)
yeah (sw2229a-ws97-l-0059)
so maybe if i can get interested in playing softball again this spring i can [%hesitation] start some type of [%hesitation] regular program (sw2229a-ws97-l-0060)
i've always found that that when you write things down and set goals it's a lot easier to keep [%hesitation] keep something going (sw2229a-ws97-l-0061)
[%hesitation] when i was in high school we had a choice of [%hesitation] taking [%hesitation] physical education courses on exercise (sw2229a-ws97-l-0062)
and [%hesitation] one of those involved a six weeks session on a universal machine lifting weights and and [%hesitation] working out like that (sw2229a-ws97-l-0063)
and that was very helpful (sw2229a-ws97-l-0064)
we kept [charts] of our progress and [%hesitation] consistently [%hesitation] increased the amount of resistance so you could see how much you improved over the weeks (sw2229a-ws97-l-0065)
i found that to be [%hesitation] very helpful (sw2229a-ws97-l-0066)
[%hesitation] i need to (sw2229a-ws97-l-0067)
i haven't started yet (sw2229a-ws97-l-0068)
but it's a thought (sw2229a-ws97-l-0069)
sounds like something i should do (sw2229a-ws97-l-0070)
[uhhuh] (sw2229a-ws97-l-0071a)
how often do you [%hesitation] [%hesitation] go out each week on your walking (sw2229a-ws97-l-0071b)
okay (sw2229a-ws97-l-0072)
how far about how far do you go walking (sw2229a-ws97-l-0073)
okay (sw2229a-ws97-l-0074)
yeah that's good (sw2229a-ws97-l-0075)
well they say that walking is just as good if not better then jogging (sw2229a-ws97-l-0076)
yes (sw2229b-ws97-l-0001)
and i hate it (sw2229b-ws97-l-0002)
how about you (sw2229b-ws97-l-0003)
off and on (sw2229b-ws97-l-0004)
well i guess i've been kind of off and on (sw2229b-ws97-l-0005)
i've [%hesitation] had some health problems that have led me to [%hesitation] (sw2229b-ws97-l-0006)
say more on than off (sw2229b-ws97-l-0007)
[%hesitation] i do walking on a treadmill (sw2229b-ws97-l-0008)
[{]  [{] [-uh] [/] [@] [}] [/] [@] [}] and then i do low impact aerobics (sw2229b-ws97-l-0009)
not not really (sw2229b-ws97-l-0010)
yeah (sw2229b-ws97-l-0011)
and time consuming (sw2229b-ws97-l-0012)
i mean it's not just the exercise that's boring and time consuming (sw2229b-ws97-l-0013)
it's [%hesitation] you know afterwards you know (sw2229b-ws97-l-0014)
then you have to take a shower and get cleaned up you know (sw2229b-ws97-l-0015)
no (sw2229b-ws97-l-0016)
do you go through this is this something that you go through like every year (sw2229b-ws97-l-0017)
[uhuh] (sw2229b-ws97-l-0018)
yeah (sw2229b-ws97-l-0019)
a lot of things do that (sw2229b-ws97-l-0020)
i have an [{] [{] [ex-] [/] [@] [}] [/] [@] [}] i had an exercise bike (sw2229b-ws97-l-0021)
i used to have one (sw2229b-ws97-l-0022)
and finally got rid of it because i never used it (sw2229b-ws97-l-0023)
but i do use my treadmill (sw2229b-ws97-l-0024)
yeah (sw2229b-ws97-l-0025)
it's nice because when the weather is bad you can't don't have any excuse (sw2229b-ws97-l-0026)
yeah (sw2229b-ws97-l-0027)
i can't ride a bike (sw2229b-ws97-l-0028)
so (sw2229b-ws97-l-0029)
oh (sw2229b-ws97-l-0030)
yeah (sw2229b-ws97-l-0031)
it's too [{] [{] [ni-] [/] [@] [}] [/] [@] [}] (sw2229b-ws97-l-0032)
it's been too nice of a weekend (sw2229b-ws97-l-0033)
have you ever had any injuries from jogging (sw2229b-ws97-l-0034)
i guess what worries me about jogging is that i hear that it's very hard on your body and and that you know you can end up getting hurt worse (sw2229b-ws97-l-0035)
[uhhuh] (sw2229b-ws97-l-0036)
yeah (sw2229b-ws97-l-0037)
that's not quite so so easy (sw2229b-ws97-l-0038)
yeah (sw2229b-ws97-l-0039)
yeah (sw2229b-ws97-l-0040)
i found that true especially for walking on toes or [fronts] (sw2229b-ws97-l-0041)
well i guess mine breakdown about they say about every six months (sw2229b-ws97-l-0042)
yeah (sw2229b-ws97-l-0043)
yeah (sw2229b-ws97-l-0044)
well don't let it collect dust (sw2229b-ws97-l-0045)
at least exercise while [dusting] it off (sw2229b-ws97-l-0046)
well (sw2229b-ws97-l-0047)
yeah (sw2229b-ws97-l-0048)
[{]  [{] [-that] [/] [@] [}] [/] [@] [}] that'll be good (sw2229b-ws97-l-0049)
[uhhuh] (sw2229b-ws97-l-0050)
oh (sw2229b-ws97-l-0051)
[uhhuh] (sw2229b-ws97-l-0052)
are you going to do that (sw2229b-ws97-l-0053)
well that sounds like something good to do then (sw2229b-ws97-l-0054)
yeah (sw2229b-ws97-l-0055)
nice way to start off the spring get back in shape (sw2229b-ws97-l-0056)
well i do (sw2229b-ws97-l-0057)
i switch every other day (sw2229b-ws97-l-0058)
one day i walk (sw2229b-ws97-l-0059)
and one day i do the aerobics (sw2229b-ws97-l-0060)
well i'm trying to build up my tolerance now (sw2229b-ws97-l-0061)
i just had surgery [%hesitation] less then two months ago (sw2229b-ws97-l-0062)
and right now i'm just a little over about a mile and a half (sw2229b-ws97-l-0063)
but i [{] [{] [j-] [/] [@] [}] [/] [@] [}] try to work up to three miles (sw2229b-ws97-l-0064)
[%hesitation] the causes of crime (sw2335a-ws97-l-0001)
[%hesitation] i think it was [imbalance] of of power in the united states (sw2335a-ws97-l-0002)
that's causing the lower class to rebel (sw2335a-ws97-l-0003)
that's why there's [{] [{] [s-] [/] [@] [}] [/] [@] [}] such high crime (sw2335a-ws97-l-0004)
and [%hesitation] there's crime in [%hesitation] young people because they don't have [{] [{] [ro-] [/] [@] [}] [/] [@] [}] role models (sw2335a-ws97-l-0005)
see too much crime on t v (sw2335a-ws97-l-0006)
and they think it's the way to go (sw2335a-ws97-l-0007)
i know (sw2335a-ws97-l-0008)
what do you think (sw2335a-ws97-l-0009)
[uhhuh] (sw2335a-ws97-l-0010)
yeah (sw2335a-ws97-l-0011)
okay (sw2335a-ws97-l-0012)
yeah (sw2335a-ws97-l-0013)
okay (sw2335a-ws97-l-0014)
yeah (sw2335a-ws97-l-0015)
from anybody else (sw2335a-ws97-l-0016)
yeah (sw2335a-ws97-l-0017)
yeah (sw2335a-ws97-l-0018)
i think i can agree with that too (sw2335a-ws97-l-0020)
that's true (sw2335a-ws97-l-0022)
you got to kind of make [{] [{] [w-] [/] [@] [}] [/] [@] [}] people want to do the right thing (sw2335a-ws97-l-0023)
i don't know how you do that (sw2335a-ws97-l-0024)
yeah (sw2335a-ws97-l-0025)
well [{] [{] [i-] [/] [@] [}] [/] [@] [}] i've heard this one theory that if you know a kid commits a crime that the instead of the prosecuting the kid they [prosecute] the parent (sw2335a-ws97-l-0026)
or both of them (sw2335a-ws97-l-0027)
now to put the blame on the parent (sw2335a-ws97-l-0028)
yeah (sw2335a-ws97-l-0029)
yeah (sw2335a-ws97-l-0030)
yeah (sw2335a-ws97-l-0031)
yeah (sw2335a-ws97-l-0032)
yeah (sw2335a-ws97-l-0033)
[uhhuh] (sw2335a-ws97-l-0034)
yeah (sw2335a-ws97-l-0035)
no (sw2335a-ws97-l-0037)
i didn't see it (sw2335a-ws97-l-0038)
yeah (sw2335a-ws97-l-0040)
yeah (sw2335a-ws97-l-0041)
yeah (sw2335a-ws97-l-0042)
what about with adults (sw2335a-ws97-l-0043)
do you think they can do anything about just adult regular adult crime (sw2335a-ws97-l-0044)
yeah (sw2335a-ws97-l-0045)
huh [{] [{] [f-] [/] [@] [}] [/] [@] [}] well the major problem with that is the jails are overcrowded (sw2335a-ws97-l-0046)
[uhhuh] (sw2335a-ws97-l-0047)
[%hesitation] (sw2335a-ws97-l-0048)
yeah (sw2335a-ws97-l-0049)
yeah (sw2335a-ws97-l-0050)
yeah (sw2335a-ws97-l-0051)
i mean seriously (sw2335a-ws97-l-0052)
they ought to put those good people to work (sw2335a-ws97-l-0053)
yeah (sw2335a-ws97-l-0054)
huh (sw2335a-ws97-l-0055a)
yeah (sw2335a-ws97-l-0055b)
yeah (sw2335a-ws97-l-0056)
yeah (sw2335a-ws97-l-0057)
yeah (sw2335a-ws97-l-0058)
well (sw2335a-ws97-l-0059)
[{] [{] [th-] [/] [@] [}] [/] [@] [}] yeah (sw2335a-ws97-l-0060)
they you still have to punish (sw2335a-ws97-l-0061)
yeah (sw2335a-ws97-l-0062)
yeah (sw2335a-ws97-l-0063)
yeah (sw2335a-ws97-l-0065)
and they're they're still they can provide for society (sw2335a-ws97-l-0066)
whereas some of them are so far gone that they can't do anything good for society (sw2335a-ws97-l-0067)
yeah (sw2335a-ws97-l-0068)
huh yeah that's true (sw2335a-ws97-l-0069)
no (sw2335a-ws97-l-0070)
i don't think so either (sw2335a-ws97-l-0071)
[%hesitation] (sw2335a-ws97-l-0072)
yeah (sw2335a-ws97-l-0073)
and they keep taking more money from us yeah (sw2335a-ws97-l-0074)
people aren't getting [{] [{] [t-] [/] [@] [}] [/] [@] [}] (sw2335a-ws97-l-0075)
and they don't have any incentive to work if we're just going to take fifty percent of it (sw2335a-ws97-l-0076)
might as well [{] [{] [stea-] [/] [@] [}] [/] [@] [}] (sw2335a-ws97-l-0077)
but then they don't have to pay taxes on it (sw2335a-ws97-l-0078)
so what do you think (sw2335b-ws97-l-0001)
yep (sw2335b-ws97-l-0002)
what about (sw2335b-ws97-l-0003)
i agree with the upper and lower level you know (sw2335b-ws97-l-0004)
because that's the lowest thing for themselves (sw2335b-ws97-l-0005)
plus there's nobody for them to look up to (sw2335b-ws97-l-0006)
but i also blame some of it on parents (sw2335b-ws97-l-0007)
because parents aren't parents (sw2335b-ws97-l-0008)
because i remember even when i was growing up (sw2335b-ws97-l-0009)
i'm thirty five (sw2335b-ws97-l-0010)
i remember when i was growing up (sw2335b-ws97-l-0011)
and i had friends (sw2335b-ws97-l-0012)
they used to do stuff like you know go to the store and steal stuff (sw2335b-ws97-l-0013)
my mother warned us it's like i don't care what your friends do (sw2335b-ws97-l-0014)
if you do it then that was it (sw2335b-ws97-l-0015)
i mean i knew that i would get in [{] [{] [m-] [/] [@] [}] [/] [@] [}] more trouble from my mother than from from anybody else (sw2335b-ws97-l-0016)
because i think that's the basics is they have no morals any more (sw2335b-ws97-l-0017)
so they don't care (sw2335b-ws97-l-0018)
so (sw2335b-ws97-l-0019)
but now as far as what they can do about it i don't know (sw2335b-ws97-l-0020)
you can't make parents be parents (sw2335b-ws97-l-0021)
you know (sw2335b-ws97-l-0022)
i guess if you gave the gave them jobs [{] [{] [th-] [/] [@] [}] [/] [@] [}] (sw2335b-ws97-l-0023)
that's another problem with the united states (sw2335b-ws97-l-0024)
there's no jobs any more (sw2335b-ws97-l-0025)
but (sw2335b-ws97-l-0026)
that'll work to a point (sw2335b-ws97-l-0027)
well that'd work to a point because some kids are just bad [{] [{] [anyw-] [/] [@] [}] [/] [@] [}] (sw2335b-ws97-l-0028)
well i don't care what you do to them (sw2335b-ws97-l-0029)
you know [{] [{] [i-] [/] [@] [}] [/] [@] [}] (sw2335b-ws97-l-0030)
so i think it depends on how much trouble that kid has been in you know (sw2335b-ws97-l-0031)
because a a child can get into anything thing [{] [{] [regar-] [/] [@] [}] [/] [@] [}] (sw2335b-ws97-l-0032)
i don't care [{] [{] [wh-] [/] [@] [}] [/] [@] [}] how good j are (sw2335b-ws97-l-0033)
even at least one time (sw2335b-ws97-l-0034)
but now if it's a repeated thing (sw2335b-ws97-l-0035)
here with this child in [juvenile] (sw2335b-ws97-l-0036)
and all the to me yeah both of them (sw2335b-ws97-l-0037)
because that means she's still not doing what she's supposed to do (sw2335b-ws97-l-0038)
because i just watched it on t v one night on one of them [%hesitation] twenty twenty forty eight hours one of them [st] shows where this boy had been stealing cars (sw2335b-ws97-l-0039)
i don't know if you seen (sw2335b-ws97-l-0040)
they was the guy a little it was a little gang of them stealing cars you know (sw2335b-ws97-l-0041)
and then when they caught him you know his mother is sitting there (sw2335b-ws97-l-0042)
now they going to take me away from you (sw2335b-ws97-l-0043)
that means she was warned (sw2335b-ws97-l-0044)
but see by that i think it'll sometimes it's a little late (sw2335b-ws97-l-0045)
you know (sw2335b-ws97-l-0046)
but i'm sure there's something can be done (sw2335b-ws97-l-0047)
yeah (sw2335b-ws97-l-0048)
start prosecuting they (sw2335b-ws97-l-0049)
but really good instead of having a [revolving] door on the damn court system (sw2335b-ws97-l-0050)
well they should start with the (sw2335b-ws97-l-0051)
if they would get rid of (sw2335b-ws97-l-0052)
see to me i know there's a lot about courts that people don't understand (sw2335b-ws97-l-0053)
there's more people in jail right now for child support okay then there are for people doing drugs (sw2335b-ws97-l-0054)
yeah take all them little misdemeanor people (sw2335b-ws97-l-0055)
let them go (sw2335b-ws97-l-0056)
let them go (sw2335b-ws97-l-0057)
you know give them a fine whatever (sw2335b-ws97-l-0058)
make them do civic duty whatever (sw2335b-ws97-l-0059)
put them fools in there (sw2335b-ws97-l-0060)
that's what they need to [{] [{] [pu-] [/] [@] [}] [/] [@] [}] i call i call them all fools [idiots] whatever (sw2335b-ws97-l-0061)
little rock stars put all them in there (sw2335b-ws97-l-0062)
you know the murderers the the drug dealers the user put them all in (sw2335b-ws97-l-0063)
jail you know (sw2335b-ws97-l-0064)
and let all the normal people go (sw2335b-ws97-l-0065)
you know because okay (sw2335b-ws97-l-0066)
if you write a bad check you go to jail right (sw2335b-ws97-l-0067)
okay let them people go (sw2335b-ws97-l-0068)
not let them go and get out of it (sw2335b-ws97-l-0069)
let them go and pay their crime or their time doing something else you know like cleaning up the city or however they do they community time you know whatever that is (sw2335b-ws97-l-0070)
but put don't put them in jail because they're not hardened criminals (sw2335b-ws97-l-0071)
[uhhuh] (sw2335b-ws97-l-0072)
so (sw2335b-ws97-l-0073)
i don't [{] [{] [know-] [/] [@] [}] [/] [@] [}] (sw2335b-ws97-l-0074)
them people boy they got (sw2335b-ws97-l-0075)
i think the united states has got too many problems to be worried about everybody else (sw2335b-ws97-l-0076)
now how they going to fix it i don't know (sw2335b-ws97-l-0077)
i don't think there is a ready solution (sw2335b-ws97-l-0078)
because the economy is down people you know the the the low man on the pole is getting more of the i guess the bulk of it (sw2335b-ws97-l-0079)
and he's going to have to work extra hard just to make ends meet (sw2335b-ws97-l-0080)
[uhhuh] (sw2335b-ws97-l-0081)
yeah (sw2335b-ws97-l-0082)
that's it (sw2335b-ws97-l-0083)
so you know they i i i know that's bad but you know just like texas now (sw2335b-ws97-l-0084)
well i don't know (sw2434a-ws97-l-0001)
i've i've had mixed emotions i guess when i listen to [%hesitation] the radio and and watch t v about the different [%hesitation] things that are happening (sw2434a-ws97-l-0002)
[%hesitation] i'm against it (sw2434a-ws97-l-0003)
but on the same token [%hesitation] i went out and purchased the gun just because i wanted the right to do that (sw2434a-ws97-l-0004)
so i i have a rifle in the house (sw2434a-ws97-l-0005)
[%hesitation] the ammunition is probably so old i'm afraid to use it (sw2434a-ws97-l-0006)
but [%hesitation] i bought it for target practicing and [%hesitation] and also because i wanted a weapon (sw2434a-ws97-l-0007)
[%hesitation] how do you feel about it (sw2434a-ws97-l-0008)
huh (sw2434a-ws97-l-0009)
[uhhuh] (sw2434a-ws97-l-0010)
[uhhuh] (sw2434a-ws97-l-0011)
well up [%hesitation] up in new england where i'm from [%hesitation] you had to get a permit before you could buy any [{] [{] [ammunit-] [/] [@] [}] [/] [@] [}] [{] [{] [an-] [/] [@] [}] [/] [@] [}] ammunition (sw2434a-ws97-l-0012)
and i thought that was really good (sw2434a-ws97-l-0013)
and i think if they [%hesitation] (sw2434a-ws97-l-0014)
takes two weeks for that system to process [%hesitation] your request for [%hesitation] not as a gun permit but [%hesitation] but to buy ammunition (sw2434a-ws97-l-0015)
you have to get a permit from the police station in your local area to do that (sw2434a-ws97-l-0016)
yeah [%hesitation] (sw2434a-ws97-l-0017)
i i i agree (sw2434a-ws97-l-0018)
i think you know one of the things that that that needs to happen is [%hesitation] to stop the impulse buyer from [%hesitation] buying it quickly and and [%hesitation] maybe putting a week's waiting period or something on it (sw2434a-ws97-l-0019)
but if someone's really determined to to pick up a firearm [%hesitation] you can pick it up any place (sw2434a-ws97-l-0020)
and you can get them really cheap (sw2434a-ws97-l-0021)
[uhhuh] (sw2434a-ws97-l-0022)
how long was the waiting period out there (sw2434a-ws97-l-0023)
huh (sw2434a-ws97-l-0024)
that wasn't too too bad (sw2434a-ws97-l-0025)
because if if you're going to go buy something [%hesitation] [%hesitation] of that nature i think you you're going to have some idea as to what you're going to do with [{] [{] [the-] [/] [@] [}] [/] [@] [}] (sw2434a-ws97-l-0026)
you're not going to react that quickly (sw2434a-ws97-l-0027)
in other words you [{] [{] [kn-] [/] [@] [}] [/] [@] [}] you don't have a need to go buy a gun to go shoot it the next day (sw2434a-ws97-l-0028)
yeah (sw2434a-ws97-l-0029)
i do too [%hesitation] because doesn't make any difference [%hesitation] [%hesitation] whether it's a pistol or a shotgun i suppose (sw2434a-ws97-l-0030)
they both do the same kind of job (sw2434a-ws97-l-0031)
[%hesitation] yeah (sw2434a-ws97-l-0032)
i suppose (sw2434a-ws97-l-0033)
i never got shot with either one (sw2434a-ws97-l-0034)
but i don't know [%hesitation] (sw2434a-ws97-l-0035)
i think you could recover from a pistol but not from a shotgun (sw2434a-ws97-l-0036)
yeah (sw2434a-ws97-l-0037)
[uhhuh] (sw2434a-ws97-l-0038)
oh (sw2434a-ws97-l-0039)
i've got a a manual single shot (sw2434a-ws97-l-0040)
and i guess it doesn't have any any automatic features to it (sw2434a-ws97-l-0041)
the further away i get the the [%hesitation] wider the shot gets from the target (sw2434a-ws97-l-0042)
and the closer that i get the tighter that it gets (sw2434a-ws97-l-0043)
it's got a hell of a kick to it (sw2434a-ws97-l-0044)
do you belong to a gun club or are you (sw2434a-ws97-l-0045)
[%hesitation] (sw2434a-ws97-l-0046a)
[uhhuh] (sw2434a-ws97-l-0046b)
no kidding (sw2434a-ws97-l-0047)
huh well the the [%hesitation] the clubs that we've got around here are kind of expensive (sw2434a-ws97-l-0048)
but [%hesitation] it's well worth it (sw2434a-ws97-l-0049)
you could go down and shoot up against a sand bags or targets and have [%hesitation] competition (sw2434a-ws97-l-0050)
[%hesitation] i've never really joined a club because i haven't got the time not because i haven't got the desire (sw2434a-ws97-l-0051)
[%hesitation] there's an annual membership fee [%hesitation] that's that's fairly high (sw2434a-ws97-l-0052)
[initiation] fee that you have to pay because a first time [%hesitation] [%hesitation] member (sw2434a-ws97-l-0053)
so the whole process can cost you a hundred fifty dollars just to join the club (sw2434a-ws97-l-0054)
plus you have to pay for the the ammunition and any tournaments that you would join in (sw2434a-ws97-l-0055)
[uhhuh] (sw2434a-ws97-l-0056)
i think that the gun clubs serve a useful purpose (sw2434a-ws97-l-0057)
in fact i'd like to see somehow they tie the legislation into not only when you buy a weapon you have to [%hesitation] show that you've gone to school or gone to some class to know how to handle that weapon (sw2434a-ws97-l-0058)
and you know it it (sw2434a-ws97-l-0059)
even after you wait your nine days if you don't know how to handle it this is like putting someone in an automobile that doesn't know how to drive (sw2434a-ws97-l-0060)
and you give him a license because he waited nine days (sw2434a-ws97-l-0061)
well what would you say your opinion is on gun control (sw2434b-ws97-l-0001)
well i think [%hesitation] down here in texas they don't have a waiting period on handguns (sw2434b-ws97-l-0003)
and i think they need that (sw2434b-ws97-l-0004)
[%hesitation] now i do have a i have a pistol (sw2434b-ws97-l-0005)
it's a little twenty two (sw2434b-ws97-l-0006)
and i have a twenty two or a twelve gauge shotgun (sw2434b-ws97-l-0007)
[%hesitation] you know i do like to have my guns (sw2434b-ws97-l-0008)
[%hesitation] i don't know if i'll ever use it you know and like (sw2434b-ws97-l-0009)
and like you my bullets to my little [pistol's] probably [%hesitation] about three years old (sw2434b-ws97-l-0010)
[%hesitation] my gun hasn't been shot in a year or two (sw2434b-ws97-l-0011)
but [%hesitation] i like to have them where handy (sw2434b-ws97-l-0012)
why i've never heard of anything like that (sw2434b-ws97-l-0013)
that would be nice (sw2434b-ws97-l-0014)
but [{] [{] [a-] [/] [@] [}] [/] [@] [}] you know (sw2434b-ws97-l-0015)
the criminals they are going to get their guns one way or the other (sw2434b-ws97-l-0016)
yeah (sw2434b-ws97-l-0017)
i know (sw2434b-ws97-l-0018)
i had a waiting period on my pistol because i was down in [%hesitation] tennessee and [%hesitation] they had a waiting period (sw2434b-ws97-l-0019)
and [%hesitation] we bought it there (sw2434b-ws97-l-0020)
an (sw2434b-ws97-l-0021)
about nine days (sw2434b-ws97-l-0022)
no (sw2434b-ws97-l-0023)
somebody wants to (sw2434b-ws97-l-0026)
the i at times i think they ought to have a waiting period on all firearms (sw2434b-ws97-l-0027)
a shotgun hurts worse than a pistol does (sw2434b-ws97-l-0028)
a shotgun has got too much of a spread (sw2434b-ws97-l-0030)
or at least ours does (sw2434b-ws97-l-0031)
[%hesitation] it [{] [{] [you-] [/] [@] [}] [/] [@] [}] (sw2434b-ws97-l-0032)
you have a little [%hesitation] thing on the [{] [{] [bo-] [/] [@] [}] [/] [@] [}] bottom of the on top of the barrel where you [{] [{] [a-] [/] [@] [}] [/] [@] [}] as you turn it (sw2434b-ws97-l-0033)
you can make it either tight or as loose as loose can get (sw2434b-ws97-l-0034)
and the spread changes (sw2434b-ws97-l-0035)
yeah (sw2434b-ws97-l-0036)
[{] [{] [yep-] [/] [@] [}] [/] [@] [}] (sw2434b-ws97-l-0037)
my husband had a [%hesitation] a police gun at one time (sw2434b-ws97-l-0038)
and i shot that thing one time (sw2434b-ws97-l-0039)
almost knocked me down (sw2434b-ws97-l-0040)
it just looked (sw2434b-ws97-l-0041)
well i don't i forget (sw2434b-ws97-l-0042)
i think it was a three fifty seven (sw2434b-ws97-l-0043)
i'm not sure (sw2434b-ws97-l-0044)
he belonged to one awhile back (sw2434b-ws97-l-0045)
oh since we moved (sw2434b-ws97-l-0046)
we've only been here in texas for about a year (sw2434b-ws97-l-0047)
yeah [%hesitation] we can't even find a place to shoot just for target practice (sw2434b-ws97-l-0048)
i'd love to get used to that shotgun (sw2434b-ws97-l-0049)
we traded his pistol for that shotgun (sw2434b-ws97-l-0050)
yeah (sw2434b-ws97-l-0051)
well that's what [%hesitation] my husband (sw2434b-ws97-l-0052)
when he was in it gun club where he was doing that (sw2434b-ws97-l-0053)
it you know (sw2434b-ws97-l-0054)
he went mostly just to [%hesitation] shoot at paper targets (sw2434b-ws97-l-0055)
[%hesitation] but you know they used speed and accuracy and all that (sw2434b-ws97-l-0056)
that's a good (sw2434b-ws97-l-0057)
i've never thought of that (sw2434b-ws97-l-0058)
that's a good point (sw2434b-ws97-l-0059)
well i haven't heard anything about the proposal myself (sw2441a-ws97-l-0001)
but [%hesitation] [%hesitation] i don't know if it's their proposal or one's being seriously kicked around (sw2441a-ws97-l-0002)
i've i've always felt for a long time that i i think that all young kids ought to do a [stint] [%hesitation] primarily in the military (sw2441a-ws97-l-0003)
a lot a (sw2441a-ws97-l-0005)
yeah (sw2441a-ws97-l-0006)
yeah (sw2441a-ws97-l-0008)
a lot (sw2441a-ws97-l-0009)
well you take israel (sw2441a-ws97-l-0011)
i mean everybody does (sw2441a-ws97-l-0012)
i don't think it's a bad idea (sw2441a-ws97-l-0013)
it teaches teaches a lot (sw2441a-ws97-l-0014)
i mean i went in the service when i was eighteen and [%hesitation] stayed in for ten years (sw2441a-ws97-l-0015)
yeah (sw2441a-ws97-l-0016)
did a lot of growing up (sw2441a-ws97-l-0017)
yeah (sw2441a-ws97-l-0018)
yeah (sw2441a-ws97-l-0019)
do it himself (sw2441a-ws97-l-0020)
well my parents wanted to send me to college (sw2441a-ws97-l-0021)
and i was dead set against it (sw2441a-ws97-l-0022)
you know i had wander [lust] you know (sw2441a-ws97-l-0023)
and i got in (sw2441a-ws97-l-0024)
and after after wasting the first six years [%hesitation] partying and everything else i decided [uhhuh] time to settle down and do something (sw2441a-ws97-l-0025)
so i started to work on my education (sw2441a-ws97-l-0026)
course my job was such that i didn't i couldn't do it as much as i wanted (sw2441a-ws97-l-0027)
and still i ended up going two semesters when i got out just to get my degree (sw2441a-ws97-l-0028)
but i've been in school ever since (sw2441a-ws97-l-0029)
i guess (sw2441a-ws97-l-0031)
yeah (sw2441a-ws97-l-0032)
i mean if you don't [{] [{] [lik-] [/] [@] [}] [/] [@] [}] (sw2441a-ws97-l-0033)
it sure (sw2441a-ws97-l-0034)
exactly (sw2441a-ws97-l-0035)
oh yeah (sw2441a-ws97-l-0036)
absolutely (sw2441a-ws97-l-0037b)
all these all the all this money that we're throwing away to pay people to go out and do things when we're paying all these welfare [recipients] (sw2441a-ws97-l-0038)
and if they're able bodied people i don't see any problem at all with having them go out there and and if nothing else get a group of them together and take them around to old folks places and let em cut the yards paint the houses (sw2441a-ws97-l-0039)
sure (sw2441a-ws97-l-0040)
sure (sw2441a-ws97-l-0041)
[{] [{] [so-] [/] [@] [}] [/] [@] [}] i'm (sw2441a-ws97-l-0042)
get something out of that money (sw2441a-ws97-l-0043)
yeah (sw2441a-ws97-l-0044)
[%hesitation] i i [%hesitation] (sw2441a-ws97-l-0047)
my next door neighbor when i was growing up worked for the unemployment division (sw2441a-ws97-l-0048)
and his sole job was just tracking down people who were getting benefits and able bodied (sw2441a-ws97-l-0049)
yeah (sw2441a-ws97-l-0051)
and he he had all kinds of horror stories (sw2441a-ws97-l-0052)
you know these guys go down there and get their unemployment checks (sw2441a-ws97-l-0053)
and back back in those days they also use to give you [%hesitation] booklets good for [%hesitation] clothing and gas and things like this (sw2441a-ws97-l-0054)
they get all this stuff together sit down and have [poker] games you know (sw2441a-ws97-l-0055)
and i'm i just i have a hard time dealing with that (sw2441a-ws97-l-0056)
[uhhuh] (sw2441a-ws97-l-0057)
yeah [{] [{] [no-] [/] [@] [}] [/] [@] [}] (sw2441a-ws97-l-0058)
[{]  [{] [-no] [/] [@] [}] [/] [@] [}] i know (sw2441a-ws97-l-0059)
i you you think about think about the layer of bureaucracy between the money and the [recipient] (sw2441a-ws97-l-0060)
an and there's probably there's easily probably six or seven times that amount being spent on the bureaucracy (sw2441a-ws97-l-0061)
you know it's it's it's totally ridiculous (sw2441a-ws97-l-0062)
and i i i [%hesitation] started out when i first got in graduate school (sw2441a-ws97-l-0063)
i was going into [%hesitation] public administration (sw2441a-ws97-l-0064)
and i quite honestly i just got so fed up with it i just couldn't stand it [{] [{] [any-] [/] [@] [}] [/] [@] [}] (sw2441a-ws97-l-0065)
yeah (sw2441a-ws97-l-0066)
i mean this is the kind of thing you look at (sw2441a-ws97-l-0067)
[%hesitation] you sit there (sw2441a-ws97-l-0068)
and when you're writing up budgets you wonder okay how much money do we need (sw2441a-ws97-l-0069)
well you need x number of dollars for the [recipients] (sw2441a-ws97-l-0070)
but you need x number of dollars to administer the program (sw2441a-ws97-l-0071)
well this is ridiculous (sw2441a-ws97-l-0072)
this is ridiculous (sw2441a-ws97-l-0073)
it is (sw2441a-ws97-l-0074)
it's pathetic (sw2441a-ws97-l-0075)
i mean there's got to be a different way (sw2441a-ws97-l-0076)
there's got to be a better way (sw2441a-ws97-l-0077)
but it'll never happen (sw2441a-ws97-l-0078)
i mean these these people out here getting that money are are big voting blocks (sw2441a-ws97-l-0079)
i think i think there ought to be some kind of assistance as far as [%hesitation] (sw2441a-ws97-l-0080)
and i would limit it strictly to something like to [%hesitation] tuition assistance (sw2441a-ws97-l-0081)
[%hesitation] give an incentive (sw2441a-ws97-l-0082)
yeah (sw2441a-ws97-l-0083)
some something that's going to help them along the way (sw2441a-ws97-l-0084)
sure (sw2441a-ws97-l-0085)
i mean (sw2441a-ws97-l-0086)
well this (sw2441a-ws97-l-0087)
i mean i mean you look at look at the statistics (sw2441a-ws97-l-0088)
i mean it's sad (sw2441a-ws97-l-0089)
one in five americans can't read (sw2441a-ws97-l-0090)
no (sw2441b-ws97-l-0001)
i haven't either (sw2441b-ws97-l-0002)
yeah (sw2441b-ws97-l-0003)
most countries require that now (sw2441b-ws97-l-0004)
they you know they have [%hesitation] it mandatory for for the [%hesitation] at least the young men (sw2441b-ws97-l-0005)
i don't know about the young women (sw2441b-ws97-l-0006)
if they have to serve in the military to above us (sw2441b-ws97-l-0007)
yeah (sw2441b-ws97-l-0008)
[uhhuh] (sw2441b-ws97-l-0009)
is that right (sw2441b-ws97-l-0010)
i bet (sw2441b-ws97-l-0011)
and hell you have to (sw2441b-ws97-l-0012)
and my father had been in the [{] [{] [milit-] [/] [@] [}] [/] [@] [}] (sw2441b-ws97-l-0014)
i didn't do it myself (sw2441b-ws97-l-0015)
my father had (sw2441b-ws97-l-0016)
and that's [%hesitation] how he put himself through school basically (sw2441b-ws97-l-0017)
he came from a poor immigrant family (sw2441b-ws97-l-0018)
and he didn't have a chance to [%hesitation] you know (sw2441b-ws97-l-0019)
the parent wasn't the parent wasn't wealthy (sw2441b-ws97-l-0020)
so he had to [%hesitation] do something to put himself through school (sw2441b-ws97-l-0021)
and he did he did (sw2441b-ws97-l-0022)
and he was very successful [{] [{] [at-] [/] [@] [}] [/] [@] [}] (sw2441b-ws97-l-0023)
yes (sw2441b-ws97-l-0024a)
yes (sw2441b-ws97-l-0024b)
yeah (sw2441b-ws97-l-0025)
[uhhuh] (sw2441b-ws97-l-0026)
that's pretty good (sw2441b-ws97-l-0027)
that's good (sw2441b-ws97-l-0028)
yeah (sw2441b-ws97-l-0029)
that's [%hesitation] (sw2441b-ws97-l-0030)
i don't know (sw2441b-ws97-l-0031)
there's other kinds of service for the country that could be done you know (sw2441b-ws97-l-0032)
[%hesitation] working in the national parks [%hesitation] working clean up the [roadsides] (sw2441b-ws97-l-0033)
i mean there's lots of i mean i've always felt that [%hesitation] people that go on welfare should be required to spend at least part of their time not not all the time because that that takes away from their opportunity to look for a job but at least some of their time to look for to [%hesitation] go out and clean up the roads and you know (sw2441b-ws97-l-0034)
i mean (sw2441b-ws97-l-0035)
yeah (sw2441b-ws97-l-0036)
yeah (sw2441b-ws97-l-0037)
we'd learn service to other people this country (sw2441b-ws97-l-0038)
the country would benefit (sw2441b-ws97-l-0039b)
i mean [%hesitation] (sw2441b-ws97-l-0040)
is that right (sw2441b-ws97-l-0041)
yeah (sw2441b-ws97-l-0042)
yeah (sw2441b-ws97-l-0043)
yeah what i hear one time i think it was on paul [harvey's] [%hesitation] [%hesitation] radio segment that he said that if the money that that goes into welfare each year was to be given directly to the people without all the middle people in the government bureaucracy each person would receive like forty five thousand dollars (sw2441b-ws97-l-0044)
i mean i was astounded (sw2441b-ws97-l-0045)
i don't even make that (sw2441b-ws97-l-0046)
yeah (sw2441b-ws97-l-0047)
and somebody's taking that away (sw2441b-ws97-l-0048)
yeah (sw2441b-ws97-l-0049)
no doubt (sw2441b-ws97-l-0050)
is that right (sw2441b-ws97-l-0051)
yeah (sw2441b-ws97-l-0052)
yeah (sw2441b-ws97-l-0053)
it's sad (sw2441b-ws97-l-0054)
yeah (sw2441b-ws97-l-0056)
what would happen [%hesitation] if if this country required young people to do service for the country (sw2441b-ws97-l-0057)
what what should they get in return i wonder (sw2441b-ws97-l-0058)
like [%hesitation] (sw2441b-ws97-l-0059)
yeah (sw2441b-ws97-l-0060)
educational or [vocational] training or something (sw2441b-ws97-l-0061)
and that will help the country eventually too because rather than having a bunch of [uneducated] people we can have educated people (sw2441b-ws97-l-0062)
okay (sw2461a-ws97-l-0001)
we're going to talk about the public school system what's wrong with it an or if anything is wrong with it and what we can do about it what should be done about it (sw2461a-ws97-l-0002)
yeah (sw2461a-ws97-l-0003)
yeah (sw2461a-ws97-l-0004)
it's amazing [%hesitation] (sw2461a-ws97-l-0005)
i always thought that teachers never got paid nearly enough i mean to be doing what they're doing [%hesitation] (sw2461a-ws97-l-0006)
when i was in college i i enjoyed teaching (sw2461a-ws97-l-0007)
because i did some teaching part time (sw2461a-ws97-l-0008)
and i really enjoyed that (sw2461a-ws97-l-0009)
but i wouldn't want to go teach high school or junior high (sw2461a-ws97-l-0010)
at this you know too many [{] [{] [prob-] [/] [@] [}] [/] [@] [}] (sw2461a-ws97-l-0011)
yeah (sw2461a-ws97-l-0012)
they're putting in fifty sixty hours a week (sw2461a-ws97-l-0013)
i'm sure because they've got to grade papers and get class stuff [{] [{] [read-] [/] [@] [}] [/] [@] [}] (sw2461a-ws97-l-0014)
and you know and they're being paid probably half what most people are being paid (sw2461a-ws97-l-0015)
and we're paying basketball people you know millions of dollars a year for for what (sw2461a-ws97-l-0016)
yeah (sw2461a-ws97-l-0017)
yeah (sw2461a-ws97-l-0018)
it's [%hesitation] (sw2461a-ws97-l-0019)
do you have little kids or what (sw2461a-ws97-l-0020)
yep (sw2461a-ws97-l-0022)
my wife and i have a three year old almost four and a a two year old (sw2461a-ws97-l-0023)
we're looking at the the older one going to school next year not not well not this coming fall but the year after that (sw2461a-ws97-l-0024)
yeah (sw2461a-ws97-l-0025)
he's going to be going to kindergarten (sw2461a-ws97-l-0026)
so (sw2461a-ws97-l-0027)
so you know we're we're thinking about that (sw2461a-ws97-l-0028)
what's what's that going to be like (sw2461a-ws97-l-0029)
is they going to be taught nothing (sw2461a-ws97-l-0030)
or are they going be taught some of (sw2461a-ws97-l-0031)
we're going to we're going to be involved in our child's education (sw2461a-ws97-l-0032)
we're going to be teaching him what we can at home of course cause [%hesitation] i guess we don't trust school systems which is very sad [%hesitation] (sw2461a-ws97-l-0033)
but but if it doesn't start at home it's not going to go anywhere (sw2461a-ws97-l-0034)
and we're going to try to teach him good values because you know when when they get to upper level school and they start teaching well hey if you can play football or basketball that's what's important not if you can read or write or do or understand some science you know (sw2461a-ws97-l-0035)
i mean give me a break (sw2461a-ws97-l-0036)
that's that's that's [bogus] (sw2461a-ws97-l-0037)
yeah (sw2461a-ws97-l-0038)
and dallas [%hesitation] school district just recently got an [advised] status because of their low quality schooling (sw2461a-ws97-l-0039)
i couldn't believe that (sw2461a-ws97-l-0040)
yes (sw2461a-ws97-l-0041)
yeah (sw2461a-ws97-l-0042)
we talked you talked about before about the school funding (sw2461a-ws97-l-0043)
i think there's only going to be one solution to school funding which i i don't think will be necessarily the best way (sw2461a-ws97-l-0044)
but i think what's going to have to happen is there's going to have to be tuition for grade school and junior high and high school kids (sw2461a-ws97-l-0045)
that's the only way they're going to fund it because if they start raising taxes for property and people are going to throw a fit (sw2461a-ws97-l-0046)
oh yeah (sw2461a-ws97-l-0047)
yeah (sw2461a-ws97-l-0048)
and the only thing they they would think of would be tuition you know (sw2461a-ws97-l-0049)
if it works at colleges it will work down below (sw2461a-ws97-l-0050)
and you know that's going to that's going to affect the people that are having kids in school of course which is probably the only fair thing to do (sw2461a-ws97-l-0051)
but it will be hard for those that people that have have in school because they have to pay out even more (sw2461a-ws97-l-0052)
oh yeah (sw2461a-ws97-l-0053)
that's right (sw2461a-ws97-l-0054)
and most the problems with kids in school carrying guns and and knives and everything (sw2461a-ws97-l-0055)
i mean good grief what's (sw2461a-ws97-l-0056)
i can't believe that (sw2461a-ws97-l-0057)
i mean when i was in junior high and high school that never happened (sw2461a-ws97-l-0058)
you never heard about that (sw2461a-ws97-l-0059)
and now you know what do we have now (sw2461a-ws97-l-0061)
you know got kids that arrested because he got a you know a [magnum] gun school (sw2461a-ws97-l-0062)
like good grief (sw2461a-ws97-l-0063)
i mean i i'd be afraid to be in school i mean teaching or even being a student (sw2461a-ws97-l-0064)
and think what what's it going to be like for my my youngest and my oldest son when he goes to school (sw2461a-ws97-l-0065)
well what's going to happen (sw2461a-ws97-l-0066)
i mean i i'm afraid for him to go (sw2461a-ws97-l-0067)
but on the other hand you can't hold them back (sw2461a-ws97-l-0068)
yeah (sw2461a-ws97-l-0069)
and lot tougher when it was when i was going to school (sw2461a-ws97-l-0070)
and that was (sw2461a-ws97-l-0071)
well i was i graduated high school in nineteen seventy nine (sw2461a-ws97-l-0072)
so (sw2461a-ws97-l-0073)
that was what twelve years ago i guess (sw2461a-ws97-l-0074)
so you know it's lot different now (sw2461a-ws97-l-0075)
and what's it going to be like in another twelve years when my [%hesitation] oldest son is in high school (sw2461a-ws97-l-0076)
i'm afraid to i'm afraid to even think about it (sw2461a-ws97-l-0077)
okay (sw2461b-ws97-l-0001)
fantastic (sw2461b-ws97-l-0002)
one thing that pops into my mind real quick is [%hesitation] about the [%hesitation] funding of the the school system right now (sw2461b-ws97-l-0003)
evidently [%hesitation] that's that's a big problem (sw2461b-ws97-l-0004)
right (sw2461b-ws97-l-0005)
oh lord i mean yeah (sw2461b-ws97-l-0006)
and you talk about stress and pressure (sw2461b-ws97-l-0007)
i tell you what (sw2461b-ws97-l-0008)
it's [%hesitation] (sw2461b-ws97-l-0009)
right (sw2461b-ws97-l-0011)
exactly (sw2461b-ws97-l-0012)
that's right (sw2461b-ws97-l-0014)
and then they [%hesitation] [poof] it off you know do like tarpley (sw2461b-ws97-l-0015)
but [%hesitation] i don't know how you (sw2461b-ws97-l-0016)
what gets me is i can't believe that congress [%hesitation] or our state legislature can't come up with [%hesitation] some kind of workable means to have funds for the schools (sw2461b-ws97-l-0017)
you know it's [%hesitation] (sw2461b-ws97-l-0018)
i just don't understand that (sw2461b-ws97-l-0019)
no [%hesitation] (sw2461b-ws97-l-0020)
sure don't (sw2461b-ws97-l-0021)
my wife and i've just been married about two years (sw2461b-ws97-l-0022)
but i have a sister that's a [%hesitation] school teacher (sw2461b-ws97-l-0023)
and [%hesitation] (sw2461b-ws97-l-0024)
okay (sw2461b-ws97-l-0025)
okay (sw2461b-ws97-l-0026)
so it's getting close (sw2461b-ws97-l-0027)
right (sw2461b-ws97-l-0028)
right (sw2461b-ws97-l-0029)
exactly (sw2461b-ws97-l-0030)
right (sw2461b-ws97-l-0031)
that's true (sw2461b-ws97-l-0032)
exactly (sw2461b-ws97-l-0033)
right (sw2461b-ws97-l-0034)
right (sw2461b-ws97-l-0035)
[{] [{] [w-] [/] [@] [}] [/] [@] [}] and [%hesitation] you know one thing my wife and i've talked about are [%hesitation] private schools you know whether [%hesitation] [%hesitation] we would want to invest in in private schools as growing up cause you know just in the dallas area [%hesitation] we're not real comfortable with the with the public schools (sw2461b-ws97-l-0036)
right (sw2461b-ws97-l-0037)
right (sw2461b-ws97-l-0038)
you know what that's one reason we bought a house here in plano (sw2461b-ws97-l-0039)
we were hoping you know well the school districts going to be good you know for resale value and so on so forth (sw2461b-ws97-l-0040)
but [%hesitation] i can definitely [%hesitation] see on down the road you know where we do have kids and are getting to that age that's going to be a definite concern (sw2461b-ws97-l-0041)
that's (sw2461b-ws97-l-0042)
yeah (sw2461b-ws97-l-0043)
and you know that's (sw2461b-ws97-l-0044)
taxes right now are political suicide you know (sw2461b-ws97-l-0045)
and i don't think any [politician's] going to do that (sw2461b-ws97-l-0046)
so (sw2461b-ws97-l-0047)
right (sw2461b-ws97-l-0048)
exactly (sw2461b-ws97-l-0049)
and you know it's going to really hurt the the middle class [%hesitation] people i think because [%hesitation] they're the ones that'll probably have to [%hesitation] carry the [brunt] of the load (sw2461b-ws97-l-0050)
so [%hesitation] (sw2461b-ws97-l-0051)
now that's that's just unbelievable to me you know (sw2461b-ws97-l-0053)
well yeah (sw2461b-ws97-l-0054)
[%hesitation] we didn't we didn't even think about it you know (sw2461b-ws97-l-0055)
right (sw2461b-ws97-l-0056)
exactly (sw2461b-ws97-l-0057)
right (sw2461b-ws97-l-0058)
oh no and (sw2461b-ws97-l-0059)
and you want to encourage them you know to to be active and everything in school (sw2461b-ws97-l-0060)
but [%hesitation] you know with all the peer pressure that's going on with all the negative things it is [%hesitation] it's a tough environment to be growing up in (sw2461b-ws97-l-0061)
okay (sw2461b-ws97-l-0062)
right (sw2461b-ws97-l-0063)
that's right (sw2461b-ws97-l-0064)
that's right (sw2461b-ws97-l-0065)
that yeah that is a scary thought (sw2461b-ws97-l-0066)
hi [wanet] (sw2503a-ws97-l-0001)
how are you (sw2503a-ws97-l-0002)
i'm from new england (sw2503a-ws97-l-0003)
massachusetts (sw2503a-ws97-l-0004)
wow (sw2503a-ws97-l-0005)
this is quite a quite a long distance (sw2503a-ws97-l-0006)
do you have any pets (sw2503a-ws97-l-0007)
how come [%hesitation] you don't have any now (sw2503a-ws97-l-0008)
you get tired of them (sw2503a-ws97-l-0009)
yeah (sw2503a-ws97-l-0010)
i've got a little [doggy] [%hesitation] that i've had quite [%hesitation] quite a long time (sw2503a-ws97-l-0011)
in fact she just turned sixteen years old new year's eve (sw2503a-ws97-l-0012)
and [%hesitation] (sw2503a-ws97-l-0013)
i beg your pardon (sw2503a-ws97-l-0014)
she's [%hesitation] [%hesitation] [%hesitation] a poodle (sw2503a-ws97-l-0015)
[%hesitation] a toy [{] [{] [pood-] [/] [@] [}] [/] [@] [}] a toy poodle (sw2503a-ws97-l-0016)
and she's (sw2503a-ws97-l-0017)
this is little bigger than a [teacup] (sw2503a-ws97-l-0018)
and [%hesitation] it's funny how [%hesitation] how i i [%hesitation] [%hesitation] acquired this animal (sw2503a-ws97-l-0019)
[%hesitation] when i was [%hesitation] married my [%hesitation] ex wife had said that she had a friend who had a little puppy that she [{] [{] [need-] [/] [@] [}] [/] [@] [}] (sw2503a-ws97-l-0020)
[%hesitation] the woman needed someone to baby sit (sw2503a-ws97-l-0021)
and [%hesitation] this is what she had told the kids (sw2503a-ws97-l-0022)
and she even told me that (sw2503a-ws97-l-0023)
and after the two week period was up [%hesitation] she then informed me that the woman no longer wanted the little puppy and wanted to know if we wanted to keep it (sw2503a-ws97-l-0024)
well after you had an animal for a couple of weeks it's [%hesitation] you become a you become attached to it (sw2503a-ws97-l-0025)
so i've had this dog now for for sixteen years (sw2503a-ws97-l-0026)
and she's been a lot of company (sw2503a-ws97-l-0027)
[%hesitation] she's [%hesitation] however getting a little old (sw2503a-ws97-l-0028)
and things are starting to fail (sw2503a-ws97-l-0029)
[%hesitation] i i live alone now (sw2503a-ws97-l-0030)
and she stays in the house all day while i go to work (sw2503a-ws97-l-0031)
and [%hesitation] she's been holding herself pretty well the [%hesitation] up until you know recently where she's been having accidents in the house because she either is losing control or she forgets where she is (sw2503a-ws97-l-0032)
and [%hesitation] i find a little present on the floor sometimes when i come home (sw2503a-ws97-l-0033)
but she's she's usually pretty good (sw2503a-ws97-l-0034)
[uhhuh] (sw2503a-ws97-l-0035)
[uhhuh] (sw2503a-ws97-l-0036)
[%hesitation] well you might want to get yourself [%hesitation] an animal that doesn't require much attention like a cat (sw2503a-ws97-l-0037)
yeah (sw2503a-ws97-l-0038)
well my my personal preference is is a dog (sw2503a-ws97-l-0039)
[%hesitation] i don't know that [%hesitation] that i'd ever want a cat (sw2503a-ws97-l-0040)
oh i like cats (sw2503a-ws97-l-0041)
i just wouldn't want to own one (sw2503a-ws97-l-0042)
[%hesitation] they're not [%hesitation] [{] [{] [th-] [/] [@] [}] [/] [@] [}] they're affectionate (sw2503a-ws97-l-0043)
but they (sw2503a-ws97-l-0044)
i don't know (sw2503a-ws97-l-0046)
i can't seem to communicate with a cat like i can with my dog (sw2503a-ws97-l-0047)
yeah (sw2503a-ws97-l-0048)
right (sw2503a-ws97-l-0049)
that (sw2503a-ws97-l-0052)
you're supposed to appreciate that (sw2503a-ws97-l-0054)
well my my dog when i came home [%hesitation] when i come home in the evenings my dog [{] [{] [sh-] [/] [@] [}] [/] [@] [}] [greets] me at the door (sw2503a-ws97-l-0055)
i don't know that a cat would do that [%hesitation] (sw2503a-ws97-l-0056)
yeah (sw2503a-ws97-l-0057)
yeah (sw2503a-ws97-l-0058)
yeah (sw2503a-ws97-l-0059)
huh i i think [%hesitation] you know we're able to read each other pretty well because [%hesitation] she knows when i'm upset and i know when she's not feeling good too (sw2503a-ws97-l-0060)
i know like when she has an accident i know she's not doing it on purpose (sw2503a-ws97-l-0062)
when [{] [{] [sh-] [/] [@] [}] [/] [@] [}] when she was younger she used to do that to get even with me (sw2503a-ws97-l-0063)
[%hesitation] and and you know some people might not believe that (sw2503a-ws97-l-0064)
but [{] [{] [th-] [/] [@] [}] [/] [@] [}] but i do (sw2503a-ws97-l-0065)
like if i if i put her in a room all by herself and close the door and leave her there for a few hours [%hesitation] because i was going out she would [%hesitation] break something or rip up the carpet or do something just to [%hesitation] to to let me know that she was unhappy with what i did (sw2503a-ws97-l-0066)
yeah (sw2503a-ws97-l-0067)
[uhhuh] (sw2503a-ws97-l-0068)
i'm doing fine (sw2503b-ws97-l-0001)
where you from (sw2503b-ws97-l-0002)
okay (sw2503b-ws97-l-0003)
i'm from berkeley california (sw2503b-ws97-l-0004)
yeah (sw2503b-ws97-l-0005)
certainly is (sw2503b-ws97-l-0006)
no (sw2503b-ws97-l-0007)
used to (sw2503b-ws97-l-0008)
used to (sw2503b-ws97-l-0009)
but none none right now (sw2503b-ws97-l-0010)
well i i live in an apartment building (sw2503b-ws97-l-0011)
and and [%hesitation] and and it it's just not feasible you [{] [{] [kno-] [/] [@] [}] [/] [@] [}] (sw2503b-ws97-l-0012)
i'd love to have a dog you know (sw2503b-ws97-l-0013)
[%hesitation] (sw2503b-ws97-l-0014)
is she (sw2503b-ws97-l-0015)
what is she (sw2503b-ws97-l-0016)
[%hesitation] (sw2503b-ws97-l-0017)
[%hesitation] (sw2503b-ws97-l-0018)
my got my mom a [teacup] little mutt not too long ago (sw2503b-ws97-l-0019)
yeah (sw2503b-ws97-l-0020)
oh for sure (sw2503b-ws97-l-0021)
oh yeah (sw2503b-ws97-l-0022)
yes (sw2503b-ws97-l-0023)
well my my mother has one that's [%hesitation] (sw2503b-ws97-l-0024)
it's [%hesitation] [teacup] (sw2503b-ws97-l-0025)
and [%hesitation] it's made such a difference for her (sw2503b-ws97-l-0026)
but you know just i i i you know (sw2503b-ws97-l-0027)
the way my mom's presence [countenance] is just just for having a puppy (sw2503b-ws97-l-0028)
but you know having this dog (sw2503b-ws97-l-0029)
she's had it for i guess three years now oh possibly four (sw2503b-ws97-l-0030)
but [%hesitation] it was it it's it's really made such a difference for her (sw2503b-ws97-l-0031)
i really would like to (sw2503b-ws97-l-0032)
i'm a disabled person (sw2503b-ws97-l-0033)
so i'm unable to to really take care of a pet (sw2503b-ws97-l-0034)
and if that weren't so i would certainly have one (sw2503b-ws97-l-0035)
i just i just (sw2503b-ws97-l-0036)
it frustrates me sometimes not being able to have a dog (sw2503b-ws97-l-0037)
yeah (sw2503b-ws97-l-0038)
oh yeah (sw2503b-ws97-l-0039)
well yeah (sw2503b-ws97-l-0040)
[%hesitation] i i i typically am not a cat person (sw2503b-ws97-l-0041)
have a friend that [%hesitation] has on occasion [%hesitation] brought her cat over for me to keep for you know time to time (sw2503b-ws97-l-0042)
and this cat is like no other cat i have ever seen (sw2503b-ws97-l-0043)
and [%hesitation] [%hesitation] would sleep on my chest you know (sw2503b-ws97-l-0044)
it's just it's just a great cat (sw2503b-ws97-l-0045)
but (sw2503b-ws97-l-0046)
well you don't own cat (sw2503b-ws97-l-0047)
yeah (sw2503b-ws97-l-0048)
they they own you (sw2503b-ws97-l-0049a)
or or you know grant you with their presence you know (sw2503b-ws97-l-0049b)
yeah (sw2503b-ws97-l-0050)
i used to have a that could read me better than any human being in my life (sw2503b-ws97-l-0051)
i could just walk in the door (sw2503b-ws97-l-0052)
and she knew whether to to to quietly come up to me or to just run and knock me (sw2503b-ws97-l-0053)
[{] [{] [ove-] [/] [@] [}] [/] [@] [}] i mean she really could pick up on my mood [%hesitation] [%hesitation] the way i walked in the door (sw2503b-ws97-l-0054)
it was [uncanny] (sw2503b-ws97-l-0055)
yeah (sw2503b-ws97-l-0056)
yeah (sw2503b-ws97-l-0057)
[{] [{] [oh-] [/] [@] [}] [/] [@] [}] sure (sw2503b-ws97-l-0058a)
[{] [{] [oh-] [/] [@] [}] [/] [@] [}] sure (sw2503b-ws97-l-0058b)
oh absolutely (sw2503b-ws97-l-0059)
really (sw2503b-ws97-l-0060)
yes (sw2503b-ws97-l-0061)
well i had [%hesitation] that [%hesitation] cat that i mentioned [alfie] (sw2503b-ws97-l-0062)
one morning and you know the first thing you do is you get up and you yeah you you you feed this cat supper something and and you make sure that it can get to its litter box (sw2503b-ws97-l-0063)
well some reason during the night the the door was not quite wide enough for it to get through (sw2503b-ws97-l-0064)
and [%hesitation] the next morning [%hesitation] when my roommate got up and (sw2503b-ws97-l-0065)
[%hesitation] (sw2632a-ws97-l-0001)
one thing you know that i always think about when i think of public education (sw2632a-ws97-l-0002)
because i went through the public [%hesitation] school system of boston (sw2632a-ws97-l-0003)
and [%hesitation] i always felt that i graduated high school (sw2632a-ws97-l-0004)
and i still didn't even i i i couldn't put together a map of the united states (sw2632a-ws97-l-0005)
you know what i mean (sw2632a-ws97-l-0006)
and yet i felt that i got a good education (sw2632a-ws97-l-0007)
and [{] [{] [an-] [/] [@] [}] [/] [@] [}] i did well in school (sw2632a-ws97-l-0008)
but you tell me to name you know five [continents] (sw2632a-ws97-l-0009)
and i couldn't do it (sw2632a-ws97-l-0010)
i just feel like there are some real basics that are missing from education (sw2632a-ws97-l-0011)
and that people are are leaving school not even knowing some common sense things (sw2632a-ws97-l-0012)
[uhhuh] (sw2632a-ws97-l-0013)
yeah (sw2632a-ws97-l-0014)
[uhhuh] (sw2632a-ws97-l-0015)
right (sw2632a-ws97-l-0016)
yeah (sw2632a-ws97-l-0017)
[%hesitation] did you do through a a public school system or a private (sw2632a-ws97-l-0018)
[uhhuh] (sw2632a-ws97-l-0019)
did you notice a big difference (sw2632a-ws97-l-0020)
like in what sense (sw2632a-ws97-l-0021)
[uhhuh] (sw2632a-ws97-l-0022)
[uhhuh] (sw2632a-ws97-l-0023)
yeah (sw2632a-ws97-l-0024)
i work in a temporary agency (sw2632a-ws97-l-0025)
and there're people that come in you know every day to fill out an application (sw2632a-ws97-l-0026)
and they'll have to bring somebody with them (sw2632a-ws97-l-0027)
and they will show that they completed [%hesitation] four years of high school (sw2632a-ws97-l-0028)
yet when it comes to even answering the questions on a simple application they can't read enough to be able to fill out the answers by themselves (sw2632a-ws97-l-0029)
it's just incredible (sw2632a-ws97-l-0030)
really (sw2632a-ws97-l-0031)
yeah (sw2632a-ws97-l-0032)
i know (sw2632a-ws97-l-0033)
[%hesitation] they [%hesitation] (sw2632a-ws97-l-0034)
i forget (sw2632a-ws97-l-0035)
i think it's [%hesitation] some place in new york because they're having budget problems they're closing the [libraries] (sw2632a-ws97-l-0036)
i mean they're not getting rid of any of the sports or anything like that (sw2632a-ws97-l-0037)
they're not cutting in any other corners (sw2632a-ws97-l-0038)
they're closing the [libraries] (sw2632a-ws97-l-0039)
that to me shows a little [%hesitation] switch in priorities (sw2632a-ws97-l-0040)
you know (sw2632a-ws97-l-0041)
so do you go to college right now (sw2632a-ws97-l-0042)
are you (sw2632a-ws97-l-0043)
you're so you're a senior now (sw2632a-ws97-l-0044)
oh good for you (sw2632a-ws97-l-0045)
that's great (sw2632a-ws97-l-0046)
[%hesitation] is is n c university is that [%hesitation] [%hesitation] (sw2632a-ws97-l-0047)
what did you say (sw2632a-ws97-l-0048)
n c state (sw2632a-ws97-l-0049)
that's a state university then (sw2632a-ws97-l-0050)
i see (sw2632a-ws97-l-0051)
and you're from there also (sw2632a-ws97-l-0052)
[uhhuh] (sw2632a-ws97-l-0053)
i see (sw2632a-ws97-l-0054)
well pretty soon it's going to get to the point where no one is going to be able to afford to send their kids to college or to go to college (sw2632a-ws97-l-0055)
it's just outrageously expensive (sw2632a-ws97-l-0056)
oh is it (sw2632a-ws97-l-0057)
well still though (sw2632a-ws97-l-0058)
i mean you know thousands of dollars (sw2632a-ws97-l-0059)
in oh well that's good (sw2632a-ws97-l-0060)
that's good (sw2632a-ws97-l-0061)
i went to private university (sw2632a-ws97-l-0062)
and [%hesitation] [%hesitation] i don't know (sw2632a-ws97-l-0063)
i look back now (sw2632a-ws97-l-0064)
and i i think that i probably would have done it differently if i [%hesitation] you know could do it over again (sw2632a-ws97-l-0065)
but [%hesitation] i have a lot of friends that went to state schools or didn't even go to school some some of them (sw2632a-ws97-l-0066)
and i still feel like they came out knowing just as much as i did (sw2632a-ws97-l-0067)
i really [{] [{] [d-] [/] [@] [}] [/] [@] [}] (sw2632a-ws97-l-0068)
and that's probably a pretty sad thing to say (sw2632a-ws97-l-0069)
but [%hesitation] (sw2632a-ws97-l-0070)
i don't know (sw2632a-ws97-l-0071)
i (sw2632a-ws97-l-0072)
what (sw2632a-ws97-l-0073)
i went to [brandeis] university (sw2632a-ws97-l-0074)
it's in massachusetts (sw2632a-ws97-l-0075)
and [%hesitation] i i really felt like i've been working now for about four years (sw2632a-ws97-l-0076)
and i i feel like what i've learned working is a hundred times more valuable then what learned in school (sw2632a-ws97-l-0077)
and i know that i'm drawing a lot on what i learned in school you know (sw2632a-ws97-l-0078)
i i probably just [subconsciously] rely a lot on on art (sw2632a-ws97-l-0079)
but [%hesitation] i don't know (sw2632a-ws97-l-0080)
my sister's a principal at a school (sw2632a-ws97-l-0081)
and one thing that she's trying to instill in kids (sw2632a-ws97-l-0082)
alright (sw2632b-ws97-l-0001)
[uhhuh] (sw2632b-ws97-l-0002)
huh (sw2632b-ws97-l-0003)
[uhhuh] (sw2632b-ws97-l-0004)
[uhhuh] (sw2632b-ws97-l-0005)
huh (sw2632b-ws97-l-0006)
yeah (sw2632b-ws97-l-0007)
one (sw2632b-ws97-l-0008)
[{] [{] [a-] [/] [@] [}] [/] [@] [}] well talking about public education [%hesitation] i was [{] [{] [j-] [/] [@] [}] [/] [@] [}] i'm we're doing a proposal (sw2632b-ws97-l-0009)
we're doing at n c state (sw2632b-ws97-l-0010)
we're trying to improve the computer science curriculum (sw2632b-ws97-l-0011)
so that's kind of at a higher level (sw2632b-ws97-l-0012)
so it's interesting that you chose that topic (sw2632b-ws97-l-0013)
yeah (sw2632b-ws97-l-0014)
well i went through private until ninth grade (sw2632b-ws97-l-0015)
yeah (sw2632b-ws97-l-0016a)
oh yeah (sw2632b-ws97-l-0016b)
a big difference (sw2632b-ws97-l-0017)
well [%hesitation] in [%hesitation] public schools i guess there are there are a lot of you know (sw2632b-ws97-l-0018)
people can take lower level courses and get away with learning nothing (sw2632b-ws97-l-0019)
but [%hesitation] in private school you couldn't do that (sw2632b-ws97-l-0020)
you know you had to learn (sw2632b-ws97-l-0021)
[uhhuh] (sw2632b-ws97-l-0022)
huh (sw2632b-ws97-l-0024a)
bad (sw2632b-ws97-l-0024b)
yep (sw2632b-ws97-l-0025)
our state just cut a whole bunch of [%hesitation] like think it's ten million dollars out of the school budget (sw2632b-ws97-l-0026)

i was [%hesitation] i was born in (sw2632b-ws97-l-0043)
raleigh then i lived in [winston] salem most of my life (sw2632b-ws97-l-0044)
so now i'm back here going to school (sw2632b-ws97-l-0045)
yeah (sw2632b-ws97-l-0046)
luckily state's the [{] [{] [ch-] [/] [@] [}] [/] [@] [}] one of the cheap ones (sw2632b-ws97-l-0047)
yeah state's not that bad (sw2632b-ws97-l-0049)
yeah (sw2632b-ws97-l-0050)
yeah (sw2632b-ws97-l-0051)
[uhhuh] (sw2632b-ws97-l-0053a)
yeah (sw2632b-ws97-l-0053b)
where'd you go (sw2632b-ws97-l-0054)
where did you go (sw2632b-ws97-l-0055)
[%hesitation] (sw2724a-ws97-l-0001)
i [%hesitation] weight train [%hesitation] three days on and one day off (sw2724a-ws97-l-0002)
i [%hesitation] ride bicycles [%hesitation] fifteen twenty miles i don't know maybe three times maybe four times a week (sw2724a-ws97-l-0003)
i play basketball [%hesitation] a couple times a week (sw2724a-ws97-l-0004)
[{]  [{] [-i] [/] [@] [}] [/] [@] [}] play softball one night a week (sw2724a-ws97-l-0005)
[%hesitation] that's what i do (sw2724a-ws97-l-0006)
what about yourself (sw2724a-ws97-l-0007)
[uhhuh] (sw2724a-ws97-l-0008)
oh really (sw2724a-ws97-l-0009)
yeah (sw2724a-ws97-l-0010)
[{] [{] [w-] [/] [@] [}] [/] [@] [}] [%hesitation] would you ride [%hesitation] like a bunch of hills or pretty flat (sw2724a-ws97-l-0011)
how long does that take you to get to work (sw2724a-ws97-l-0012)
how [{] [{] [d-] [/] [@] [}] [/] [@] [}] how does that work work out with [%hesitation] storing your bike and [showering] and all that (sw2724a-ws97-l-0013)
[uhhuh] (sw2724a-ws97-l-0014)
right (sw2724a-ws97-l-0015)
yeah (sw2724a-ws97-l-0016)
do you ride a lot of rallies are a lot of those around there (sw2724a-ws97-l-0017)
[uhhuh] (sw2724a-ws97-l-0018)
[%hesitation] well actually my wife just got me into it (sw2724a-ws97-l-0019)
and i did a did an internship at the institute for aerobics research in dallas the cooper clinic (sw2724a-ws97-l-0020)
and i learned all the health benefits of [{] [{] [i-] [/] [@] [}] [/] [@] [}] you know (sw2724a-ws97-l-0021)
i was a solid weight trainer (sw2724a-ws97-l-0022)
and all i did was weights and [anaerobic] exercise (sw2724a-ws97-l-0023)
and then my wife got me into the aerobic exercise said you really need to do it (sw2724a-ws97-l-0024)
so once i got into this [%hesitation] internship i learned all the [physiological] [{] [{] [a-] [/] [@] [}] [/] [@] [}] [{] [{] [advan-] [/] [@] [}] [/] [@] [}] advantages to it (sw2724a-ws97-l-0025)
so i began a program couple i don't know probably three or four weeks ago (sw2724a-ws97-l-0026)
and i did my first bike rally this saturday (sw2724a-ws97-l-0027)
i did [%hesitation] forty forty miles (sw2724a-ws97-l-0028)
and [%hesitation] that's the longest i'd ever ridden so far (sw2724a-ws97-l-0029)
i usually you know fifteen or twenty (sw2724a-ws97-l-0030)
and [{] [{] [i-] [/] [@] [}] [/] [@] [}] it was kind of hilly (sw2724a-ws97-l-0031)
and it was pretty tough (sw2724a-ws97-l-0032)
but [%hesitation] i'm looking at [%hesitation] doing a lot more of it because you know my wife is really into it (sw2724a-ws97-l-0033)
and i i kind of held her back a little bit this this weekend (sw2724a-ws97-l-0034)
she wanted to go go go (sw2724a-ws97-l-0035)
but you know she wanted to stay with me (sw2724a-ws97-l-0036)
yeah (sw2724a-ws97-l-0037)
it really is (sw2724a-ws97-l-0038)
yeah (sw2724a-ws97-l-0039)
that'd be cool sometime if i could you know work up to that (sw2724a-ws97-l-0040)
oh (sw2724a-ws97-l-0041)
i've never really looked into that (sw2724a-ws97-l-0042)
that you know that's (sw2724a-ws97-l-0043)
my wife would just love that (sw2724a-ws97-l-0044)
and i may do that sometime (sw2724a-ws97-l-0045)
there again i'm just kind of a [fledgling] into this (sw2724a-ws97-l-0046)
i've it's kind of funny (sw2724a-ws97-l-0047)
i called this number (sw2724a-ws97-l-0048)
[{]  [{] [-a] [/] [@] [}] [/] [@] [}] i was just reading through a a bicycle magazine and going through all the different tours coming up (sw2724a-ws97-l-0049)
i mean around texas [{] [{] [you-] [/] [@] [}] [/] [@] [}] you got about five or six (sw2724a-ws97-l-0050)
if you live around the dallas area you got five or six every weekend to choose from because they're really into it (sw2724a-ws97-l-0051)
bicycling is really big here (sw2724a-ws97-l-0052)
i didn't know that and you know until i came down here and she kind of caught the fever (sw2724a-ws97-l-0053)
because i lived in indiana all my life (sw2724a-ws97-l-0054)
and you know you may say see one or two guys on a bicycle that are above the age of fifteen or something (sw2724a-ws97-l-0055)
but other than that it's nothing up there like it is down here (sw2724a-ws97-l-0056)
probably (sw2724a-ws97-l-0057)
[%hesitation] so what do you do to exercise (sw2724b-ws97-l-0001)
[uhhuh] (sw2724b-ws97-l-0002)
huh (sw2724b-ws97-l-0003a)
huh (sw2724b-ws97-l-0003b)
that's pretty impressive (sw2724b-ws97-l-0004)
[%hesitation] i guess i bicycle (sw2724b-ws97-l-0005)
[%hesitation] the amount varies (sw2724b-ws97-l-0006)
as much as a hundred and fifty miles a week (sw2724b-ws97-l-0007)
[%hesitation] i guess a play softball one night a week (sw2724b-ws97-l-0008)
and i backpack a lot over the summer (sw2724b-ws97-l-0009)
yeah (sw2724b-ws97-l-0010)
that's that's about the extent of it (sw2724b-ws97-l-0011)
i mean i don't do any of those things particularly you know for exercise (sw2724b-ws97-l-0012)
but [%hesitation] i guess the bicycling is the one thing i'll sort of like do if i feel like i need to go exercise (sw2724b-ws97-l-0013)
[%hesitation] but i do it mostly for fun (sw2724b-ws97-l-0014)
it it it varies (sw2724b-ws97-l-0015)
[%hesitation] out near my house it's pretty hilly (sw2724b-ws97-l-0016)
[%hesitation] but sometimes i bike to work which is about [%hesitation] a fifteen mile trip each way (sw2724b-ws97-l-0017)
and that's mostly flat (sw2724b-ws97-l-0018)
[%hesitation] about forty five fifty minutes (sw2724b-ws97-l-0019)
yeah (sw2724b-ws97-l-0020)
it can be a pain (sw2724b-ws97-l-0021)
[%hesitation] basically [%hesitation] i work on a campus (sw2724b-ws97-l-0022)
so i can store my bike in my office and walk across the [%hesitation] campus to the [%hesitation] gym use the shower there (sw2724b-ws97-l-0023)
[%hesitation] but it's it's enough of a pain that i did it consistently one year (sw2724b-ws97-l-0024)
i would commute every day [%hesitation] (sw2724b-ws97-l-0025)
but it just became such a pain (sw2724b-ws97-l-0026)
i mean we were talking you know forty five fifty minutes for biking [%hesitation] and sometimes longer if you had [adverse] wind and then another half an hour you know to cool down and take a shower and all this kind of stuff (sw2724b-ws97-l-0027)
it was a big [hunk] [hunk] of the day (sw2724b-ws97-l-0028)
[%hesitation] and then of course another hour to get back home (sw2724b-ws97-l-0029)
[%hesitation] so i've been doing that less and and concentrating more on you know light biking when i get home on the evening and then you know some more on the weekends (sw2724b-ws97-l-0030)
not so much (sw2724b-ws97-l-0031)
[%hesitation] i guess mostly i bike on my own (sw2724b-ws97-l-0032)
i've got a [touring] bike [%hesitation] though i haven't gone on any extended trips with it (sw2724b-ws97-l-0033)
how about you (sw2724b-ws97-l-0034)
what kind of biking do you do (sw2724b-ws97-l-0035)
[uhhuh] (sw2724b-ws97-l-0036)
[uhhuh] (sw2724b-ws97-l-0037)
[uhhuh] (sw2724b-ws97-l-0038)
huh (sw2724b-ws97-l-0039)
[uhhuh] (sw2724b-ws97-l-0040)
oh i see (sw2724b-ws97-l-0041)
[uhhuh] (sw2724b-ws97-l-0042)
it's good to have a partner (sw2724b-ws97-l-0043)
so you you think of doing any like centuries or (sw2724b-ws97-l-0044)
[uhhuh] (sw2724b-ws97-l-0045)
i just wondered if you were going to do that mostly or more like you know [%hesitation] [%hesitation] [touring] like from vermont or you know that kind of thing (sw2724b-ws97-l-0047)
i mean people seem to get into different aspects (sw2724b-ws97-l-0048)
one is more of a distance (sw2724b-ws97-l-0049)
and one's more just you know (sw2724b-ws97-l-0050)
they want to put some equipment on their bike and go for a tour (sw2724b-ws97-l-0051)
[uhhuh] (sw2724b-ws97-l-0052)
[uhhuh] (sw2724b-ws97-l-0053)
yeah (sw2724b-ws97-l-0054)
yeah (sw2724b-ws97-l-0055)
oh that's nice (sw2724b-ws97-l-0056)
huh (sw2724b-ws97-l-0057)
wow (sw2724b-ws97-l-0058)
yeah (sw2724b-ws97-l-0059)
[uhhuh] (sw2724b-ws97-l-0060)
yeah (sw2724b-ws97-l-0061)
i'm not sure why that is (sw2724b-ws97-l-0062)
i mean generally in the midwest it seems to be less much less (sw2724b-ws97-l-0063)
i mean maybe it's because of the winters [%hesitation] or maybe just because you know there's there's a lot more flat lands you know out in the west (sw2724b-ws97-l-0064)
how bad is it (sw2752a-ws97-l-0001)
do you have smog like they do in california (sw2752a-ws97-l-0002)
[uhhuh] (sw2752a-ws97-l-0003)
depends on whether you have some sort of temperature inversion i take (sw2752a-ws97-l-0004)
yeah (sw2752a-ws97-l-0005)
[uhhuh] (sw2752a-ws97-l-0006)
[uhhuh] (sw2752a-ws97-l-0007)
what do you think is your primary cause of it (sw2752a-ws97-l-0008)
you do (sw2752a-ws97-l-0009)
you really think cars contribute a lot now that they've taken lead out of gas (sw2752a-ws97-l-0010)
[uhhuh] (sw2752a-ws97-l-0011)
[%hesitation] (sw2752a-ws97-l-0012)
my goodness (sw2752a-ws97-l-0013)
[uhhuh] (sw2752a-ws97-l-0014)
i think a lot of it's industrial (sw2752a-ws97-l-0015)
i also think [%hesitation] that [%hesitation] there is a certain amount that comes from automobiles (sw2752a-ws97-l-0016)
but it's mostly from older automobiles (sw2752a-ws97-l-0017)
i don't think the newer automobiles are as polluting [%hesitation] frankly (sw2752a-ws97-l-0018)
i think that [%hesitation] i think that [%hesitation] [%hesitation] (sw2752a-ws97-l-0019)
if [%hesitation] (sw2752a-ws97-l-0020)
i i i heard a story a while back (sw2752a-ws97-l-0021)
something to the effect that if they could just pay to get twenty percent or take all the cars off of the road that have been [%hesitation] manufactured say before nineteen seventy five that they could cut the automobile pollution by over fifty percent just by getting rid of those cars that are still left remain (sw2752a-ws97-l-0022)
yeah (sw2752a-ws97-l-0023)
from from cars (sw2752a-ws97-l-0024)
that is not not total but just from cars (sw2752a-ws97-l-0025)
okay (sw2752a-ws97-l-0026)
so that i think would be a tremendous help (sw2752a-ws97-l-0027)
but i happen to drive an old model car because it's very economical (sw2752a-ws97-l-0028)
and it just keeps getting [%hesitation] gives me good service (sw2752a-ws97-l-0029)
and i don't have an incentive to get rid of it as long as it keeps running good and not costing me any money (sw2752a-ws97-l-0030)
on the other hand i know it's a much more [polluter] than any of the newer model cars i [{] [{] [ha-] [/] [@] [}] [/] [@] [}] (sw2752a-ws97-l-0031)
yeah well i don't have any incentive to get out of it until it dies (sw2752a-ws97-l-0032)
and [%hesitation] that may be part of the [{] [{] [prob-] [/] [@] [}] [/] [@] [}] (sw2752a-ws97-l-0033)
yeah (sw2752a-ws97-l-0035)
yeah (sw2752a-ws97-l-0036)
yeah (sw2752a-ws97-l-0037)
oh [%hesitation] [{] [{] [yea-] [/] [@] [}] [/] [@] [}] (sw2752a-ws97-l-0038)
it's it's [%hesitation] pretty heavy up here i think (sw2752a-ws97-l-0039)
but i think it's mostly industrial is what i really [%hesitation] believe is the the main problem (sw2752a-ws97-l-0040)
and and [%hesitation] (sw2752a-ws97-l-0041)
and [%hesitation] [%hesitation] people [%hesitation] i don't think are paying as close attention to it in this area as they frankly should (sw2752a-ws97-l-0042)
i i we we seem to have a high [%hesitation] cancer rate up here in maryland (sw2752a-ws97-l-0043)
yeah (sw2752a-ws97-l-0044)
and [%hesitation] (sw2752a-ws97-l-0045)
well for instance breast cancer seems to be pretty rampant (sw2752a-ws97-l-0046)
and [%hesitation] i think (sw2752a-ws97-l-0047)
of course [prostrate] [cancer's] sort of bad for everybody (sw2752a-ws97-l-0048)
but [%hesitation] [{] [{] [thi-] [/] [@] [}] [/] [@] [}] [{] [{] [th-] [/] [@] [}] [/] [@] [}] this state was like the second (sw2752a-ws97-l-0049)
my wife's a registered nurse (sw2752a-ws97-l-0050)
and i think this state was like second this year from the top in terms of [%hesitation] cancer rate for just all kinds (sw2752a-ws97-l-0051)
and i can't help but believe that's not partially caused from pollution (sw2752a-ws97-l-0052)
[%hesitation] i just don't know exactly what it necessarily is (sw2752a-ws97-l-0053)
but i just can't believe this (sw2752a-ws97-l-0054)
now we have a lot of pollution being caused by [{] [{] [chlorofor-] [/] [@] [}] [/] [@] [}] [%hesitation] [fluorocarbons] which is the like freon twelve and freon twenty two (sw2752a-ws97-l-0055)
they use freon twenty two in air conditioning systems in houses and the like and heat pumps (sw2752a-ws97-l-0056)
and they use freon twelve in car air [conditioners] (sw2752a-ws97-l-0057)
and that's also what's causing our atmosphere to lose it's ozone layer (sw2752a-ws97-l-0058)
and i can't help believe if it's sufficient enough to make the atmosphere lose it's ozone layer that it's not acting as a [pollutant] in our lungs also (sw2752a-ws97-l-0059)
and having all kinds of effects (sw2752a-ws97-l-0060)
well they're working [{] [{] [n-] [/] [@] [}] [/] [@] [}] (sw2752a-ws97-l-0062)
i know [dupont] and dow and several other chemical companies are working [%hesitation] [feverishly] to try to come up with a substitute for [fluorocarbons] (sw2752a-ws97-l-0063)
and who ever does is going to make [%hesitation] a [mint] (sw2752a-ws97-l-0064)
because if they ever come up with a reasonable working agent in place of [fluorocarbons] then [%hesitation] (sw2752a-ws97-l-0065)
well they used to be (sw2752a-ws97-l-0066)
but they made them take it out of that (sw2752a-ws97-l-0067)
right (sw2752a-ws97-l-0068)
no (sw2752a-ws97-l-0069)
they they passed a law and made them take [fluorocarbons] out of the aerosol containers (sw2752a-ws97-l-0070)
and that was a move in the right direction (sw2752a-ws97-l-0071)
we are doing some things to try to correct the problem (sw2752a-ws97-l-0072)
but there are more things we could do (sw2752a-ws97-l-0073)
and getting rid of old cars like i said is one way to help correct the problem (sw2752a-ws97-l-0074)
[%hesitation] just trying to i think be careful [%hesitation] with the way you handle garbage (sw2752a-ws97-l-0075)
i notice in this state (sw2752a-ws97-l-0076)
i don't know if you're doing it in texas yet or not (sw2752a-ws97-l-0077)
but in this state we have special containers now we have to put all our cans and bottles and plastic pieces [%hesitation] you know containers in (sw2752a-ws97-l-0078)
yeah (sw2752a-ws97-l-0080)
well we are doing it pretty religiously in our group too (sw2752a-ws97-l-0081)
but they [%hesitation] (sw2752a-ws97-l-0082)
in one of the counties here they're actually doing a trial program of having a trash police (sw2752a-ws97-l-0083)
they have a lady that goes around like a meter maid (sw2752a-ws97-l-0084)
and she spot checks people's trash and if [{] [{] [they-] [/] [@] [}] [/] [@] [}] (sw2752a-ws97-l-0085)
well yes (sw2752b-ws97-l-0002)
we do have pollution in houston (sw2752b-ws97-l-0003)
well it it (sw2752b-ws97-l-0005)
some (sw2752b-ws97-l-0006)
i think it depends on [%hesitation] you know what the cloud cover (sw2752b-ws97-l-0007)
and like right now it's [%hesitation] it's kind of overcast you know (sw2752b-ws97-l-0008)
it's hot (sw2752b-ws97-l-0009)
sun is trying tries to shine through (sw2752b-ws97-l-0010)
but it's it's holding in this this pollution (sw2752b-ws97-l-0011)
and (sw2752b-ws97-l-0012)
i think so (sw2752b-ws97-l-0013)
and [%hesitation] (sw2752b-ws97-l-0014)
we have [%hesitation] pasadena texas which is sort of between here and you know heading toward galveston (sw2752b-ws97-l-0015)
i mean it's still part it's part of the (sw2752b-ws97-l-0016)
well i think it's industry (sw2752b-ws97-l-0017)
and i think it's cars (sw2752b-ws97-l-0018)
i'll (sw2752b-ws97-l-0019)
well maybe not (sw2752b-ws97-l-0020)
but it it sure it sure is (sw2752b-ws97-l-0021)
you know it (sw2752b-ws97-l-0022)
i i know that when i'm when i'm behind a car (sw2752b-ws97-l-0023)
and [%hesitation] sometimes [%hesitation] i can really smell especially diesel and things like that (sw2752b-ws97-l-0024)
you know comes right in to my air conditioner (sw2752b-ws97-l-0025)
and you know my head (sw2752b-ws97-l-0026)
i'm so stopped up right now (sw2752b-ws97-l-0027)
i don't know if it's [%hesitation] if it's partly from what's blooming you know right now pollen and stuff like that (sw2752b-ws97-l-0028)
that's part of it (sw2752b-ws97-l-0029)
but [%hesitation] (sw2752b-ws97-l-0030)
[uhhuh] (sw2752b-ws97-l-0031)
you mean [%hesitation] fifty percent pollution total from that comes from (sw2752b-ws97-l-0033)
oh [uhhuh] (sw2752b-ws97-l-0034)
right (sw2752b-ws97-l-0037)
[{] [{] [we-] [/] [@] [}] [/] [@] [}] you all have pollution in your part of the country [%hesitation] from industry (sw2752b-ws97-l-0038)
really (sw2752b-ws97-l-0039)
like what type (sw2752b-ws97-l-0040)
any particular kind or just all (sw2752b-ws97-l-0041)
kinds (sw2752b-ws97-l-0043)
[uhhuh] (sw2752b-ws97-l-0044)
well what can we do about the the the the air conditioning problem (sw2752b-ws97-l-0045)
is that also what's in [%hesitation] [{] [{] [hairsp-] [/] [@] [}] [/] [@] [}] aerosol (sw2752b-ws97-l-0047)
even [%hesitation] so so the aerosol is still aerosol (sw2752b-ws97-l-0048)
but it doesn't have anything that's damaging (sw2752b-ws97-l-0049)
oh that's good (sw2752b-ws97-l-0051)
here they've just started started doing that (sw2752b-ws97-l-0052)
it's it's you know (sw2752b-ws97-l-0053)
you're not you don't have to (sw2752b-ws97-l-0054)
but [{] [{] [a-] [/] [@] [}] [/] [@] [}] (sw2752b-ws97-l-0097)
you know (sw2752b-ws97-l-0103)
i i know (sw2752b-ws97-l-0104)
i (sw2752b-ws97-l-0108)
am (sw2752b-ws97-l-0113)
the latin american situation [{] [{] [is-] [/] [@] [}] [/] [@] [}] (sw2753a-ws97-l-0001)
the last development i know of was the military and financial assistance columbia for the for the drug [%hesitation] control (sw2753a-ws97-l-0002)
and i support that fully (sw2753a-ws97-l-0003)
i'm not sure we have the right solution to it (sw2753a-ws97-l-0004)
but at least we're we're going to the source of the problem (sw2753a-ws97-l-0005)
and [%hesitation] the source of supply (sw2753a-ws97-l-0006)
the problem is here (sw2753a-ws97-l-0007)
but the source of supply is there (sw2753a-ws97-l-0008)
in fact [%hesitation] i think a lot of [{] [{] [th-] [/] [@] [}] [/] [@] [}] (sw2753a-ws97-l-0009)
i've been to [%hesitation] peru several times (sw2753a-ws97-l-0010)
i've never made it to other parts of south america (sw2753a-ws97-l-0011)
but [%hesitation] i have been to peru (sw2753a-ws97-l-0012)
and they need some assistance down there (sw2753a-ws97-l-0013)
and i'm sure that [%hesitation] as an [undeveloped] country they look look for it (sw2753a-ws97-l-0014)
but there is not exactly a lot of [%hesitation] [fiscal] responsibility there (sw2753a-ws97-l-0015)
yes (sw2753a-ws97-l-0016)
right (sw2753a-ws97-l-0017)
and i i think that [%hesitation] they need guidance and assistance (sw2753a-ws97-l-0018)
but they need to learn how to stand on their own own two feet also (sw2753a-ws97-l-0019)
[uhhuh] (sw2753a-ws97-l-0020)
no no the and the poor are extremely poor (sw2753a-ws97-l-0021)
i know (sw2753a-ws97-l-0022)
i know [%hesitation] some of the areas in in texas seem poor (sw2753a-ws97-l-0023)
but until you've seen some of those [%hesitation] native latin americans come down from the hills you can't imagine what poor is (sw2753a-ws97-l-0024)
and [%hesitation] the worst scene i've ever had i think was [%hesitation] someone eating out of out of a garbage can along the streets in [lima] peru (sw2753a-ws97-l-0025)
oh yes (sw2753a-ws97-l-0026)
yes (sw2753a-ws97-l-0027)
[uhhuh] (sw2753a-ws97-l-0028)
oh the there's a joke (sw2753a-ws97-l-0029)
the the [graft] and the [%hesitation] payoffs down there are are an accepted way (sw2753a-ws97-l-0030)
and in a way (sw2753a-ws97-l-0031)
and there's there's a sad joke (sw2753a-ws97-l-0032)
i guess all jokes are really sad (sw2753a-ws97-l-0033)
but there's a joke about the [%hesitation] [ambassador] from latin america that came to visit a senator in the u s and was taken to his home for dinner (sw2753a-ws97-l-0034)
and the [%hesitation] (sw2753a-ws97-l-0035a)
home was [palatial] (sw2753a-ws97-l-0035b)
they had five or six servants you know and and a lot of expensive [%hesitation] [holdings] and all that (sw2753a-ws97-l-0036)
and the [ambassador] said but i know what you make as a u s senator (sw2753a-ws97-l-0037)
how can you afford all of this (sw2753a-ws97-l-0038)
and he said come i'll show you (sw2753a-ws97-l-0039)
and he walked out in the backyard (sw2753a-ws97-l-0040)
and the [%hesitation] senator said do you see that hospital over there (sw2753a-ws97-l-0041)
and the [ambassador] said yes (sw2753a-ws97-l-0042)
and he [patted] his pocket (sw2753a-ws97-l-0043)
and he said fifteen percent (sw2753a-ws97-l-0044)
he said you see that school over there (sw2753a-ws97-l-0045)
and the [ambassador] said yes (sw2753a-ws97-l-0046)
and he pot [patted] his pocket and he said fifteen percent (sw2753a-ws97-l-0047)
so (sw2753a-ws97-l-0048)
so the next year the senator went to latin america to visit the [ambassador] and was treated to dinner in his home (sw2753a-ws97-l-0049)
and it was twice as large and four times as many servants (sw2753a-ws97-l-0050)
he said well i know how poor your country is (sw2753a-ws97-l-0051)
how can you afford this [%hesitation] in such a poor country (sw2753a-ws97-l-0052)
and he he said come i'll show (sw2753a-ws97-l-0053)
[{]  [{] [-a] [/] [@] [}] [/] [@] [}] he walked out in the backyard (sw2753a-ws97-l-0054)
and he said do you see that hospital over there (sw2753a-ws97-l-0055)
and the senator looked (sw2753a-ws97-l-0056)
and he couldn't see anything (sw2753a-ws97-l-0057)
said no (sw2753a-ws97-l-0058)
and the [ambassador] [potted] [patted] his pocket and said one hundred percent (sw2753a-ws97-l-0059)
so (sw2753a-ws97-l-0060)
you know (sw2753a-ws97-l-0062)
it's a sad story (sw2753a-ws97-l-0063)
but (sw2753a-ws97-l-0064)
yes (sw2753a-ws97-l-0065)
yes (sw2753a-ws97-l-0066)
but it [%hesitation] it is a problem (sw2753a-ws97-l-0067)
[uhhuh] (sw2753a-ws97-l-0068)
yeah (sw2753a-ws97-l-0070)
well the [{] [{] [oth-] [/] [@] [}] [/] [@] [}] the other instance i think of their [inability] to to handle things and the [cholera] and hepatitis [epidemics] now in in latin america (sw2753a-ws97-l-0072)
and it shows the the [unpreparedness] for such such a problem (sw2753a-ws97-l-0073)
and yet they're so (sw2753a-ws97-l-0074)
[uhhuh] (sw2753b-ws97-l-0001)
[uhhuh] (sw2753b-ws97-l-0002)
that's true (sw2753b-ws97-l-0003)
very definitely so (sw2753b-ws97-l-0004)
[uhhuh] (sw2753b-ws97-l-0005)
no (sw2753b-ws97-l-0006)
very immature in that respect (sw2753b-ws97-l-0007)
i agree (sw2753b-ws97-l-0008)
i think that for so long power financially [%hesitation] [governmentally] every which way was in the hands of such a few that there's not the middle class that we we perceive (sw2753b-ws97-l-0009)
are extremely poor (sw2753b-ws97-l-0010)
that's correct (sw2753b-ws97-l-0011)
[uhhuh] (sw2753b-ws97-l-0012)
[{] [{] [m-] [/] [@] [}] [/] [@] [}] [{] [{] [i'm-] [/] [@] [}] [/] [@] [}] just very happy to get that (sw2753b-ws97-l-0013)
i have a brother who spent two years in [bolivia] (sw2753b-ws97-l-0014)
and this is very much his you know reaction that the rich are so rich and the poor are so poor (sw2753b-ws97-l-0015)
[uhhuh] (sw2753b-ws97-l-0016)
[uhhuh] (sw2753b-ws97-l-0017)
oh gosh (sw2753b-ws97-l-0018)
yep (sw2753b-ws97-l-0019)
intentions intention (sw2753b-ws97-l-0020)
i know (sw2753b-ws97-l-0021)
[%hesitation] i have a sister in law who is from nicaragua (sw2753b-ws97-l-0022)
and her family (sw2753b-ws97-l-0023)
her father was a fairly [%hesitation] high [ranking] official under [somoza] (sw2753b-ws97-l-0024)
and when that went down the tubes they had to get out (sw2753b-ws97-l-0025)
and seventeen children filtered through into into america through guatemala through mexico through honduras (sw2753b-ws97-l-0026)
you know two here three there one here you know this kind of thing until (sw2753b-ws97-l-0027)
and now [%hesitation] a couple of the older ones stayed or went back (sw2753b-ws97-l-0028)
but the rest of them now have their american citizenship and are are leading productive lives (sw2753b-ws97-l-0029)
but you [{] [{] [kn-] [/] [@] [}] [/] [@] [}] (sw2753b-ws97-l-0030)
yes (sw2753b-ws97-l-0031)
yes (sw2753b-ws97-l-0032)
okay (sw2836a-ws97-l-0001)
[%hesitation] as far as you know crime in the cities i'm sure [%hesitation] like in yours it's pretty pretty bad (sw2836a-ws97-l-0002)
[%hesitation] probably the biggest thing we've got going now is the robbery (sw2836a-ws97-l-0003)
and theft and probably murder are the two top ones that we have (sw2836a-ws97-l-0004)
how about you (sw2836a-ws97-l-0005)
[uhhuh] (sw2836a-ws97-l-0006)
[{] [{] [prob-] [/] [@] [}] [/] [@] [}] probably right if you look at it from that stand point (sw2836a-ws97-l-0007)
what [%hesitation] (sw2836a-ws97-l-0008)
is there anything that [%hesitation] that you particularly are concerned with in in your particular area as far as security and that sort of thing (sw2836a-ws97-l-0009)
[uhhuh] (sw2836a-ws97-l-0010)
do you live in a real small town or or out in the country (sw2836a-ws97-l-0011)
how far out from the city i mean do you (sw2836a-ws97-l-0012)
about fifteen miles (sw2836a-ws97-l-0013)
i live in a little suburb [%hesitation] which is i guess from dallas is twelve miles or so (sw2836a-ws97-l-0014)
but it's pretty congested (sw2836a-ws97-l-0015)
we are considered in the country (sw2836a-ws97-l-0016)
but it doesn't really feel like you're in the country (sw2836a-ws97-l-0017)
our major crimes in our immediate town [%hesitation] is probably robberies house robberies and very few instances of you know alcohol drug [%hesitation] reported (sw2836a-ws97-l-0018)
however i'm sure they're there (sw2836a-ws97-l-0019)
but [%hesitation] right now our neighborhood is running about [%hesitation] eighty percent of the homeowners have been robbed sometime during their their [%hesitation] existence in that neighborhood (sw2836a-ws97-l-0020)
and since that time everybody's gotten some sort of burglar system or you know [%hesitation] burglar alarms [%hesitation] and including the out [%hesitation] the outer perimeter type [%hesitation] devices [sensors] and things like that (sw2836a-ws97-l-0021)
it's cut back you know considerably (sw2836a-ws97-l-0022)
but it it just shifts it from our neighborhood to another neighborhood to another neighborhood (sw2836a-ws97-l-0023)
so it still [%hesitation] remains city wide pretty pretty high (sw2836a-ws97-l-0024)
[%hesitation] i would say the majority of it's happening during the day [%hesitation] between probably ten in the morning and three in the afternoon (sw2836a-ws97-l-0025)
well most families most families they are young (sw2836a-ws97-l-0027)
and both people are working (sw2836a-ws97-l-0028)
so they're happening during the hours they're gone from work (sw2836a-ws97-l-0029)
[%hesitation] so [%hesitation] i would say that's probably their prime motivation (sw2836a-ws97-l-0030)
they'll they'll stalk your house and [%hesitation] look at your pattern and then go from there (sw2836a-ws97-l-0031)
[%hesitation] they classify most of them as professionals (sw2836a-ws97-l-0032)
[%hesitation] you get a few of them that are a little bit [sloppier] [%hesitation] just taking [%hesitation] you know just junk items that they they can just get you know ten to twenty bucks for real quick (sw2836a-ws97-l-0033)
probably the biggest items that [%hesitation] that you get in our neighborhood or would be the high [classed] automobiles (sw2836a-ws97-l-0034)
the [{] [{] [th-] [/] [@] [}] [/] [@] [}] mercedes volvos things that they can get you know big dollars for [%hesitation] jewelry are the major targets (sw2836a-ws97-l-0035)
guns that sort of stuff (sw2836a-ws97-l-0036)
very few you know penny penny [ante] stuff (sw2836a-ws97-l-0037)
well [%hesitation] the police force for one (sw2836a-ws97-l-0038)
i think they could [%hesitation] definitely add to the police force and the type equipment that they use (sw2836a-ws97-l-0039)
[%hesitation] it's (sw2836a-ws97-l-0040)
oh right now i think [%hesitation] we are about thirty thousand people (sw2836a-ws97-l-0041)
and there's only eight officers that patrol for thirty for that amount of people which is not very many (sw2836a-ws97-l-0042)
well the (sw2836a-ws97-l-0044)
course in our particular state [%hesitation] we have the prison overcrowding whatever (sw2836a-ws97-l-0045)
so they're giving the early release [%hesitation] (sw2836a-ws97-l-0046)
yeah (sw2836a-ws97-l-0047)
and and it's (sw2836a-ws97-l-0048)
i think what they need to do is stop building more jails and start giving [stiffer] sentences [%hesitation] (sw2836a-ws97-l-0049)
but for the (sw2836a-ws97-l-0050)
that would be certainly be a deterrent (sw2836a-ws97-l-0051)
and [%hesitation] not necessarily you know [%hesitation] give in to their [%hesitation] human rights desires (sw2836a-ws97-l-0052)
you know if they're overcrowded just keep [cramming] them in there till they just [suffocate] (sw2836a-ws97-l-0053)
[uhhuh] (sw2836b-ws97-l-0001)
[%hesitation] well i don't actually live in the city (sw2836b-ws97-l-0002)
but i'd probably say that's roughly right (sw2836b-ws97-l-0003)
i mean crimes against property seem to [outnumber] crimes against life (sw2836b-ws97-l-0004)
but i i think with the [%hesitation] current war on drugs and all this kind of stuff i'd say probably the police department would claim the number one crimes crimes are probably solicitation or [prostitution] [%hesitation] and sale of drugs (sw2836b-ws97-l-0005)
[uhhuh] (sw2836b-ws97-l-0006)
[%hesitation] where i live no so it's not so bad (sw2836b-ws97-l-0007)
i mean i can basically leave my front door [unlocked] and not have to worry about it (sw2836b-ws97-l-0008)
[%hesitation] but i do have friends that live in the city (sw2836b-ws97-l-0009)
and i think that they get a lot of [fallout] from this war on drug thing [%hesitation] just because there are like crack houses you know on their street and stuff like this (sw2836b-ws97-l-0010)
i live out in the country (sw2836b-ws97-l-0011)
yeah (sw2836b-ws97-l-0012)
i'm about fifteen miles out (sw2836b-ws97-l-0013)
[uhhuh] (sw2836b-ws97-l-0014)
huh (sw2836b-ws97-l-0016a)
huh (sw2836b-ws97-l-0016b)
[uhhuh] (sw2836b-ws97-l-0017)
[uhhuh] (sw2836b-ws97-l-0018)
wow (sw2836b-ws97-l-0019)
that's huge (sw2836b-ws97-l-0020)
[uhhuh] (sw2836b-ws97-l-0021)
[uhhuh] (sw2836b-ws97-l-0022)
are they are there any theories on why this is happening (sw2836b-ws97-l-0023)
[uhhuh] (sw2836b-ws97-l-0024)
but why (sw2836b-ws97-l-0025)
[uhhuh] (sw2836b-ws97-l-0027)
[uhhuh] (sw2836b-ws97-l-0028)
so they're professionals (sw2836b-ws97-l-0029)
huh (sw2836b-ws97-l-0030)
[uhhuh] (sw2836b-ws97-l-0031)
[uhhuh] (sw2836b-ws97-l-0032)
huh (sw2836b-ws97-l-0033)
what do you think could done to reduce that sort of crime (sw2836b-ws97-l-0034)
[uhhuh] (sw2836b-ws97-l-0036)
right (sw2836b-ws97-l-0037)
but that mean that's going to tend to (sw2836b-ws97-l-0038)
and it seems to me that sort of approach will tend to simply make the cost of committing the crime slightly higher (sw2836b-ws97-l-0039)
in other words you've increased the [probability] of somebody being caught a little bit (sw2836b-ws97-l-0040)
the real question is how do you convince people not to commit such crimes in the first place (sw2836b-ws97-l-0041)
right (sw2836b-ws97-l-0042)
they're doing that in our state [{] [{] [to-] [/] [@] [}] [/] [@] [}] (sw2836b-ws97-l-0043)
so you think that would be a deterrent (sw2836b-ws97-l-0044)
yes (sw2838a-ws97-l-0001)
[%hesitation] right (sw2838a-ws97-l-0002)
yes a (sw2838a-ws97-l-0003)
right (sw2838a-ws97-l-0004)
yeah (sw2838a-ws97-l-0005)
right (sw2838a-ws97-l-0006)
they do (sw2838a-ws97-l-0007)
and you boy you can get them on either side (sw2838a-ws97-l-0008)
and just like you say (sw2838a-ws97-l-0009)
[%hesitation] well i think i i guess i'd have to place myself [%hesitation] probably seven or eight (sw2838a-ws97-l-0010)
because (sw2838a-ws97-l-0011)
are not (sw2838a-ws97-l-0012)
the way it would onto no control (sw2838a-ws97-l-0013)
i'm sorry excuse me that (sw2838a-ws97-l-0014)
[%hesitation] two or three (sw2838a-ws97-l-0015)
[%hesitation] i was going the wrong direction (sw2838a-ws97-l-0016)
[%hesitation] because [%hesitation] we had a neighbor child that was killed by another child because they had a gun in the house (sw2838a-ws97-l-0017)
and the father kept the bullets in a separate place (sw2838a-ws97-l-0018)
but the little boy was five years old and was [%hesitation] intelligent enough to (sw2838a-ws97-l-0019)
[%hesitation] he knew where booth both places were loaded the gun (sw2838a-ws97-l-0020)
and they were playing cowboys and indians (sw2838a-ws97-l-0021)
and he shot the other little boy right between the eyes (sw2838a-ws97-l-0022)
so [%hesitation] (sw2838a-ws97-l-0023)
i mean it (sw2838a-ws97-l-0024)
it destroyed two families [%hesitation] in just that instant (sw2838a-ws97-l-0025)
and and i a lot of people say that they need it for protection [%hesitation] (sw2838a-ws97-l-0026)
having worked at one time in baltimore (sw2838a-ws97-l-0027)
or (sw2838a-ws97-l-0028)
i don't know if you're in the big city (sw2838a-ws97-l-0029)
dallas (sw2838a-ws97-l-0031)
that's a big city (sw2838a-ws97-l-0032)
[%hesitation] then you know that [%hesitation] [%hesitation] (sw2838a-ws97-l-0033)
if you live anywhere real close that [%hesitation] (sw2838a-ws97-l-0034)
the safety is [%hesitation] (sw2838a-ws97-l-0035)
some people argue that they need a gun to make sure that they aren't going to get shot because of the incidences of break ins and you know (sw2838a-ws97-l-0036)
but [%hesitation] [%hesitation] we have never had a gun in the house with my children growing up (sw2838a-ws97-l-0037)
[%hesitation] i [%hesitation] (sw2838a-ws97-l-0038)
once [%hesitation] [%hesitation] knew a fellow that had had been a policeman (sw2838a-ws97-l-0039)
and he said that if you pull a gun on a [robber] he's going to assume that you know how to use it well (sw2838a-ws97-l-0040)
and he's going to you know try to shoot first (sw2838a-ws97-l-0041)
[%hesitation] so you know if he's got one (sw2838a-ws97-l-0042)
[%hesitation] and if not (sw2838a-ws97-l-0043)
then usually they [%hesitation] (sw2838a-ws97-l-0044)
if he's got a knife or whatever that can throw it at you (sw2838a-ws97-l-0045)
i mean you know (sw2838a-ws97-l-0046)
they they he said that it it is better not to have (sw2838a-ws97-l-0047)
especially myself now i'm a widow (sw2838a-ws97-l-0048)
and [%hesitation] (sw2838a-ws97-l-0049)
i so i'm when my handicapped son is is not at home i'm by myself (sw2838a-ws97-l-0050)
but [%hesitation] there's (sw2838a-ws97-l-0051)
i still won't have a gun in the house because he said it's really [%hesitation] playing russian [roulette] if you do (sw2838a-ws97-l-0052)
that's (sw2838a-ws97-l-0064)
right (sw2838a-ws97-l-0089)
that's right (sw2838a-ws97-l-0091)
gun control seems to be a rather [%hesitation] timely topic with all that's going on legislation wise (sw2838b-ws97-l-0001)
and [%hesitation] the the interesting scale that they assigned it [%hesitation] the one being a banned and ten being no regulations or totally free (sw2838b-ws97-l-0002)
i'd have to put myself pretty much in the middle i guess (sw2838b-ws97-l-0003)
i i don't mind regulating all of the the guns (sw2838b-ws97-l-0004)
and i would certainly call for a ban on certain types (sw2838b-ws97-l-0005)
now the the wisdom as to which types that's going to be a debate forever i would assume (sw2838b-ws97-l-0006)
[%hesitation] the method of of controlling it well that's all into how much money you want to put into the the controls (sw2838b-ws97-l-0007)
[%hesitation] one point that was made in the house hearings (sw2838b-ws97-l-0008)
the representative who once stood up and said that [%hesitation] you know we can check a guy's credit card instantly (sw2838b-ws97-l-0010)
but [%hesitation] we don't want to check his background (sw2838b-ws97-l-0011)
and of course those are two different issues as far as privacy goes (sw2838b-ws97-l-0012)
[%hesitation] (sw2838b-ws97-l-0013)
but there's still the the technology exists to to check it if they want (sw2838b-ws97-l-0014)
so it's it's kind of a (sw2838b-ws97-l-0015)
[%hesitation] i guess you could put a dollar figure on it if you really want to make that kind of an effort and regulate it like that (sw2838b-ws97-l-0016)
and then you've got the group of people that decide that there's there's no particular reason to have them at all (sw2838b-ws97-l-0017)
and you got to balance those against the ones that say there is some sport to it (sw2838b-ws97-l-0018)
and i guess i would fall more in the the realm that i like the sport issue of it (sw2838b-ws97-l-0019)
but i i could give it up without too much trouble (sw2838b-ws97-l-0020)
it's not the world's most [pleasurable] thing (sw2838b-ws97-l-0021)
and it costs a bit to do it [%hesitation] finding ranges and things like that (sw2838b-ws97-l-0022)
[%hesitation] i have shot variety of guns for a number of years (sw2838b-ws97-l-0023)
but it's just it's not like golf or whatever (sw2838b-ws97-l-0024)
i mean there are other things that you could go do (sw2838b-ws97-l-0025)
so [%hesitation] i i don't see the the joy of shooting as as that much of a driving factor (sw2838b-ws97-l-0026)
i think that society could easily swing the scale the other direction just for the sake of safety of the number of kids that tend to get hurt (sw2838b-ws97-l-0027)
i don't even keep the gun in our house (sw2838b-ws97-l-0028)
so [%hesitation] we don't have that problem (sw2838b-ws97-l-0029)
but [%hesitation] (sw2838b-ws97-l-0030)
it's a hard hard topic i guess (sw2838b-ws97-l-0031)
a lot of people have a lot hard issue a lot of hard feelings about it (sw2838b-ws97-l-0032)
[uhhuh] (sw2838b-ws97-l-0033)
[uhhuh] (sw2838b-ws97-l-0034a)
boy (sw2838b-ws97-l-0034b)
right (sw2838b-ws97-l-0035)
dallas (sw2838b-ws97-l-0036)
[uhhuh] (sw2838b-ws97-l-0037)
yeah (sw2838b-ws97-l-0038)
right (sw2838b-ws97-l-0039)
right (sw2838b-ws97-l-0040)
yeah (sw2838b-ws97-l-0041)
about the only circumstances that they'd be of any value is when you happen to already know that the the person was coming your way if (sw2838b-ws97-l-0042)
once you're surprised it's too late (sw2838b-ws97-l-0043)
and and the rare [{] [{] [cer-] [/] [@] [}] [/] [@] [}] (sw2838b-ws97-l-0044)
you know the very few of those [burglaries] actually occur in such a way that you knew the guy was coming (sw2838b-ws97-l-0045)
and had time to do anything about it (sw2838b-ws97-l-0046)
and i don't have that problem (sw2838b-ws97-l-0047)
as i don't use that argument as saying it's worth keeping one (sw2838b-ws97-l-0048)
in the [%hesitation] n r a's [%hesitation] claim that the [%hesitation] the constitutional the right to bear arms and that whole statement [%hesitation] (sw2838b-ws97-l-0049)
it is hard to know the original intent (sw2838b-ws97-l-0050)
but i i don't see it as that that difficult of a story to believe when the opposition says that [%hesitation] yeah it's the right to to arm a [militia] and as opposed to just the general public (sw2838b-ws97-l-0051)
i understand we're supposed to talk about [spaceflight] (sw3528a-ws97-l-0002)
i hope you know more about it than i do (sw3528a-ws97-l-0003)
oh is that right (sw3528a-ws97-l-0004)
i haven't read his book (sw3528a-ws97-l-0005)
i was so upset with texas that i haven't gotten into any more of his books because i thought it was horrible (sw3528a-ws97-l-0006)
well [{] [{] [i-] [/] [@] [}] [/] [@] [}] (sw3528a-ws97-l-0007)
and i don't think he was [truthful] in a lot of what he did in texas (sw3528a-ws97-l-0008)
so i wasn't sure how [credible] he was (sw3528a-ws97-l-0009)
but anyway what do you think we've gained from the [spaceflights] (sw3528a-ws97-l-0010)
ego trip (sw3528a-ws97-l-0011)
[uhhuh] (sw3528a-ws97-l-0012)
oh is that right (sw3528a-ws97-l-0013)
[uhhuh] (sw3528a-ws97-l-0014)
right (sw3528a-ws97-l-0015)
where do you live (sw3528a-ws97-l-0016)
are you living [{] [{] [i-] [/] [@] [}] [/] [@] [}] (sw3528a-ws97-l-0017)
am i talking to utah right now (sw3528a-ws97-l-0018)
oh oh great (sw3528a-ws97-l-0019)
cause i'm in dallas (sw3528a-ws97-l-0020)
i see (sw3528a-ws97-l-0021)
i see (sw3528a-ws97-l-0022)
carolyn [rash] (sw3528a-ws97-l-0023)
is her name [rash] carolyn [rash] (sw3528a-ws97-l-0024)
i see (sw3528a-ws97-l-0025)
i see (sw3528a-ws97-l-0026)
well you probably know a lot about [{] [{] [i-] [/] [@] [}] [/] [@] [}] (sw3528a-ws97-l-0027)
i wasn't sure that they were [blaming] that [splace] space disaster on one company (sw3528a-ws97-l-0028)
i hadn't heard that (sw3528a-ws97-l-0029)
[uhhuh] (sw3528a-ws97-l-0030)
[uhhuh] (sw3528a-ws97-l-0031)
oh yeah (sw3528a-ws97-l-0032)
oh yeah (sw3528a-ws97-l-0033)
i would think so too (sw3528a-ws97-l-0034)
you never think about that do you (sw3528a-ws97-l-0035)
i would think it would be harder to get up than it would be getting back down (sw3528a-ws97-l-0036)
[uhhuh] (sw3528a-ws97-l-0037)
right (sw3528a-ws97-l-0038)
well i saw one [{] [{] [o-] [/] [@] [}] [/] [@] [}] some those early space [capsules] at [smithsonian] (sw3528a-ws97-l-0039)
i'm sure you've seen more of them than i have (sw3528a-ws97-l-0040)
but you could see the [scorch] on them you know (sw3528a-ws97-l-0041)
they had those tiles (sw3528a-ws97-l-0042)
but you could see where they would come off in them how hot it got because it was still the [scorch] on them which was quite interested (sw3528a-ws97-l-0043)
well i (sw3528a-ws97-l-0044)
excuse me go ahead (sw3528a-ws97-l-0045)
oh you have (sw3528a-ws97-l-0046)
[uhhuh] (sw3528a-ws97-l-0047)
well these were the ones that john [glenn] went up in you know the old old ones (sw3528a-ws97-l-0048)
the very first [{] [{] [o-] [/] [@] [}] [/] [@] [}] (sw3528a-ws97-l-0049)
the little bell type thing (sw3528a-ws97-l-0050)
yeah (sw3528a-ws97-l-0051)
they really were (sw3528a-ws97-l-0052)
they just [%hesitation] (sw3528a-ws97-l-0053)
oh yeah [{] [{] [i-] [/] [@] [}] [/] [@] [}] (sw3528a-ws97-l-0054)
and [%hesitation] the whole thing is small (sw3528a-ws97-l-0055)
yeah you'd you i mean you actually put it on you know (sw3528a-ws97-l-0056)
you put it around you pretty much (sw3528a-ws97-l-0057)
it was so small (sw3528a-ws97-l-0058)
well i thought there was some medical benefits that we have learned from space (sw3528a-ws97-l-0059)
but did he go into that in the book (sw3528a-ws97-l-0060)
i guess that's just to sell us on it (sw3528a-ws97-l-0061)
oh yeah (sw3528a-ws97-l-0062)
[uhhuh] (sw3528a-ws97-l-0063)
well that's true (sw3528a-ws97-l-0064)
that's right (sw3528a-ws97-l-0066)
well do you think we should continue to support it at the level (sw3528a-ws97-l-0067)
well i thought probably one of the things they were we're doing that they didn't tell us was [spying] (sw3528a-ws97-l-0068)
because i think those satellites you know [{] [{] [your-] [/] [@] [}] [/] [@] [}] not satellites but the [spaceflights] could really spy (sw3528a-ws97-l-0069)
and with the with the russia's [demise] i didn't know if we should continue to support it at the current level (sw3528a-ws97-l-0070)
yeah (sw3528a-ws97-l-0071)
[uhhuh] (sw3528a-ws97-l-0072)
no (sw3528a-ws97-l-0073)
i don't (sw3528a-ws97-l-0074)
i don't either (sw3528a-ws97-l-0075)
good (sw3528b-ws97-l-0001)
thank you (sw3528b-ws97-l-0002)
yes (sw3528b-ws97-l-0003)
well i just got through renting reading [%hesitation] space by [%hesitation] james michener (sw3528b-ws97-l-0004)
and so that [%hesitation] helped out a little bit i think (sw3528b-ws97-l-0005)
well he tends to go into a lot of detail sometimes (sw3528b-ws97-l-0006)
oh is that right (sw3528b-ws97-l-0007)
well [%hesitation] i'm not sure to be honest with you [%hesitation] (sw3528b-ws97-l-0008)
this going to the moon seemed to be a exciting adventure (sw3528b-ws97-l-0009)
and [%hesitation] it wasn't yeah (sw3528b-ws97-l-0010)
it was nice to go there (sw3528b-ws97-l-0011)
but i don't know that it really benefitted [mankind] that much (sw3528b-ws97-l-0012)
i happen to live not too far away from (sw3528b-ws97-l-0013)
[%hesitation] i've actually worked for the company that [%hesitation] has been blamed for the [challenger] disaster [%hesitation] morton [thiakol] (sw3528b-ws97-l-0014)
and [%hesitation] you know that's been kind of a real negative feeling here (sw3528b-ws97-l-0015)
is (sw3528b-ws97-l-0016)
sure it was a you know very unfortunate thing that occurred there (sw3528b-ws97-l-0017)
and it's [%hesitation] (sw3528b-ws97-l-0018)
[%hesitation] we live in [%hesitation] utah (sw3528b-ws97-l-0019)
[uhhuh] (sw3528b-ws97-l-0020)
yeah (sw3528b-ws97-l-0021)
oh (sw3528b-ws97-l-0023)
i have a sister that lives in dallas (sw3528b-ws97-l-0024)
that's how we got hooked up to the program was her her husband works for penney's there (sw3528b-ws97-l-0025)
so (sw3528b-ws97-l-0026)
pardon me (sw3528b-ws97-l-0027)
no her name is [%hesitation] my last name is [skidmore] (sw3528b-ws97-l-0028)
and her her husband's name is his last name is wade (sw3528b-ws97-l-0029)
yeah (sw3528b-ws97-l-0030)
well they were (sw3528b-ws97-l-0031)
there was [%hesitation] (sw3528b-ws97-l-0032)
apparently the specifications for the joints [%hesitation] (sw3528b-ws97-l-0033)
they were not to perform in [%hesitation] cold weather (sw3528b-ws97-l-0034)
and [%hesitation] apparently there was definitely a a joint that did not not seal (sw3528b-ws97-l-0035)
and [%hesitation] if you've ever seen the size of those [%hesitation] motors that put it into space (sw3528b-ws97-l-0036)
i mean they're as long as a football field practically and about twelve foot in [diameter] (sw3528b-ws97-l-0037)
and and there is a lot of pressure lot of [{] [{] [th-] [/] [@] [}] [/] [@] [}] [thrust] to get that much weight up in the air (sw3528b-ws97-l-0038)
so it's this book was interesting though (sw3528b-ws97-l-0039)
talked about how a lot of the problems they have to come overcome to [%hesitation] (sw3528b-ws97-l-0041)
it's a very complex [%hesitation] situation to go into space (sw3528b-ws97-l-0042)
the thing that he went into quite a bit of detail about how how much of a problem it is to [re] enter the [earth's] atmosphere (sw3528b-ws97-l-0044)
yeah (sw3528b-ws97-l-0046)
but they have to come in at a just the right angle (sw3528b-ws97-l-0047)
if you come in at the wrong angle what happens is they bounce off and go back into space (sw3528b-ws97-l-0048)
and if they come into it at a different angle there is so much friction that it burns them up (sw3528b-ws97-l-0049)
so (sw3528b-ws97-l-0050)
oh (sw3528b-ws97-l-0051)
[uhhuh] (sw3528b-ws97-l-0052)
yeah (sw3528b-ws97-l-0053)
yeah (sw3528b-ws97-l-0054)
i've i've i would say i've never i've never seen an actual [capsule] (sw3528b-ws97-l-0055)
i've seen more more of the motors that that they produced out there (sw3528b-ws97-l-0056)
[uhhuh] (sw3528b-ws97-l-0057)
yeah (sw3528b-ws97-l-0058)
people have [commented] how [%hesitation] they were surprised at how small they were (sw3528b-ws97-l-0059)
looked pretty [confining] huh (sw3528b-ws97-l-0060)
is that right (sw3528b-ws97-l-0061)
huh (sw3528b-ws97-l-0062)
not really [%hesitation] (sw3528b-ws97-l-0063)
one thing (sw3528b-ws97-l-0064)
i know one thing they've they've mentioned that i didn't get from the book by the way (sw3528b-ws97-l-0065)
but it they've talked about [%hesitation] (sw3528b-ws97-l-0066)
they're able to [manufacture] [%hesitation] different kinds of [crystals] and ball bearings and things like that in a zero gravity state that they turned out being almost [%hesitation] nearly perfect as far as a ball bearing goes (sw3528b-ws97-l-0067)
it's perfectly round (sw3528b-ws97-l-0068)
but i'm not sure you have to go to outer space to achieve that zero gravity (sw3528b-ws97-l-0069)
yeah (sw3528b-ws97-l-0070)
so (sw3528b-ws97-l-0071a)
[uhhuh] (sw3528b-ws97-l-0071b)
yes (sw3528b-ws97-l-0072)
[%hesitation] i think they have cut it back to be honest with you from from the glory days when they did the apollo shots on the moon (sw3528b-ws97-l-0073)
[%hesitation] i appreciate having the satellites (sw3528b-ws97-l-0074)
you know that's certainly made it nice for other purpose (sw3528b-ws97-l-0075)
i don't know if you have a satellite dish or not (sw3528b-ws97-l-0076)
we don't (sw3528b-ws97-l-0077)
but i i know that's certainly helped a lot (sw3528b-ws97-l-0078)
okay (sw3756a-ws97-l-0001)
have you painted something lately (sw3756a-ws97-l-0002)
yeah (sw3756a-ws97-l-0003)
oh yeah (sw3756a-ws97-l-0004)
another bedroom (sw3756a-ws97-l-0005)
yeah (sw3756a-ws97-l-0006)
yeah (sw3756a-ws97-l-0007)
yeah (sw3756a-ws97-l-0008)
oh yeah (sw3756a-ws97-l-0009)
oh heavens (sw3756a-ws97-l-0010)
well i painted the outside of my house and one bathroom (sw3756a-ws97-l-0011)
but i get i have that trouble with the the ceiling you know the [%hesitation] what is that blows the blow ceiling you know where you get around the edge (sw3756a-ws97-l-0012)
[uhhuh] (sw3756a-ws97-l-0013)
[uhhuh] (sw3756a-ws97-l-0014)
well how do you get the edge though (sw3756a-ws97-l-0015)
the the straight edge (sw3756a-ws97-l-0016)
oh i see (sw3756a-ws97-l-0017)
[uhhuh] (sw3756a-ws97-l-0018)
[uhhuh] (sw3756a-ws97-l-0019)
huh well are you going to paint the outside of your house too (sw3756a-ws97-l-0020)
oh really (sw3756a-ws97-l-0021)
oh how nice (sw3756a-ws97-l-0022)
yeah (sw3756a-ws97-l-0023)
[uhhuh] (sw3756a-ws97-l-0024)
oh that'd be nice (sw3756a-ws97-l-0025)
huh (sw3756a-ws97-l-0026)
or two tone or two tone you know (sw3756a-ws97-l-0027)
[uhhuh] (sw3756a-ws97-l-0028)
well [{] [{] [th-] [/] [@] [}] [/] [@] [}] white (sw3756a-ws97-l-0029)
but i have a problem (sw3756a-ws97-l-0030)
mike can't get up high (sw3756a-ws97-l-0031)
and we can't paint the [chimney] (sw3756a-ws97-l-0032)
oh we have one of those ladders (sw3756a-ws97-l-0033)
we are just not willing to get up that high (sw3756a-ws97-l-0034)
well we did too (sw3756a-ws97-l-0035)
we did it in the fall (sw3756a-ws97-l-0036)
and it's just it's too high (sw3756a-ws97-l-0037)
it's really scary (sw3756a-ws97-l-0038)
but and the only thing i would consider doing a professional is maybe doing that (sw3756a-ws97-l-0039)
but it (sw3756a-ws97-l-0040)
other than doing our own work i prefer it to a professional (sw3756a-ws97-l-0041)
yeah (sw3756a-ws97-l-0042)
[uhhuh] (sw3756a-ws97-l-0043)
[uhhuh] (sw3756a-ws97-l-0044)
the [blowers] (sw3756a-ws97-l-0045)
oh oh oh oh i know what you are talking about [%hesitation] (sw3756a-ws97-l-0046)
[scaffold] (sw3756a-ws97-l-0047)
that's it (sw3756a-ws97-l-0048)
huh (sw3756a-ws97-l-0049)
yeah (sw3756a-ws97-l-0051)
oh my (sw3756a-ws97-l-0052)
so that was worth it getting a professional for that (sw3756a-ws97-l-0053)
oh i think that's what we might have to do with the [chimney] (sw3756a-ws97-l-0054)
but other than that it was pretty easy doing it [ourself] and [caulking] it and everything [ourself] (sw3756a-ws97-l-0055)
it wasn't too bad (sw3756a-ws97-l-0056)
i mean you [{] [{] [sav-] [/] [@] [}] [/] [@] [}] (sw3756a-ws97-l-0057)
shoot maybe a hundred and fifty (sw3756a-ws97-l-0058)
you know since it's a one story (sw3756a-ws97-l-0059)
but we did [%hesitation] like two heavy coats over it (sw3756a-ws97-l-0060)
but then in that way you know you are assured you did a good job than you are you know if you hire someone to do it (sw3756a-ws97-l-0061)
[uhhuh] (sw3756a-ws97-l-0062)
[uhhuh] (sw3756a-ws97-l-0063)
[uhhuh] (sw3756a-ws97-l-0064)
my word (sw3756a-ws97-l-0065)
[uhhuh] (sw3756a-ws97-l-0066)
[uhhuh] (sw3756a-ws97-l-0067)
oh my word (sw3756a-ws97-l-0068)
[uhhuh] (sw3756a-ws97-l-0069)
[uhhuh] (sw3756a-ws97-l-0070)
[uhhuh] (sw3756a-ws97-l-0071)
oh my word (sw3756a-ws97-l-0072)
so that was really worth it painting his own house (sw3756a-ws97-l-0073)
oh my word (sw3756a-ws97-l-0074)
oh my word (sw3756a-ws97-l-0075)
well he really saved in that way (sw3756a-ws97-l-0076)
but yeah (sw3756a-ws97-l-0077)
i think we are going to do [%hesitation] another bathroom (sw3756a-ws97-l-0078)
but [%hesitation] i think i will probably just do it in a roller (sw3756a-ws97-l-0079)
want to do it about the same color and just be a [{] [{] [lit-] [/] [@] [}] [/] [@] [}] (sw3756a-ws97-l-0080)
yes (sw3756b-ws97-l-0001)
i have (sw3756b-ws97-l-0002)
that room i showed you (sw3756b-ws97-l-0003)
and then since then we have painted the bedroom (sw3756b-ws97-l-0004)
yeah (sw3756b-ws97-l-0005)
i showed you that one too didn't i (sw3756b-ws97-l-0006)
the brown one (sw3756b-ws97-l-0007)
yeah (sw3756b-ws97-l-0008)
the one that looks like a [fudgesicle] (sw3756b-ws97-l-0009)
yeah (sw3756b-ws97-l-0010)
yeah (sw3756b-ws97-l-0011)
oh yeah (sw3756b-ws97-l-0012)
well that's hard (sw3756b-ws97-l-0013)
now i asked jan asked somebody recently about how you do that [%hesitation] when you paint the ceilings if you know where you have got that textured stuff that they have special rollers that are real soft and [furry] that you paint that with (sw3756b-ws97-l-0014)
how you get the edge (sw3756b-ws97-l-0015)
you just have to be real careful (sw3756b-ws97-l-0016)
we use [%hesitation] [%hesitation] a two inch brush with [%hesitation] on a slant (sw3756b-ws97-l-0017)
and that mostly does it even though you still make mistakes (sw3756b-ws97-l-0018)
well yeah (sw3756b-ws97-l-0020)
i think i am going to do it this spring actually (sw3756b-ws97-l-0021)
there there six houses (sw3756b-ws97-l-0023)
see the people that own the house they [%hesitation] pay for anything like that we do as far as the the materials (sw3756b-ws97-l-0024)
there's three houses on this street the same color of yellow out of six houses (sw3756b-ws97-l-0025)
so i'm thinking i'm going to change it to something you know (sw3756b-ws97-l-0026)
the brick is multi color with mostly earth [tones] (sw3756b-ws97-l-0027)
i think i am going to put something like a brown on it on the outside yeah and maybe a little deeper brown in the entry way or something so it will stand out a little (sw3756b-ws97-l-0028)
yeah (sw3756b-ws97-l-0029)
there are some columns that could be painted a different color too (sw3756b-ws97-l-0030)
what color did you paint your house (sw3756b-ws97-l-0031)
on the out (sw3756b-ws97-l-0032)
well you got to get one of those ladders (sw3756b-ws97-l-0033)
oh yeah (sw3756b-ws97-l-0034)
[{] [{] [well-] [/] [@] [}] [/] [@] [}] a friend of mine that lives out in your neighborhood he's done his house (sw3756b-ws97-l-0035)
and that's what he (sw3756b-ws97-l-0036)
i was out there last week (sw3756b-ws97-l-0037)
and he has finished everything except the [chimney] (sw3756b-ws97-l-0038)
yeah (sw3756b-ws97-l-0039)
and our house in new mexico it was stucco (sw3756b-ws97-l-0040)
but we had all this trim to paint and lots of it (sw3756b-ws97-l-0041)
and we did basically seventy five percent of the house (sw3756b-ws97-l-0042)
and then i was afraid to do the [eaves] way up high and stuff (sw3756b-ws97-l-0043)
so i hired this man to come in and do it young kid (sw3756b-ws97-l-0044)
and he came with with his own [{] [{] [r-] [/] [@] [}] [/] [@] [}] (sw3756b-ws97-l-0045)
right [%hesitation] what do you call those things (sw3756b-ws97-l-0046)
no (sw3756b-ws97-l-0047)
those where you built like a [rafter] thing (sw3756b-ws97-l-0048)
yeah (sw3756b-ws97-l-0049)
[scaffolds] (sw3756b-ws97-l-0050)
he came and did it that way (sw3756b-ws97-l-0051)
and i think he charged me a hundred dollars to finish up (sw3756b-ws97-l-0052)
and literally i wouldn't have done it with the [scaffolds] because all the places that i had left for him were above huge [humongous] [cactuses] (sw3756b-ws97-l-0053)
he fell he was dead (sw3756b-ws97-l-0054)
and he knew that (sw3756b-ws97-l-0055)
so (sw3756b-ws97-l-0056)
yeah (sw3756b-ws97-l-0057)
plus he cleaned up my mess (sw3756b-ws97-l-0058)
how much did it cost you to for the paint for the outside (sw3756b-ws97-l-0060)
yeah (sw3756b-ws97-l-0061)
yeah (sw3756b-ws97-l-0062)
that friend of mine that painted his house out there in your neighborhood he went [%hesitation] oh [{] [{] [f-] [/] [@] [}] [/] [@] [}] [furrows] i guess to buy his paint (sw3756b-ws97-l-0063)
and yet he bought like seventeen gallons (sw3756b-ws97-l-0064)
and anyway he when he checked out they [{] [{] [onl-] [/] [@] [}] [/] [@] [}] and he was using his [furrows] charge card too they only charged him for one gallon of paint like thirteen bucks or something (sw3756b-ws97-l-0065)
and he had he had the he had already carried a ladder outside and and told her that (sw3756b-ws97-l-0066)
and she [wrung] all that stuff up and made a mistake on the price of the paint (sw3756b-ws97-l-0067)
so she had to start all over again (sw3756b-ws97-l-0068)
and he when he got outside he noticed his receipt was like thirteen ninety nine or something (sw3756b-ws97-l-0069)
and he saw (sw3756b-ws97-l-0070)
i guess yeah (sw3756b-ws97-l-0071)
it was like over two hundred dollars worth of free stuff (sw3756b-ws97-l-0072)
yeah (sw3756b-ws97-l-0073)
rollers are so messy (sw3756b-ws97-l-0074)
we (sw3756b-ws97-l-0075)
well the [topic's] about government (sw3942a-ws97-l-0001)
[%hesitation] i'm not altogether sure that that's my best topic [%hesitation] (sw3942a-ws97-l-0002)
yeah (sw3942a-ws97-l-0003)
[uhhuh] (sw3942a-ws97-l-0004)
[uhhuh] (sw3942a-ws97-l-0005)
yeah (sw3942a-ws97-l-0008)
i i i think that the last [%hesitation] part of that question was particularly interesting [%hesitation] about [%hesitation] [%hesitation] [%hesitation] can all [unethical] behavior or how much [unethical] behavior can be made illegal [%hesitation] because it it seems to me that when [%hesitation] government or public service of any kind [degenerates] so much that you have to have so many [explicit] ethical codes [%hesitation] [parallel] to the legal codes that [%hesitation] we're focusing on the wrong thing (sw3942a-ws97-l-0009)
maybe maybe that's what is happening (sw3942a-ws97-l-0010)
maybe so many things have become public with the media over the past you know ten to twenty years that [%hesitation] it becomes more evident (sw3942a-ws97-l-0011)
perhaps things that we didn't think of before and just concentrated on the [lawmaking] or the results that would be seen in public works or bills that are passed or you know et cetera like that (sw3942a-ws97-l-0012)
and we were just not exposed to the personal lives of these persons (sw3942a-ws97-l-0013)
and i couldn't help thinking when that last [{] [{] [qu-] [/] [@] [}] [/] [@] [}] it was a funny question when that last part of the question came about how many things can we [%hesitation] actually put a legal code on that [%hesitation] how much [%hesitation] should it be our [%hesitation] [prerogative] to see into the private lives of these people (sw3942a-ws97-l-0014)
that's right (sw3942a-ws97-l-0016)
yeah (sw3942a-ws97-l-0017)
[uhhuh] (sw3942a-ws97-l-0018)
i i i agree with that and [%hesitation] and also that if the results that they're putting out and what they actually seem to be [accomplishing] by legitimate means is what's you know going to the public then [%hesitation] then they'll pay for their private life in their own private conscience (sw3942a-ws97-l-0020)
and [%hesitation] [%hesitation] you know when it becomes public though it becomes scandalous (sw3942a-ws97-l-0021)
that's that's the thing that (sw3942a-ws97-l-0022)
[%hesitation] things that you don't know [%hesitation] do do not worm their way around and influence other people or perhaps lead other people [astray] (sw3942a-ws97-l-0023)
people could say oh they do it (sw3942a-ws97-l-0024)
so i guess you know (sw3942a-ws97-l-0025)
but as soon as things do get public [%hesitation] [{] [{] [ther-] [/] [@] [}] [/] [@] [}] there is that terrible concern (sw3942a-ws97-l-0026)
so sometimes i ask myself what are [%hesitation] people doing that are in the media when somebody you know comes up to office (sw3942a-ws97-l-0027)
it seems that one of the first thing that's done is to dig up any kind of a thing they can on them and get it all over the headlines (sw3942a-ws97-l-0028)
it's a very low way of living (sw3942a-ws97-l-0029)
[%hesitation] so (sw3942a-ws97-l-0030)
and and and and as far as [%hesitation] you know myself having any particular personal [%hesitation] knowledge or insight into politics or politicians it i'm not terribly involved in it (sw3942a-ws97-l-0031)
just in a very [cursory] way (sw3942a-ws97-l-0032)
i vote (sw3942a-ws97-l-0033)
and i you know try to do whatever i can on the little local area (sw3942a-ws97-l-0034)
but i i it just is not one of the things that i have [%hesitation] placed [%hesitation] [%hesitation] a lot of my particular time and effort into (sw3942a-ws97-l-0035)
so i i always feel very outside this kind of [%hesitation] this kind of an issue (sw3942a-ws97-l-0036)
yeah (sw3942a-ws97-l-0038)
[uhhuh] (sw3942a-ws97-l-0039)
yeah (sw3942a-ws97-l-0040)
right (sw3942a-ws97-l-0041)
[%hesitation] (sw3942a-ws97-l-0044)
i'm not i'm not in there (sw3942a-ws97-l-0045)
i'm not one of those [%hesitation] you know volunteers that's down at headquarters and whatever [%hesitation] although i admire the people that do that (sw3942a-ws97-l-0046)
and they certainly do get inside information (sw3942a-ws97-l-0047)
and [%hesitation] of course the better you know a person that might be affiliated with that kind thing the more you can trust their their judgment and their insight (sw3942a-ws97-l-0048)
but the media insight as you said (sw3942a-ws97-l-0049)
i just kind of read and kind of be aware (sw3942a-ws97-l-0050)
and then [%hesitation] i don't like to make a whole lot of [%hesitation] judgment [{] [{] [m-] [/] [@] [}] [/] [@] [}] myself unless (sw3942a-ws97-l-0051)
i thought it was kind of a strange topic about corruption in the government and [%hesitation] how many people are self serving (sw3942b-ws97-l-0001)
i mean you i i think people tend to think that the government is not corrupt and that people aren't self serving (sw3942b-ws97-l-0002)
i mean that's what i would like to think (sw3942b-ws97-l-0003)
[uhhuh] (sw3942b-ws97-l-0004)
[uhhuh] (sw3942b-ws97-l-0005)
[uhhuh] (sw3942b-ws97-l-0006)
yeah (sw3942b-ws97-l-0007)
right (sw3942b-ws97-l-0008)
[uhhuh] (sw3942b-ws97-l-0010)
that makes sense (sw3942b-ws97-l-0015)
because you start [prying] in people's private lives you ruin their lives as well as (sw3942b-ws97-l-0016)
and sometimes you know i don't even know how much of a difference it really makes you know (sw3942b-ws97-l-0017)
i mean i guess in some cases sure we care about what they did in the past (sw3942b-ws97-l-0018)
but [%hesitation] sometimes i don't know (sw3942b-ws97-l-0019)
it i think it gets in the way of the better judgment (sw3942b-ws97-l-0020)
i mean just because you did something in the past doesn't mean he's not a good enough person to be a politician (sw3942b-ws97-l-0021)
[%hesitation] (sw3942b-ws97-l-0030)
yeah (sw3942b-ws97-l-0032)
oh yeah (sw3942b-ws97-l-0033)
i guess it's what sells newspapers you know (sw3942b-ws97-l-0034)
yeah (sw3942b-ws97-l-0038)
i'm kind of the same way (sw3942b-ws97-l-0041)
i just kind of read the paper follow up on [{] [{] [peop-] [/] [@] [}] [/] [@] [}] i mean just you know keep an eye on what's going on (sw3942b-ws97-l-0042)
but i don't really play an active role in any kind of politics (sw3942b-ws97-l-0043)
right (sw3942b-ws97-l-0045)
right (sw3942b-ws97-l-0046)
no (sw3994a-ws97-l-0002)
i don't play any (sw3994a-ws97-l-0003)
i used to (sw3994a-ws97-l-0004)
i think everybody took piano lessons (sw3994a-ws97-l-0005)
so (sw3994a-ws97-l-0006)
do you (sw3994a-ws97-l-0008)
i started (sw3994a-ws97-l-0009)

and i played it for maybe three months (sw3994a-ws97-l-0011)
wow (sw3994a-ws97-l-0012)

true (sw3994a-ws97-l-0016)
only for about three months (sw3994a-ws97-l-0018)
yeah (sw3994a-ws97-l-0019)
me and my brother both took the classes (sw3994a-ws97-l-0020)
and we got pretty bored quick (sw3994a-ws97-l-0021)
[re] well i could play [%hesitation] the wood chuck song (sw3994a-ws97-l-0022)
and i still can to this date (sw3994a-ws97-l-0023)

yep they went out and bought us a piano (sw3994a-ws97-l-0027)
and for three months (sw3994a-ws97-l-0028)
oh yeah (sw3994a-ws97-l-0030)

yeah (sw3994a-ws97-l-0042)
i tried out for choir when i was think in the seventh grade (sw3994a-ws97-l-0043)
and they wouldn't let me in (sw3994a-ws97-l-0044)
so i never tried again (sw3994a-ws97-l-0045)
yeah (sw3994a-ws97-l-0047)
i never really learned the music or anything (sw3994a-ws97-l-0049)
i never learned (sw3994a-ws97-l-0050)
i got right to where i was figuring out where all the keys were on the piano (sw3994a-ws97-l-0051)
and that's about when i quit (sw3994a-ws97-l-0052)
yeah (sw3994a-ws97-l-0053)
yeah (sw3994a-ws97-l-0055)

[{] [{] [i-] [/] [@] [}] [/] [@] [}] i enjoy the music (sw3994b-ws97-l-0018)
it gives me an out (sw3994b-ws97-l-0019)
and it always sounds like (sw3994b-ws97-l-0020)
for my playing the piano when i was depressed and didn't have anything else to do and there was no one to play with i could always go play with the piano you know (sw3994b-ws97-l-0021)
so how long did you play (sw3994b-ws97-l-0023)
three months (sw3994b-ws97-l-0024)
i was going to say you you you got as far as the [%hesitation] chop sticks huh (sw3994b-ws97-l-0025)
oh the wood chuck song (sw3994b-ws97-l-0026)

oh bless your heart (sw3994b-ws97-l-0029)
did you ever did you ever just bang on it or do anything with it at all (sw3994b-ws97-l-0030)
oh okay (sw3994b-ws97-l-0031)
but i mean can you play anything on it other than the wood chuck song (sw3994b-ws97-l-0032)
no (sw3994b-ws97-l-0033)
okay (sw3994b-ws97-l-0034)
i can i [{] [{] [c-] [/] [@] [}] [/] [@] [}] i can still read music if i'm lucky (sw3994b-ws97-l-0035)
i (sw3994b-ws97-l-0036)
if i work real hard i can still barely read the music (sw3994b-ws97-l-0037)
but see i played the piano from the third grade all the way through high school (sw3994b-ws97-l-0038)
so (sw3994b-ws97-l-0039)
i played [{] [{] [chekirt-] [/] [@] [}] [/] [@] [}] [%hesitation] [concertos] and other stuff (sw3994b-ws97-l-0040)
but (sw3994b-ws97-l-0041)
i got to the point where i wasn't really reading music i was [memorizing] music (sw3994b-ws97-l-0042)
and so because of that i can't read music as well as i used to (sw3994b-ws97-l-0043)
but anyway (sw3994b-ws97-l-0044)
but i enjoy it though (sw3994b-ws97-l-0045)
i find it to be a good out (sw3994b-ws97-l-0046)
and i still enjoy the marching [{] [{] [ba-] [/] [@] [}] [/] [@] [}] (sw3994b-ws97-l-0047)
and i still enjoy [%hesitation] singing in the choir (sw3994b-ws97-l-0048)
so (sw3994b-ws97-l-0049)

yes (sw3994b-ws97-l-0052)

in fact that's about the only musical thing that i still do is sing in the choir (sw3994b-ws97-l-0055)
well i sing in the choir (sw3994b-ws97-l-0058)
i don't know if they want me to or not (sw3994b-ws97-l-0059)

that's pretty good (sw3994b-ws97-l-0061)
well (sw3994b-ws97-l-0062)
i was [{] [{] [a-] [/] [@] [}] [/] [@] [}] (sw3994b-ws97-l-0063)

and i wanted to be a high school band director (sw3994b-ws97-l-0065)
but after one semester of that i said no no (sw3994b-ws97-l-0066)

i enjoy it but not for profession no (sw3994b-ws97-l-0068)
and besides that i kind of could learn i wasn't really that good (sw3994b-ws97-l-0069)
