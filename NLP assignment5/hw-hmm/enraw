Administration
officials
insist
that
the
size
of
the
staff
was
n't
a
problem
during
the
Panama
crisis
.
###
But
one
clear
problem
during
the
coup
attempt
was
that
the
NSC
staffer
most
experienced
in
Latin
America
,
Everett
Briggs
,
was
gone
.
###
He
had
just
resigned
,
at
least
in
part
because
of
a
feud
with
Assistant
Secretary
of
State
Bernard
Aronson
over
the
administration
's
policy
on
Panama
and
support
for
Nicaragua
's
Contra
rebels
.
###
The
absence
of
Mr.
Briggs
underscored
the
possible
inadequacy
of
the
current
NSC
staff
.
###
Both
Gen.
Scowcroft
and
his
deputy
,
Robert
Gates
,
are
experts
in
U.S.-Soviet
affairs
.
###
Gen.
Scowcroft
is
particularly
well-versed
in
arms
control
,
and
Mr.
Gates
has
spent
years
studying
Soviet
politics
and
society
.
###
Both
have
become
confidants
of
President
Bush
.
###
But
neither
has
an
extensive
background
in
Latin
America
,
the
Middle
East
or
Asia
.
###
In
those
areas
,
the
role
of
NSC
staffers
under
them
therefore
have
become
more
important
.
###
Gen.
Scowcroft
knows
as
well
as
anyone
that
one
of
the
biggest
dangers
he
faces
is
that
NSC
staffers
working
in
relative
anonymity
will
take
over
policy-making
and
operational
tasks
that
are
best
left
to
bigger
and
more
experienced
State
Department
and
Pentagon
bureaus
.
###
But
just
as
every
previous
NSC
adviser
has
,
Gen.
Scowcroft
now
will
have
to
mull
at
what
point
the
NSC
staff
becomes
too
lean
and
too
restrained
.

A

Corp.
marketing
executive
,
admitting
his
role
in
the
Pentagon
procurement
scandal
,
pleaded
guilty
to
bribery
and
conspiracy
charges
for
helping
funnel
$
400,000
to
a
midlevel
Navy
acquisition
official
during
the
early
1980s
.
###
Frank
Lavelle
,
who
at
the
time
was
the
marketing
director
for
Sperry
in
Clearwater
,
Fla.
,
admitted
participating
in
a
scheme
to
bribe
Garland
Tomlin
,
the
Navy
official
.
###
Mr.
Tomlin
,
who
left
the
Navy
in
1985
,
pleaded
guilty
earlier
this
year
to
related
conspiracy
,
bribery
and
tax-evasion
charges
.
###
The
bribery
scheme
took
place
between
1982
and
1985
,
according
to
documents
filed
by
prosecutors
in
connection
with
Mr.
Lavelle
's
guilty
plea
in
federal
district
court
in
Alexandria
,

###
Sperry
merged
with
Burroughs
Corp.
to
become
Unisys
Corp.
in
late
1986
.
###
Court
documents
filed
by
prosecutors
indicate
Mr.
Tomlin
tried
to
steer
to
Sperry
a
multimillion
dollar
contract
to
computerize
maintenance
of
certain
Navy
electronics
equiment
.
###
Mr.
Tomlin
,
among
other
things
,
illegally
provided
Mr.
Lavelle
with
inside
information
and
documents
intended
to
give
Sperry
an
unfair
advantage
in
the
competition
,
the
documents
said
.
###
Sperry
ultimately
was
eliminated
from
the
competition
without
receiving
the
work
.
###
Documents
filed
by
prosecutors
also
indicate
that
Mr.
Lavelle
and
his
fellow
conspirators
requested
and
obtained
``
approval
of
the
scheme
''
from
more-senior
Sperry
officials
``
because
the
payment
which
-LCB-
Mr

requested

so
large

###
Bureaucrats
may
deserve
their
bad
reputation
,
after
all
.
###
Matthew
Lesko
,
something
of
a
professional
defender
of
government
,
thought
he
had
a
sure-fire
winner
last
summer
when
he
offered
$
5,000
for
the
best
``
verifiable
story
of
250
words
or
less
about
how
a
government
bureaucrat
helped
you
.
''
###
He
sent
out
thousands
of
news
releases
from
his
Kensington
,
Md.
,
office
.
###
He
plugged
the
contest
on
Larry
King
's
radio
show
,
on
Pat
Sajak
's
television
show
and
on
the
C-SPAN
cable
television
network
.
###
He
talked
about
it
in
every
speech
he
made
as
he
roamed
the
country
promoting
his
books
,
which
dispense
handy
how-to
advice
on
using
government
information
for
fun
and
profit
.
###
Mr.
Lesko
figured
he
would
be
flooded
with
entries
by
now
.
###
After
all
,
he
says
,
``
we
've
got
like
15
million
bureaucrats
.
''
###
And
in
addition
to
the
$
5,000
,
he
has
promised
the
winner
a
``
My
Favorite
Bureaucrat
''
plaque
and
offered
each
of
two
runners-up
$
500
.
###
So
far
,
though
,
Mr.
Lesko
has
received
only
one
entry
.
###
To
make
matters
worse
,
the
lone
nomination
came
from
another
bureaucrat
:
A
woman
from
the
New
York
State
Department
of
Taxation
and
Finance
who
nominated
her
boss
.
###
Mr.
Lesko
,
who
is
making
the
rules
as
he
goes
,
has
determined
that
bureaucrats
are
eligible
for
nomination
by
other
bureaucrats
.
###
But
he
says
he
would
prefer
to
get
nominations
from
rank-and-file
folks
.
###
He
admits
that
he
has
n't
had
much
luck
generating
free
publicity
for
his
contest
.
###
Newspapers
,
including
this
one
,
have
generally
ignored
his
news
releases
.
###
Talk
show
hosts
quickly
change
the
topic
.
###
But
Mr.
Lesko
's
staff
is
beginning
to
wonder
whether
there
is
n't
some
larger
phenomenon
foiling
the
contest
.
###
``
Is
the
government
not
helping
anybody
?
''
asks
Toni
Murray
,
an
assistant
to
Mr.
Lesko
.
###
Mr.
Lesko
himself
is
n't
yet
prepared
to
accept
that
explanation
.
###
``
People
hate
to
write
,
''
he
says
.
###
``
Maybe
people
do
n't
believe
I
want
to
give
this
money
away
.
''
###
Maybe
Americans
are
just
so
annoyed
with
government
that
they
are
n't
interested
in
admitting
that
bureaucrats
come
in
handy
once
in
a
while
.
###
If
he
sponsored
a
contest
on
how
a
bureaucrat
mishandled
something
,
Mr.
Lesko
admits
,
``
I
'd
get
5,000
entries
.
''
###
Now
there
's
an
idea
.
###
Ford
Motor
Co.
and
Saab-Scania
AB
of
Sweden
broke
off
talks
about
a
possible
alliance
after
Ford
officials
concluded
that
the
cost
to
modernize
Saab
's
car
operations
would
outweigh
the
likely
return
.
###
With
the
collapse
of
the
talks
Friday
,
European
analysts
expect
Ford
to
intensify
its
pursuit
of
British
luxury
car
maker
Jaguar
PLC
,
which
is
scrambling
to
fend
off
a
hostile
Ford
bid
by
negotiating
a
friendly
alliance
with
Ford
's
archrival
,
General
Motors
Corp
.
###
Saab
,
meanwhile
,
is
left
to
continue
its
search
for
an
ally
to
shore
up
its
sagging
car
business
.
###
Saab
said
last
week
it
``
has
had
and
will
continue
to
have
contacts
with
other
manufacturers
.
''
###
Among
the
possible
suitors
is
Italy
's
Fiat
S.p
.
A
,
analysts
said
last
week
.
###
Ford
and
Saab
officials
declined
to
elaborate
publicly
on
the
announcement
Friday
that
their
negotiations
failed
to
yield
an
agreement
``
that
could
make
long-term
business
sense
to
both
parties
.
''
###
Individuals
close
to
the
Ford
side
of
the
negotiations
said
late
last
week
that
the
No.
2
U.S.
auto
maker
lost
interest
as
it
became
clear
that
the
Swedish
auto
maker
's
automotive
operations
had
little
to
offer
in
the
way
of
image
or
technology
.
###
Ford
originally
had
seen
a
Saab
alliance
as
a
way
to
expand
its
presence
in
the
European
and
U.S.
luxury
car
markets
.
###
In
addition
,
Ford
and
Saab
had
discussed
a
possible
link
between
their
heavy
truck
operations
.
###
But
the
talks
on
a
heavy
truck
alliance
apparently
did
n't
go
far
.
###
Some
European
analysts
speculated
that
officials
of
Saab
's
highly
profitable
Scania
truck
operation
balked
at
surrendering
any
of
their
autonomy
.
###
Meanwhile
,
Ford
officials
became
convinced
they
could
n't
expect
to
recover
the
investment
it
would
require
to
make
Saab
's
cars
competitive
in
the
increasingly
crowded
luxury
market
.
###
Saab
's
problems
were
underscored
Friday
when
the
company
announced
that
its
car
division
had
a
1.2
billion
kronor
-LRB-
$
186.1
million
-RRB-
loss
during
the
first
eight
months
of
this
year
,
slightly
worse
than
Saab-Scania
had
forecast
in
its
first-half
report
last
month
.
###
Overall
,
Saab-Scania
's
pretax
profit
during
the
first
eight
months
of
the
year
plunged
48.9
%
to
1
billion
Swedish
kronor
-LRB-
$
155.1
million
-RRB-
from
1.96
billion
kronor
-LRB-
$
303.9
million
-RRB-
a
year
earlier
.
###
Industry
analysts
in
Europe
said
the
most
likely
suitor
for
Saab
now
is
Fiat
.
###
Saab
and
Fiat
have
worked
together
in
the
past
,
in
one
case
developing
jointly
a
new
auto
chassis
that
became
the
foundation
of
Saab
's
9000
model
,
Fiat
's
Croma
and
Lancia
's
Thema
.
###
Last
month
,
Saab-Scania
Chief
Executive
Georg
Karnsund
said
his
company
has
had
talks
with
Fiat
about
a
broader
alliance
.
###
But
the
talks
yielded
``
nothing
so
advanced
that
we
needed
to
make
a
public
announcement
about
it
,
''
he
said
.
###
As
for
Ford
,
analysts
expect
the
end
of
the
Saab
play
will
allow
the
U.S.
auto
maker
to
focus
its
resources
on
the
intensifying
struggle
with
GM
for
a
stake
in
Jaguar
.
###
The
failure
of
the
Saab
talks
``
makes
it
even
more
crucial
for
-LCB-
Ford
-RCB-
to
be
victorious
''
in
the
Jaguar
contest
,
said
Stephen
Reitman
,
European
auto
industry
analyst
at
UBS-Phillips
&
Drew
in
London
.
###
Ford
faces
an
uphill
fight
for
Jaguar
,
however
.
###
Jaguar
executives
said
last
week
they
expect
to
have
a
friendly
alliance
with
GM
wrapped
up
by
the
end
of
the
month
.
###
GM
,
meanwhile
,
is
hosting
a
delegation
of
members
of
the
British
Parliament
who
are
touring
the
auto
maker
's
headquarter
operations
in
Detroit
.
###
A
GM
spokesman
said
the
visit
is
n't
connected
to
the
Jaguar
situation
.
###
But
Ford
clearly
views
Jaguar
as
a
prize
worth
fighting
for
,
since
the
company
's
gilded
brand
image
would
give
Ford
a
badly
needed
leg
up
in
the
high
end
of
the
luxury
markets
in
both
Europe
and
the
U.S
.
###
Last
week
,
Ford
encountered
a
setback
in
its
effort
to
broaden
its
U.S.
luxury
offerings
when
it
was
forced
to
abandon
a
four-year-old
effort
to
market
its
German-built
Scorpio
sedan
in
the
U.S.
as
a
luxury
import
under
the
Merkur
brand
name
.
###
So
despite
the
GM-Jaguar
romance
,
analysts
say
Ford
by
last
Friday
had
boosted
its
Jaguar
holding
to
about
11
%
of
the
luxury
auto
maker
's
shares
outstanding
from
10.4
%
early
last
week
.
###
About
5.4
million
Jaguar
shares
changed
hands
in
active
trading
on
London
's
stock
exchange
Friday
,
and
Jaguar
shares
moved
up
19
pence
to
696
pence
-LRB-
$
11
-RRB-
.
###
On
the
U.S.
over-the-counter
market
,
Jaguar
's
American
depositary
receipts
rose
12.5
cents
to
$
11.125

The
Dallas
Cowboys
are
looking
at
a
long-yardage
situation
,
struggling
to
pull
ahead
of
the
Atlanta
Falcons
.
###
Up
in
his
stadium
box
,
their
new
and
controversial
owner
,
Jerral
``
Jerry
''
Jones
,
watches
anxiously
as
the
team
bounds
up
to
the
scrimmage
line
.
###
Mr.
Jones
takes
heart
.
###
There
in
the
center
of
the
pack
is
quarterback
Troy
Aikman
,
the
key
to
the
Cowboys
'
comeback
strategy
.
###
So
key
,
in
fact
,
that
Mr.
Jones
signed
him
in
April
for
$
11.4
million
over
the
next
six
years
--
a
record
for
a
rookie
.
###
``
He
's
a
genuine
Wheaties-box
athlete
,
''
gushes
Mr.
Jones
.
###
With
three
minutes
left
on
the
clock
,
Mr.
Aikman
takes
the
snap
,
steps
back
and
fires
a
21-yard
pass
--
straight
into
the
hands
of
an
Atlanta
defensive
back
.
###
The
crowd
groans
,
Mr.
Jones
shakes
his
head
,
the
Cowboys
lose
the
game
.
###
A
few
days
after
that
Sept.
17
game
,
Mr.
Aikman
broke
a
finger
,
sidelining
him
for
weeks
.
###
Ah
,
the
glamour
of
professional
sports
.
###
For
Mr.
Jones
,
losing
his
quarterback
temporarily
was
just
the
latest
in
a
string
of
setbacks
that
has
beset
the
Dallas
Cowboys
--
and
,
this
year
,
much
of
the
National
Football
League
.
###
Once
fat
and
happy
,
the
Cowboys
now
are
losing
games
,
fans
and
money
.
###
Last
year
,
the
team
ended
up
$
2
million
in
the
red
on
$
30
million
in
revenue
.
###
It
has
some
of
the
highest
costs
in
the
league
.
###
Its
attendance
is
off
23
%
from
six
years
ago
.
###
At
the
very
least
,
Mr.
Jones
,
who
cultivates
the
society
circuit
as
eagerly
as
his
bench
,
can
take
comfort
in
one
fact
:
These
days
,
he
is
n't
alone
.
###
Nearly
half
the
owners
of
the
28
National
Football
League
teams
are
losing
money
,
the
result
of
flat
attendance
,
aging
stadiums
and
--
more
than
anything
--
skyrocketing
salaries
for
star
players
like
Mr.
Aikman
.
###
Last
year
,
the
top
12
players
on
each
NFL
team
took
home
an
average
$
536,000
,
a
figure
comparable
to
baseball
and
higher
than
in
basketball
.
###
First-round
draft
picks
have
done
even
better
:
Average
salaries
and
bonuses
for
them
rose
to
$
685,000
this
year
,
up
44
%
from
1987
.
###
``
It
's
a
vicious
circle
,
''
says
Art
Modell
,
owner
of
the
Cleveland
Browns
.
###
``
One
team
pays
so
much
and
the
other
pays
more
.
###
We
just
do
n't
have
that
kind
of
income
stream
.
''
###
All
this
is
causing
convulsions
in
professional
football
.
###
Owners
,
largely
complacent
in
the
past
,
are
now
almost
desperately
looking
for
ways
to
lower
costs
and
raise
revenue
--
embracing
some
revolutionary
ideas
in
the
process
.
###
Though
not
intentionally
,
the
Cowboys
'
Mr.
Jones
has
come
to
represent
this
new
breed
of
owner
.
###
Shortly
after
buying
66
%
of
the
team
from
H.R.
``
Bum
''
Bright
for
$
145
million
,
and
mindful
of
the
Cowboys
'
ragged
bottom
line
,
the
47-year-old
Mr.
Jones
set
about
his
own
round
of
team
cuts
.
###
First
,
he
unceremoniously
sacked
Tom
Landry
,
the
legendary
coach
who
took
the
Cowboys
to
five
Super
Bowls
and
20
consecutive
winning
seasons
.
###
In
Dallas
,
Mr.
Landry
has
a
standing
just
shy
of
sainthood
.
###
Anti-Jones
sentiment
flooded
the
local
press
:
``
A
crude
obnoxious
hick
,
''
said
one
writer
;
``
a
real
oink
,
''
said
another
;
``
Who
in
the
hell
does
he
think
he
is
?
''
wrote
a
third
.
###
For
Mr.
Jones
,
it
was
just
the
beginning
.
###
He
quickly
cut
the
team
's
bloated
administrative
staff
by
half
,
shut
down
a
Cowboys-owned
dance
academy
and
,
in
July
,
announced
plans
to
sell
Valley
Ranch
,
the
team
's
30-acre
practice
camp
and
the
most
lavish
training
facility
in
the
NFL
.
###
Mr.
Jones
calls
the
ranch
``
the
Pentagon
of
Sportdom
.
''
###
It
is
a
maze
of
halls
that
connects
film
rooms
,
elaborate
spas
and
weight-training
centers
that
testify
to
a
richer
,
more
free-spending
era
.
###
He
likes
to
tell
the
yarn
of
how
he
got
lost
on
the
expansive
ranch
during
an
early
visit
,
took
refuge
in
an
office
and
called
the
front
desk
for
help
.
###
``
I
said
,
`
Somebody
come
get
me
.
###
I
'm
at
extension
29
.
'
''
###
With
a
new
day
dawning
on
the
sport
,
Mr.
Jones
does
n't
see
a
place
for
this
sort
of
luxury
.
###
``
It
's
just
not
cost
efficient
,
''
he
says
.
###
The
place
costs
nearly
$
2
million
a
year
to
maintain
.
###
When
he
sells
it
,
he
says
,
the
Cowboys
will
move
to
a
more
practical
--
read
affordable
--
grass
practice
field
near
Texas
Stadium
.
###
And
as
for
Tom
Landry
,
well
,
in
Mr.
Jones
's
mind
,
he
had
played
out
his
winning
years
.
###
After
posting
losing
seasons
in
each
of
the
last
three
years
,
the
Cowboys
needed
a
change
,
he
says
.
###
Football
has
long
been
Mr.
Jones
's
passion
,
both
on
and
off
the
field
.
###
An
Arkansas
native
,
he
started
at
guard
on
the
undefeated
1964
University
of
Arkansas
team
that
won
a
national
championship
.
###
After
college
,
he
worked
at
his
father
's
insurance
company
in
Little
Rock
,
and
in
1966
led
an
aborted
attempt
to
buy
the
San
Diego
Chargers
.
###
Years
later
,
with
cash
from
the
sale
of
the
insurance
company
,
he
founded
Arkoma
Production
Corp.
,
an
oil
and
gas
exploration
company
based
in
Little
Rock
.
###
So
it
was
n't
surprising
that
Mr.
Jones
returned
to
his
Arkansas
roots
when
he
went
looking
for
a
replacement
for
Mr.
Landry
.
###
He
tapped
Jimmy
Johnson
,
a
teammate
on
the
1964
University
of
Arkansas
squad
and
the
head
coach
at
the
University
of
Miami
,
where
he
led
the
Hurricanes
to
five
winning
seasons
and
a
national
championship
in
1987
.
###
Whatever
Mr.
Johnson
's
talents
,
in
the
hearts
and
minds
of
many
Dallas
fans
,
he
is
no
Tom
Landry
.
###
Seven
games
-LRB-
and
,
after
a
loss
to
the
Kansas
City
Chiefs
yesterday
,
seven
losses
-RRB-
into
the
season
,
the
``
new
''
Cowboys
are
n't
doing
any
better
than
the
old
.
###
In
fact
,
the
last
time
they
played
this
badly
was
in
1960
,
their
opening
season
.
###
Average
attendance
at
their
games
,
about
49,000
last
year
,
continues
flat
.
###
Mr.
Jones
is
attacking
the
problem
on
several
fronts
.
###
He
continues
to
reshuffle
the
team
,
trading
famed
running
back
Herschel
Walker
to
the
Minnesota
Vikings
this
month
for
a
slew
of
players
and
future
draft
picks
.
###
To
try
to
draw
more
fans
,
he
has
dropped
end-zone
ticket
prices
from
$
25
to
$
19
.
###
But
the
general
trend
,
given
rising
costs
in
the
league
,
has
been
to
raise
prices
,
and
Mr.
Jones
is
expected
to
eventually
follow
suit
.
###
``
It
's
simple
,
''
says
Lamar
Hunt
,
who
owns
the
Kansas
City
Chiefs
and
last
year
raised
ticket
prices
by
$
2.40
to
an
average
$
17
.
###
If
we
did
n't
increase
prices
,
we
'd
be
in
the
red
.
''
###
Mr.
Jones
has
also
beefed
up
his
marketing
staff
to
sell
the
118
luxury
suites
topping
Texas
Stadium
-LRB-
his
deal
with
Bum
Bright
included
operating
rights
for
the
stadium
-RRB-
.
###
The
suites
are
air-conditioned
,
have
wet
bars
and
plush
seating
,
and
offer
a
clear
view
of
the
field
--
all
for
a
sale
price
of
$
475,000
to
$
1
million
,
depending
on
their
size
and
location
.
###
Mr.
Jones
has
been
taking
prospective
suite
owners
onto
the
field
during
practice
to
let
them
rub
elbows
with
players
,
and
promises
those
who
actually
buy
one
of
the
rooms
an
insider
's
look
at
the
team
's
strategy
before
game
time
.
###
The
sales
job
seems
to
be
paying
off
:
When
he
bought
the
team
,
only
six
of
the
suites
had
been
sold
.
###
Today
,
30
have
.
###
Gate
receipts
are
only
the
Cowboys
'
second
largest
source
of
cash
.
###
The
biggest
is
the
NFL
's
contract
with
national
television
for
broadcast
of
the
league
's
games
.
###
Last
year
,
the
Cowboys
'
share
of
that
pie
came
to
$
17.6
million
.
###
The
team
additionally
earns
between
$
2
million
and
$
4
million
for
local
radio
and
television
broadcast
rights
.
###
Mr.
Jones
is
currently
trying
to
jack
up
the
price
for
those
local
rights
.
###
He
is
also
trying
to
get
more
stations
in
Mexico
,
where
the
Cowboys
have
a
following
,
to
pick
up
the
games
.
###
Mr.
Jones
,
whose
twangy
voice
and
folksy
ways
belie
an
intense
businessman
who
works
16-hour
days
,
is
resigned
to
the
hefty
salaries
he
pays
his
players
these
days
.
###
He
calls
the
contracts
``
critical
to
winning
in
the
NFL
''
and
has
played
his
part
in
the
bidding
wars
.
###
Besides
signing
Mr.
Aikman
to
a
sizable
contract
,
Mr.
Jones
has
agreed
to
pay
rookie
quarterback
Steve
Walsh
$
4.1
million
over
the
next
four
years
.
###
This
wage
inflation
is
bleeding
the
NFL
dry
,
the
owners
contend
.
###
Soon
,
only
large
corporations
will
be
able
to
afford
to
buy
and
run
football
teams
,
predicts
John
J.
Veatch
Jr.
,
an
investment
banker
with
Salomon
Brothers
who
handled
the
Cowboys
sale
.
###
To
tackle
the
problem
,
NFL
owners
have
proposed
setting
a
rookie
wage
scale
to
try
to
rein
in
salaries
.
###
Details
of
the
plan
,
which
would
go
into
effect
in
1993
,
are
sketchy
,
but
each
player
would
apparently
be
paid
a
base
salary
keyed
to
his
position
and
ability
.
###
Bonuses
would
be
paid
based
on
playing
time
and
performance
.
###
The
NFL
Players
Association
,
meanwhile
,
contends
that
athletes
are
paid
a
wage
commensurate
with
their
ability
to
draw
fans
,
and
that
some
owners
are
in
financial
trouble
because
of
poor
business
management
,
not
players
'
salaries
.
###
The
owners
are
trying
to
boost
profit
in
other
ways
,
too
.
###
Many
have
launched
promotions
to
attract
new
fans
and
are
renegotiating
dated
stadium
contracts
.
###
Most
of
the
owners
must
pay
up
to
10
%
of
gross
ticket
sales
for
leases
on
stadiums
they
say
are
either
too
small
or
too
old
.
###
In
Chicago
,
for
example
,
size
is
the
issue
.
###
``
We
have
the
worst
lease
in
the
NFL
,
''
contends
Michael
B.
McCaskey
,
the
president
of
the
Chicago
Bears
and
a
grandson
of
George
Halas
,
who
founded
the
NFL
's
predecessor
organization
.
###
``
We
're
in
a
metro
area
with
millions
of
Bear
fans
,
and
only
a
small
number
can
be
accommodated
.
''
###
When
the
lease
expires
in
1999
,
he
says
,
``
It
's
got
to
be
changed
.
''
###
This
year
,
the
NFL
also
imposed
an
80-player
limit
on
teams
going
into
training
camp
,
down
from
120
,
in
a
move
meant
to
trim
payroll
costs
.
###
And
the
league
is
trying
to
get
more
for
its
three-year
national
network
contract
,
which
expires
after
this
season
.
###
The
current
contract
pays
the
NFL
$
1.4
billion
.
###
Owners
say
they
expect
the
league
to
demand
a
50
%
increase
,
despite
the
fact
that
televised
football
games
have
had
lackluster
ratings
.
###
An
NFL
spokesman
also
says
the
league
will
probably
expand
its
offerings
to
cable
TV
companies
like
ESPN
.
###
The
changes
have
n't
come
easy
.
###
Like
the
game
of
professional
football
,
the
NFL
organization
itself
is
in
turmoil
.
###
The
new
breed
of
team
owner
,
Mr.
Jones
included
,
has
been
fighting
the
NFL
bureaucracy
for
a
greater
say
in
league
affairs
,
and
the
battle
has
produced
a
form
of
organizational
gridlock
.
###
In
July
,
11
NFL
owners
,
almost
all
of
them
new
,
blocked
an
effort
to
install
Jim
Finks
as
a
replacement
for
retiring
league
commissioner
Pete
Rozelle
.
###
Mr.
Finks
is
perceived
by
some
owners
as
a
standard-bearer
for
the
Old
Guard
.
###
Earlier
this
month
,
another
effort
to
choose
a
commissioner
failed
.
###
The
owners
meet
again
tomorrow
.
###
For
his
part
,
Jerry
Jones
says
he
's
in
the
business
for
the
long
haul
,
and
his
work
style
seems
to
support
that
.
###
He
puts
in
busy
six-day
weeks
-LRB-
excluding
game
days
-RRB-
,
and
on
one
recent
afternoon
fielded
questions
,
in
the
course
of
an
hour
,
from
a
TV
producer
,
his
luxury-suite
marketing
manager
,
a
disgruntled
customer
and
a
roomful
of
Arkansas
reporters
.
###
To
keep
his
schedule
on
track
,
he
flies
two
personal
secretaries
in
from
Little
Rock
to
augment
his
staff
in
Dallas
.
###
``
When
I
made
this
investment
,
I
made
it
on
a
lifetime
basis
,
''
he
explains
.
###
``
I
'm
not
here
to
make
money
by
reselling
the
team
later
on
.
###
While
the
Cowboys
may
not
be
the
best
investment
now
,
I
do
n't
accept
they
ca
n't
be
in
the
future
.
''
###
Besides
,
to
a
large
extent
,
Mr.
Jones
may
already
be
getting
what
he
wants
out
of
the
team
,
even
though
it
keeps
losing
.
###
Owning
the
Cowboys
has
bought
him
entree
to
a
glitzy
life
that
drilling
for
oil
in
Arkansas
just
did
n't
provide
.
###
There
is
the
new
private
jet
,
the
platoon
of
assistants
,
invitations
to
the
best
parties
,
and
television
appearances
on
shows
such
as
``
Prime
Time
Live
.
''
###
A
few
weeks
ago
,
Mr.
Jones
even
entertained
Elizabeth
Taylor
in
his
private
suite
at
Texas
Stadium
.
###
``
You
're
in
the
catbird
seat
every
day
in
this
job
,
''
he
says
.
###
How
interestingly
clever
of
Robert
Goldberg
to
use
the
form
of
pretend
advocacy
journalism
to
explain
his
perception
of
``
Days
of
Rage
''
in
his
television
critique
-LRB-
Leisure
&
Arts
,
Sept
11
-RRB-
.
###
He
chastises
Jo
Franklin-Trout
for
her
inept
presentation
of
advocacy
journalism
,
judging
her
project
as
``
intellectually
slipshod
.
''
###
Was
not
the
title
very
clear
?
###
One
example
he
gives
:
``
She
did
n't
ask
''
-LRB-
why
the
Palestinian
children
are
soldiers
throwing
stones
-RRB-
.
###
Really
now
,
did
she
have
to
ask
?
###
Were
not
the
pictures
and
happenings
,
which
have
been
continuing
news
headlines
,
answers
enough
?
###
Mr.
Goldberg
contends
that
even
as
``
propaganda
''
the
film
fails
because
it
presents
only
one
view
.
###
Of
course
the
Palestinians
complain
about
their
treatment
;
of
course
the
Israelis
feel
put
upon
.
###
But
his
complaint
that
``
Days
of
Rage
''
does
n't
contain
balanced
comments
from
Israelis
about
how
badly
the
Palestinians
are
behaving
is
irrelevant
.
###
It
's
like
doing
a
documentary
on
apartheid
and
insisting
that
equal
time
be
given
to
how
terrific
white
South
Africans
are
.
###
This
film
did
emphasize
how
long
the
stalemate
has
existed
by
tracing
the
conflict
to
the
days
of
World
War
I
when
the
British
tried
to
guarantee
both
a
Jewish
state
and
a
Palestinian
state
without
specifying
how
it
was
to
be
done
.
###
Well
,
``
Days
of
Rage
''
airing
with
before-and-after
packaging
,
and
after
repeated
delays
,
was
a
beginning
.
###
Every
issue
is
multisided
.
###
This
film
attempts
to
show
a
side
rarely
seen
in
our
media
.
###
Now
we
must
endure
a
rash
of
critics
who
apparently
wish
to
know
details
of
one
side
only
.

President
Bush
wants
the
Pentagon
to
get
special
treatment
in
coping
with
the
across-the-board
spending
cuts
that
took
effect
last
week
.
###
Mr.
Bush
asked
Congress
to
raise
to
$
6
billion
from
$
3
billion
the
amount
of
money
Defense
Secretary
Dick
Cheney
may
shift
among
the
Pentagon
's
individual
programs
,
projects
and
activities
,
allowing
him
to
ease
the
pain
that
the
Gramm-Rudman
budget
law
was
intended
to
inflict
.
###
If
the
request
is
approved
by
both
the
House
and
Senate
,
Mr.
Cheney
would
need
only
permission
from
the
White
House
Office
of
Management
and
Budget
to
move
the
money
,
according
to
Senate
budget
analysts
.
###
That
would
give
the
Pentagon
flexibility
that
no
other
federal
agency
has
.
###
``
It
's
simply
a
way
of
making
the
cuts
less
onerous
for
defense
than
they
are
for
domestic
programs
,
''
said
Chairman
James
Sasser
-LRB-
D.
,
Tenn
.
-RRB-
of
the
Senate
Budget
Committee
,
who
said
he
would
oppose
the
request
.
###
``
That
is
n't
consistent
with
the
kind
of
discipline
that
Gramm-Rudman
is
supposed
to
impose
,
''
he
said
.
###
The
president
's
request
did
n't
indicate
how
Mr.
Cheney
would
shift
the
money
.
###
A
Pentagon
official
said
the
request
was
made
to
give
the
department
``
maximum
flexibility
''
to
deal
with
the
cuts
.
###
Last
week
,
Budget
Director
Richard
Darman
structured
the
$
16.1
billion
spending
reduction
,
half
of
which
must
come
from
defense
,
to
``
impose
a
little
bit
more
discipline
''
by
applying
cuts
to
each
individual
program
,
project
or
activity
in
the
budget
.
###
That
would
give
agencies
``
less
ability...
to
fudge
over
things
,
''
he
told
reporters
.
###
Under
the
deficit-reduction
law
,
4.3
%
of
the
Pentagon
's
money
and
5.3
%
of
other
agencies
'
money
has
been
canceled
.
###
Lawmakers
are
expected
to
try
to
restore
the
funds
once
a
pending
deficit-cutting
measure
has
been
signed
into
law
.
###
Rochester

Corp.
said
it

Telephone
Corp.
,
of
Clintonville
,
Wis.
,
the
second-largest
unaffiliated
independent
telephone
company
in
that
state
.
###
Rochester
Telephone
said
the
acquisition
was
made
in
an
exchange
of
its
common
shares
for
all
the
shares
of
Urban
Telephone
,
but
a
price
was
n't
disclosed
.
###
Urban
is
the
company
's
first
telephone
subsidiary
in
Wisconsin
.
###
Since
June
,
Rochester
Telephone
signed
letters
of
intent
to
purchase
three
other
Wisconsin
firms
.
###
A
bill
that
would
permit
the
Securities
and
Exchange
Commission
to
monitor
the
financial
condition
of
securities
firms
'
holding
companies
is
facing
tough
opposition
from
some
Wall
Street
firms
,
which
argue
that
the
legislation
is
unnecessary
.
###
The
legislation
and
other
issues
related
to
the
stock
market
will
be
the
focus
of
hearings
this
week
by
the
House
Telecommunications
and
Finance
Subcommittee
and
the
Senate
Securities
Subcommittee
.
###
Richard
Breeden
,
the
new
chairman
of
the
SEC
,
has
n't
taken
a
formal
position
on
the
bill
,
which
would
also
require
investors
to
disclose
large
trades
and
give
the
SEC
additional
authority
during
market
emergencies
.
###
However
,
he
recently
told
the
Senate
Banking
Committee
that
he
believes
the
agency
should
have
explicit
authority
to
monitor
debt
levels
at
holding
companies
and
affiliates
of
broker-dealers
,
which
are
frequently
used
to
issue
bridge
loans
.
###
The
bridge
loans
are
intended
to
provide
temporary
financing
for
acquisitions
.
###
Since
such
loans
are
often
refinanced
through
the
sale
of
high-risk
,
high-yield
junk
bonds
,
the
recent
woes
of
the
junk-bond
market
have
renewed
concerns
among
regulators
about
the
risks
associated
with
Wall
Street
firms
issuing
bridge
loans
.
###
But
some
Wall
Street
executives
argue
that
such
fears
are
unwarranted
.
###
In
a
July
6
letter
to
the
Senate
Securities
Subcommittee
,
First
Boston
Corp.
argued
that
the
fact
that
no
retail
brokerage
firm
failed
during
the
1987
market
crash
demonstrates
that
current
rules
are
adequate
.
###
First
Boston
,
whose
holding
company
,
CS
First
Boston
Group
,
is
one
of
the
larger
issuers
of
bridge
loans
on
Wall
Street
,
said
it
is
also
concerned
that
once
the
SEC
has
the
power
to
monitor
holding
companies
,
it
will
try
to
regulate
their
activities
.
###
``
The
proposal
,
while
well-intended
,
I
think
can
be
dangerously
misleading
because
the
likely
consequence
would
be
to
weaken
,
rather
than
strengthen
the
control
the
SEC
has
exercised
for
50
years
over
the
financial
adequacy
and
viability
of
broker-dealers
,
''
Michael
Raoul-Duval
,
managing
director
of
First
Boston
,
said
in
an
interview
.
###
The
bill
would
``
divert
scarce
resources
of
the
commission
away
from
broker-dealers
into
areas
which
simply
have
no
way
of
affecting
broker-dealers
,
''
Mr.
Raoul-Duval
said
.
###
Sources
in
the
industry
and
on
Capitol
Hill
say
a
compromise
that
would
placate
the
industry
while
addressing
the
SEC
's
concerns
may
be
possible
.
###
An
aide
to
the
Senate
Securities
Subcommittee
says
some
legislators
support
the
concept
of
risk
disclosure
,
but
adds
:
``
nobody
is
wedded
to
the
language
in
the
bill
.
''
###
Edward
O'Brien
,
president
of
the
Securities
Industry
Association
,
said
that
the
securities-industry
trade
group
opposes
the
bill
as
it
is
written
but
that
it
is
``
hopeful
a
compromise
can
be
reached
to
achieve
the
SEC
's
goals
.
''
###
Mr.
O'Brien
will
elaborate
on
the
SIA
's
position
in
testimony
before
the
House
Telecommunications
and
Finance
Subcommittee
this
week
,
a
spokesman
said
.
###
This
letter
was
inspired
by
David
Asman
's
Sept.
25
editorial-page
article
about
Fidel
Castro
,
``
Man
in
the
Middle
of
Drug
Trafficking
.
''
###
I
've
organized
a
series
of
exchanges
,
exhibitions
and
other
continuing
projects
between
Cuban
and
American
artists
.
###
In
any
matters
between
us
and
the
Cubans
there
can
be
no
simplicity
,
consequently
I
've
become
familiar
not
only
with
Cuban
art
and
artists
,
but
also
with
Cuban
bureaucrats
and
their
counterparts
in
our
own
government
.
###
Despite
levels
of
obstruction
,
incompetence
and
ensuing
frustration
of
mythic
proportion
,
these
projects
all
remain
,
in
my
mind
,
valuable
and
well
worth
the
effort
.
###
There
is
a
simple
reason
for
this
:
the
Cuban
people
.
###
Let
me
immediately
put
limits
to
whatever
nostalgic
notions
that
may
intimate
.
###
Those
``
people
''
to
whom
I
refer
are
not
some
heroic
,
indecipherable
quantity
;
they
are
artists
,
critics
,
taxi
drivers
,
grandmothers
,
even
some
employees
of
the
Ministry
of
Culture
,
all
of
whom
share
a
deep
belief
in
the
original
principles
of
the
Cuban
Revolution
,
spelled
out
in
terms
such
as
equality
among
all
members
of
the
society
,
reverence
for
education
and
creative
expression
,
universal
rights
to
health
and
livelihood
,
housing
,
etc
.
###
In
fact
,
the
generation
of
painters
growing
into
maturity
right
now
works
with
such
profoundly
held
humanist
assumptions
and
such
passionate
commitment
to
moral
and
ethical
principles
that
it
makes
Che
Guevara
's
famous
linkages
of
art
idealism
and
revolution
seem
modest
.
###
It
is
on
behalf
of
these
people
,
and
out
of
my
real
respect
for
them
,
that
I
am
responding
to
Mr.
Asman
's
opinions
of
their
country
.
###
The
Ochoa
trial
in
July
,
with
its
revelations
of
deeply
rooted
and
widespread
corruption
,
and
the
summary
trial
and
execution
,
was
extremely
disturbing
to
everyone
who
has
ever
considered
himself
a
friend
of
Cuba
.
###
However
,
unacceptable
though
those
occurrences
may
have
been
,
they
still
provide
no
excuse
for
wholesale
departures
from
truth
.
###
Mr.
Asman
should
make
distinctions
among
Fidel
,
the
army
and
the
Cuban
people
.
###
They
are
not
interchangeable
,
since
they
are
motivated
to
act
based
on
their
own
circumstances
.
###
It
is
naivete
to
equate
a
government
's
policies
with
the
will
of
the
people
-LRB-
as
we
well
know
-RRB-
,
and
it
is
even
worse
folly
to
merge
the
clearly
divergent
agendas
of
Fidel
and
the
military
and
the
state
bureaucracy
.
###
Mr.
Asman
is
also
annoyed
that
Mr.
Castro
has
resisted
collaboration
with
U.S.
officials
,
even
though
by
his
own
account
that
collaboration
has
been
devised
essentially
as
a
mechanism
for
acts
directly
hostile
to
the
Cuban
regime
,
such
as
facilitating
defections
.
###
I
think
it
's
a
little
disingenuous
to
be
surprised
that
Fidel
does
n't
invite
the
U.S.
State
Department
to
violate
the
jurisdiction
of
the
Cuban
government
over
its
own
territory
.
###
We
badly
need
to
follow
fact
rather
than
the
rhetoric
of
conventional
wisdom
.
###
Without
this
basic
level
of
attention
to
reality
,
our
policies
on
Cuba
will
continue
to
be
as
counterproductive
as
they
have
for
30
years
.
###
From
my
own
point
of
view
,
given
the
qualities
of
humanity
,
creativity
and
warm
spirit
in
which
the
Cuban
people
excel
,
we
deny
ourselves
access
to
things
we
hold
dear
,
and
which
seem
to
run
in
such
short
supply
these
days
.
###
There
is
no
rational
justification
for
such
behavior
.

ENGRAPH
INC.
recently
reported
third-quarter
earnings
,
which
were
mistakenly
shown
in
the
Quarterly
Earnings
Surprises
table
in
last
Tuesday
's
edition
to
be
lower
than
the
average
of
analysts
'
estimates
.
###
Zacks
Investment
Research
did
n't
adjust
one
analyst
's
estimate
for
a
stock
split
,
which
therefore
was
artificially
high
.
###
Engraph
's
third-quarter
net
income
of
15
cents
a
share
actually
was
7
%
higher
than
the
adjusted
average
of
estimates
.
###
Investors
bailed
out
of
New
York
City
bonds
in
droves
last
week
,
driving
prices
lower
and
boosting
yields
.
###
One
bond
trader
estimated
that
more
than
$
50
million
of
New
York
City
general
obligation
bonds
were
put
up
for
sale
Friday
alone
.
###
While
that
represents
a
small
percentage
of
the
city
's
public
debt
outstanding
,
Friday
's
selling
followed
a
weeklong
effort
to
unload
the
bonds
by
a
broad
spectrum
of
institutional
and
individual
investors
.
###
``
I
've
never
seen
so
many
-LCB-
New
York
City
-RCB-
G.O.
's
up
for
sale
,
''
said
another
trader
.
###
``
Every
broker
has
blocks
of
every
size
and
maturity
.
''
###
Municipal
bond
analysts
said
the
sell-off
was
triggered
by
concerns
about
the
city
's
financial
health
,
rumors
of
a
$
900
million
bond
offering
coming
soon
,
and
political
uncertainty
.
###
A
spokesman
for
the
city
would
n't
confirm
the
size
of
the
bond
issue
,
but
did
say
that
a
general
obligation
offering
is
in
the
works
and
should
be
priced
sometime
in
the
next
two
weeks
,
before
the
November
mayoral
election
.
###
General
obligation
bonds
are
backed
by
the
city
's
overall
revenues
and
credit
.
-RRB-
###
Although
many
investors
were
aware
that
a
bond
offering
was
being
scheduled
,
many
expected
a
much
smaller
amount
of
bonds
to
be
sold
.
###
The
fact
that
the
city
will
issue
such
a
large
amount
of
debt
was
interpreted
as
a
sign
that
New
York
's
budgetary
problems
are
more
serious
than
had
been
expected
.
###
New
York
,
one
of
the
nation
's
largest
issuers
of
tax-exempt
bonds
,
sold
$
750
million
of
municipal
bonds
just
a
few
weeks
ago
.
###
There
have
been
reports
for
months
that
the
city
's
economy
is
weakening
,
as
the
October
1987
stock
market
crash
continues
to
make
itself
felt
.
###
The
recent
sharp
stock
market
decline
exacerbated
those
concerns
.
###
Meanwhile
,
tax
revenues
are
falling
while
the
city
's
spending
needs
are
expanding
.
###
Rumors
persisted
last
week
that
New
York
's
credit
ratings
--
single-A
from
Moody
's
Investors
Service
Inc.
and
single-A-minus
from
Standard
&
Poor
's
Corp.
--
are
at
risk
.
###
The
weakness
in
New
York
City
bonds
follows
a
warning
from
New
York
state
Comptroller
Edward
Regan
that
the
1987
crash
seriously
weakened
the
city
's
economy
.
###
In
a
study
,
the
comptroller
said
,
``
The
city
's
glory
days
are
over
.
''
###
Mr.
Regan
warned
mayoral
candidates
``
to
be
prepared
for
limited
options
and
constraints
on
service
increases
to
address
the
city
's
problems
in
the
next
few
years
,
due
to
the
now-evident
weakening
in
the
New
York
City
economy
.
''
###
New
York
City
's
revised
financial
plan
,
due
out
later
this
month
,
is
expected
to
include
measures
to
balance
the
city
's
$
27
billion
budget
.
###
At
present
,
analysts
project
a
budget
gap
on
the
order
of
$
500
million
to
$
600
million
for
the
fiscal
year
ending
June
30
,
1990
,
although
the
city
's
own
budget
analysts
project
a
narrower
deficit
.
###
Mark
Page
,
New
York
's
deputy
director
of
finance
,
said
that
investors
'
concerns
about
the
city
's
financial
health
are
``
unwarranted
given
our
proven
ability
to
manage
ourselves
.
''
###
He
charges
the
city
's
critics
with
spreading
``
unfounded
emotional
rhetoric
.
''
###
There
are
also
questions
about
whether
a
new
and
inexperienced
mayor
can
manage
the
city
through
what
could
become
a
financial
crisis
.
###
The
leading
contender
for
the
mayoral
office
,
Democrat
David
Dinkins
,
has
been
criticized
recently
for
the
way
he
handled
his
personal
financial
affairs
.
###
And
the
controversy
has
led
to
uncertainty
about
the
outcome
of
the
election
.
###
Until
last
week
,
Mr.
Dinkins
was
considered
a
shoo-in
.
###
``
The
market
can
adjust
to
good
news

but
uncertainty
drives

###
Until
last
week
,
``
Everyone
felt
certain
they
knew
the
outcome

the
election

###
Now
,
there
have
been
a
number
of
questions
raised
.
''
###
Last
week
,
yields
on
long-term
New
York
City
general
obligation
bonds
jumped
half
a
percentage
point

###
New
York
City
's
6
%

due
2018

for
example
,
were
quoted
late
Friday
at
a
price
to
yield
7.80
%
,
compared
with
7.60
%
Thursday
.
###
As
the
yield
on
New
York
general
obligation
bonds
rose
,
the
Bond
Buyer
20-bond
general
obligation
index
,
the
mostly
widely
followed
gauge
of
the
tax-exempt
market
,
held
steady
at
7.19
%
in
the
week
ended
Oct.
19
.
###
Qintex
Australia
Ltd.
encountered
another
setback
Friday
when
its
Los
Angeles-based
affiliate
,
Qintex
Entertainment
Inc.
,
filed
for
protection
under
Chapter
11
of
the
U.S.
Bankruptcy
Code

Qintex
Entertainment
also
said
David
Evans
,
its
president
and
chief
executive
,
and
Roger
Kimmel
,
a
director
,
both
resigned
.
###
Neither
could
be
reached
for
comment
.
###
Earlier
this
month
,
Qintex
Australia
's
$
1.5
billion
agreement
to
acquire
Communications
Co.
collapsed
because
of
a
dispute
over
a
$
50
million
letter
of
credit
the
Australian
operator
of
television
stations
and
resorts
was
to
have
supplied
as
security
in
the
transaction
.
###
Mr.
Evans
had
been
the
de
facto
head
of
for
months
.
###
Qintex
Entertainment
,
a
producer
and
distributor
of
television
programs
most
noted
for
its
co-production
of
the
hit
miniseries
``
Lonesome
Dove
,
''
said
it
filed
for
Chapter
11
protection
after
Qintex
Australia
failed
to
provide
it
with
$
5.9
million
owed
to
MCA
Inc.
in
connection
with
the
distribution
of
``
The
New
Leave
It
to
Beaver
Show
.
''
###
Qintex
Entertainment
is
43
%
owned
by
Qintex
Australia
and
said
it
relies
on
the
Australian
company
for
funding
its
working
capital
requirements
.
###
After
the
announcement
of
the
bankruptcy
filing
,
Qintex
Entertainment
stock
sank
$
2.625
in
over-the-counter
trading
to
close
at
$
1.50
on
heavy
volume
of
more
than
1.4
million
shares
.
###
The
stock
traded
as
high
as
$
10
this
past
summer
.
###
Jonathan
Lloyd
,
executive
vice
president
and
chief
financial
officer
of
Qintex
Entertainment
,
said
Qintex
Entertainment
was
forced
to
file
for
protection
to
avoid
going
into
default
under
its
agreement
with
MCA
.
###
The
$
5.9
million
payment
was
due
Oct.
1
and
the
deadline
for
default
was
Oct.
19
.
###
Mr.
Lloyd
said
if
Qintex
had
defaulted
it
could
have
been
required
to
repay
$
92
million
in
debt
under
its
loan
agreements
.
###
MCA
on
Friday
said
that
as
a
result
of
Qintex
's
failure
to
make
the
required
payment
it
was
terminating
the
distribution
agreement
on
``
The
New
Leave
It
to
Beaver
''
as
well
as
other
MCA
properties
.
###
Qintex
Australia
was
``
saying
as
recently
as
last
weekend
that
they
would
take

They
continued
to
represent
that
to
the
board

said
Mr.
Lloyd
.
###
``
We
were
reassured
they
would
stand
behind
the
company
.
''
###
Mr.
Lloyd
said
both
Qintex
Entertainment
and
Qintex
Australia
had
attempted
to
secure
a
loan
that
would
allow
the
company
to
make
the
$
5.9
million
payment
but
the
request
was
turned
down
by
an
unidentified

###
At
that
point
,
he
said
,
Qintex
Australia
stated
it
would
``
endeavor
to
arrange
''
the
financing
.
###
However
a
Qintex
Australia
spokesman
said
his
firm
had
never
``
promised
or
guaranteed
''
to
make
the
payment
.
###
In
a
prepared
statement
from
Australia
,
the
company
also
said
that
,
following
the
breakdown
of
the
MGM
talks
,
it
``
had
been
re-evaluating
its
position
as
a
significant
shareholder
and
a
substantial
creditor
of
Qintex
Entertainment
''
and
had
``
resolved
to
minimize
the
degree
of
further
loans
to
Qintex
Entertainment
in
excess
of
that
previously
made
.
''
###
The
Qintex
Australia
spokesman
added
that
his
company
had
opposed
the
Chapter
11
filing
.
###
He
said
the
company
believed
Qintex
Entertainment
's
financial
problems
could
have
been
resolved
by
other
means
.
###
The
report
of
the
bankruptcy
filing
stunned
Hollywood
executives
and
investors
.
###
``
It
's
a
shocker
,
''
said
Joseph
Di
Lillo
,
chairman
of
Drake
Capital
Securities
,
a
brokerage
firm
that
has
an
investment
in
Qintex
Entertainment
.
###
Qintex
Australia
was
``
going
to
pay
more
than
$
1
billion
for
and
then
they
could
n't
come
up
with
the
far
smaller
sum
of
$
5.9
million
.
''
###
Qintex
said
Mr.
Evans
,
the
former
president
,
resigned
for
``
personal
reasons
''
and
that
Mr.
Kimmel
,
an
attorney
,
resigned
because
his
participation
in
evaluating
the
company
's
role
in
buying
was
no
longer
necessary
.
###
Mr.
Kimmel
was
a
director
of
the
company
and
a
predecessor
firm
since
1980
.
###
The
announcement
seemed
to
further
damp
prospects
that
talks
between
Qintex
Australia
and
might
be
revived
.

It

which
made
two
failed

was
still
interested
.
###
However
,
``
we
are
n't
currently
doing
anything
.
###
It
is
n't
a
current

###
Japan
's
Finance
Ministry
strongly
denied
playing
any
role
in
the
New
York
stock-price
free
fall
.
###
Makoto
Utsumi
,
vice
minister
for
international
affairs
,
said
the
ministry
did
n't
in
any
way
suggest
to
Japanese
banks
that
they
stay
out
of
the
UAL
Corp.
leveraged
buy-out
.
###
The
ministry
has
never
even
suggested
that
Japanese
banks
be
cautious
about
leveraged
buy-outs
in
general
,
Mr.
Utsumi
said
.
###
``
There
are
no
facts
-LCB-
behind
the
assertions
-RCB-
that
we
sent
any
kind
of
signal
,
''
he
declared
in
an
interview
.
###
The
comments
were
the
ministry
's
first
detailed
public
statement
on
the
subject
,
and
reflect
the
ministry
's
concern
that
foreigners
will
think
Japan
is
using
its
tremendous
financial
power
to
control
events
in
foreign
markets
.
###
A
number
of
accounts
of
the
events
leading
to
the
190
point
drop
in
New
York
stock
prices
on
Oct.
13
accused
the
ministry
of
pulling
the
plug
on
the
UAL
deal
for
one
reason
or
another
.
###
Mr.
Utsumi
said
the
most
the
ministry
had
ever
done
was
ask
Japanese
banks
about
``
the
status
of
their
participation
''
in
one
previous
U.S.
leveraged
buy-out
.
###
The
ministry
inquired
about
that
deal
--
which
Mr.
Utsumi
declined
to
identify
--
because
the
large
presence
of
Japanese
banks
in
the
deal
was
``
being
strongly
criticized
in
the
U.S.
Congress
''
and
it
was
``
necessary
for
us
to
grasp
the
situation
.
''
###
He
said
the
inquiry
was
n't
made
in
a
way
that
the
banks
could
have
interpreted
as
either
encouraging
or
discouraging
participation
,
and
he
added
that
none
of
the
Japanese
banks
changed
their
posture
on
the
deal
as
a
result
of
the
inquiry
.
###
Mr.
Utsumi
also
said
some
Japanese
banks
were
willing
to
participate
in
the
UAL
financing
up
to
the
very
end
,
which
would
suggest
at
the
very
least
that
they
were
n't
under
orders
to
back
out
.
###
In
general
,
Mr.
Utsumi
said
,
Japanese
banks
are
becoming
more
``
independent
''
in
their
approach
to
overseas
deals
.
###
``
Each
Japanese
bank
has
its
own
judgment
on
the
profits
and
risks
in
that
-LCB-
UAL
-RCB-
deal
,
''
he
said
.
###
``
They
are
becoming
more
independent
.
###
It
's
a
sound
phenomenon
.
''
###
Sanwa
Bank
Ltd.
is
one
Japanese
bank
that
decided
not
to
participate
in
the
first
UAL
proposal
.
###
A
Sanwa
Bank
spokesman
denied
that
the
finance
ministry
played
any
part
in
the
bank
's
decision
.
###
``
We
made
our
own
decision
,
''
he
said
.
###
Still
,
Mr.
Utsumi
may
have
a
hard
time
convincing
market
analysts
who
have
rightly
or
wrongly
believed
that
the
ministry
played
a
role
in
orchestrating
recent
moves
by
Japanese
banks
.
###
All
week
there
has
been
much
speculation
in
financial
circles
in
Tokyo
and
abroad
about
the
ministry
's
real
position
.
###
Bank
analysts
say
ministry
officials
have
been
growing
increasingly
concerned
during
the
past
few
months
about
Japanese
banks
getting
in
over
their
heads
.
###
``
The
-LCB-
ministry
-RCB-
thinks
the
banks
do
n't
know
what
they
are
doing
,
that
they
have
very
little
idea
how
to
cope
with
risk
,
''
said
one
foreign
bank
analyst
who
asked
not
to
be
identified
.
###
``
The
-LCB-
ministry
-RCB-
wants
to
see
the
Japanese
banks
pull
in
their
horns
''
on
leveraged
buy-outs
,
he
added
.
###
Although
some
of
the
Japanese
banks
involved
in
the
first
proposed
bid
for
UAL
bowed
out
because
they
found
the
terms
unattractive
,
observers
here
say
they
have
a
hard
time
believing
that
commercial
considerations
were
the
only
reason
.
###
Japanese
banks
are
under
``
political
pressure
''
as
well
,
the
analyst
said
.
###
Moreover
,
analysts
point
out
that
Japanese
banks
have
a
reputation
for
doing
deals
that
are
n't
extremely
profitable
if
they
offer
the
chance
to
build
market
share
,
cement
an
important
business
relationship
or
curry
favor
with
powerful
bureaucrats
.
###
Clearly
,
some
financial
authorities
are
concerned
about
the
Japanese
banks
role
in
leveraged
buy-outs
.
###
At
a
news
conference
this
week
,
Bank
of
Japan
Gov.
Satoshi
Sumita
cautioned
banks
to
take
a
``
prudent
''
stance
regarding
highly
leveraged
deals
.
###
Despite
Mr.
Sumita
's
statements
,
it
is
the
Finance
Ministry
,
not
the
central
bank
,
that
makes
policy
decisions
.
###
While
recent
events
may
cool
some
of
the
leveraged
buy-out
fever
,
Japanese
banks
are
n't
likely
to
walk
away
from
the
game
.
###
Despite
the
risks
,
the
deals
can
be
an
attractive
way
for
Japanese
banks
to
increase
their
presence
in
the
U.S.
market
,
bank
analysts
say
.
###
Flush
with
cash
at
home
,
but
with
fewer
customers
to
lend
to
,
leading
banks
are
eager
to
expand
overseas
.
###
Jumping
in
on
big
deals
is
a
high
profile
way
to
leapfrog
the
problem
of
not
having
a
strong
retail-banking
network
.
###
France
's
national
tobacco
company
,
known
for
making
brown-tobacco
cigarettes
such
as
Gauloises
and
Gitanes
,
is
branching
out
.
###
Concerned
by
dipping
demand
for
its
traditional
products
,
it
is
moving
not
only
into
blonde
cigarettes
,
but
also
into
electronic
car-parking
payment
cards
to
be
sold
in
neighborhood
tobacco
stores
.
###
Brown
tobacco
in
France
is
a
more
pungent
,
stronger
grade
than
the
lighter
grade
,
or
blonde
tobacco
,
used
in
so-called
American-style
cigarettes
.
###
``
We
are
n't
Philip
Morris
Cos.
,
''
says
Bertrand
de
Galle
,
chairman
of
government-owned
Societe
Nationale
d'Exploitation
Industrielle
des
Tabacs
&
Allumettes
S.A.
,
known
as
Seita
.
###
He
says
that
because
Seita
's
profits
are
limited
by
government-controlled
cigarette
prices
,
he
does
n't
have
the
cash
to
diversify
as
heavily
into
food
and
drink
as
the
U.S.
concern
has
done
.
###
-LRB-
Last
year
,
for
example
,
Seita
's
net
profit
soared
150
%
to
461.6
million
French
francs
-LRB-
$
73.5
million
-RRB-
on
sales
of
FFr27.68
billion-a
1.7
%
profit
margin
.
-RRB-
###
Instead
,
he
said
in
an
interview
,
he
is
looking
for
ways
to
exploit
France
's
network
of
39,000
tobacco
agents
,
most
of
them
cafes
.
###
While
Seita
does
n't
own
the
French
tabacs
,
its
close
alliance
with
them
offers
distribution
possibilities
.
###
One
proposal
is
to
introduce
a
new
payment
system
for
parking
in
Paris
.
###
Instead
of
paying
for
parking
by
putting
money
in
the
existing
machines
,
which
deliver
little
paper
receipts
,
drivers
would
be
able
to
buy
electronic
cards
in
local
tobacco
shops
.
###
Once
activated
,
the
card
would
sit
in
the
car
's
window
,
showing
traffic
wardens
how
much
time
the
motorist
could
remain
.
###
When
the
motorist
returned
to
his
car
he
could
turn
the
card
off
and
,
if
it
showed
time
remaining
,
save
it
for
later
.
###
Seita
is
a
partner
in
the
project
,
which
was
developed
by
Matra
SA
using
Japanese
technology
.
###
Seita
and
Matra
currently
are
negotiating
with
city
officials
for
the
right
to
begin
service
.
###
And
Seita
is
considering
further
diversification
.
###
It
wanted
to
buy
RJR
Nabisco
Inc.
's
French
cracker
subsidiary
,
Belin
,
in
hopes
of
selling
its
products
in
tobacco
stores
,
but
lost
the
bidding
to
food
group
BSN
SA
.
###
It
currently
is
considering
bidding
for
Swedish
Match
Co
.
###
And
it
retains
an
interest
in
acquiring
candies
and
other
articles
that
might
be
sold
in
tobacco
shops
.
###
It
also
is
trying
to
shore
up
its
tobacco
business
.
###
Brown-tobacco
cigarettes
such
as
Gauloises
now
make
up
just
40
%
of
the
French
tobacco
market
,
half
the
level
of
about
two
decades
ago
.
###
While
Seita
retains
a
manufacturing
monopoly
in
France
,
it
is
being
hurt
by
rising
imports
and
from
waning
cigarette
demand
.
###
So
Seita
has
introduced
blonde
cigarettes
under
the
Gauloises
label
,
and
intends
to
relaunch
the
unsuccessful
Gitanes
Blondes
in
new
packaging
,
similar
to
the
slide-packs
used
by
brown-tobacco
Gitanes
.
###
The
aim
,
says
Mr.
de
Galle
,
is
to
win
market
share
from
imported
cigarettes
,
and
to
persuade
smokers
who
are
switching
to
blonde
cigarettes
to
keep
buying
French
.
###
When
the
Supreme
Court
upheld
Missouri
's
abortion
restrictions
last
July
,
the
justices
almost
certainly
did
n't
have
drunk
driving
,
trespassing
and
false
imprisonment
on
their
minds
.
###
But
the
5-4
ruling
may
have
had
as
much
immediate
impact
on
those
activities
--
especially
trespassing
--
as
on
abortion
rights
.
###
The
decision
,
Webster
vs.
Reproductive
Health
Services
,
illustrates
how
Supreme
Court
rulings
often
have
a
ripple
effect
,
spreading
into
areas
of
law
and
policy
that
were
n't
part
of
the
actual
cases
decided
and
that
never
were
contemplated
by
the
justices
.
###
In
the
Missouri
case
,
unforeseen
consequences
may
have
arisen
because
the
high
court
reinstated
the
preamble
of
the
state
's
1986
abortion
law
.
###
The
preamble
says
that
human
life
begins
at
conception
and
that
unborn
children
have
rights
protected
by
the
Constitution
.
###
Last
year
,
a
federal
appeals
court
in
St.
Louis
said
the
preamble
was
unconstitutional
,
citing
an
earlier
Supreme
Court
ruling
that
states
ca
n't
justify
stricter
abortion
curbs
by
changing
the
definition
of
when
life
begins
.
###
But
the
Supreme
Court
concluded
that
it
was
premature
to
rule
on
the
constitutionality
of
the
preamble
because
the
definition
of
human
life
had
n't
yet
been
used
to
restrict
abortion
services
.
###
The
high
court
majority
said
it
was
up
to
the
state
courts
for
now
to
decide
whether
the
definition
has
any
bearing
on
other
state
laws
.
###
Already
,
local
Missouri
judges
have
relied
on
the
restored
preamble
in
two
separate
cases
to
throw
out
criminal
trespass
charges
against
anti-abortion
demonstrators
who
blocked
access
to
Reproductive
Health
Services
,
an
abortion
clinic
in
St.
Louis
.
###
The
protesters
said
their
actions
were
justified
by
the
desire
to
save
the
lives
of
unborn
children
.
###
Under
a
1981
Missouri
law
,
persons
accused
of
some
crimes
,
including
trespassing
,
may
offer
a
defense
that
their
actions
were
justified
``
as
an
emergency
measure
to
avoid
an
imminent
public
or
private
injury
.
''
###
Relying
on
the
preamble
's
statement
that
a
fetus
is
an
unborn
child
,
the
two
St.
Louis
County
Circuit
Court
judges
in
August
accepted
the
justification
that
the
abortion
clinic
protesters
were
trying
to
save
lives
.
###
In
another
case
,
a
protester
,
Ann
O'Brien
,
was
convicted
of
trespass
before
the
Supreme
Court
's
Webster
ruling
.
###
Last
week
,
when
her
appeal
was
argued
before
the
Missouri
Court
of
Appeals
,
her
lawyer
also
relied
on
the
preamble
.
###
``
The
effect
of
the
Supreme
Court
Webster
opinion
is
that
it
left
room
for
grass
to
grow
in
the
cracks
of
Roe
vs.
Wade
,
and
I
think
this
is
one
of
the
cracks
,
''
said
Mark
Belz
,
a
St.
Louis
lawyer
who
represented
Ms.
O'Brien
and
the
other
St.
Louis
protesters
.
###
Roe
vs.
Wade
was
the
Supreme
Court
's
1973
decision
that
recognized
a
woman
's
right
to
abortion
.
###
Mario
Mandina
,
president
of
Kansas
City
Lawyers
for
Life
,
says
that
if
abortion
foes
succeed
in
using
the
preamble
to
escape
prosecution
for
trespass
,
``
This
will
shut
down
abortion
in
Missouri
.
###
There
's
no
risk
to
the
protesters
,
and
you
ca
n't
keep
an
abortion
clinic
open
if
there
are
3,000
people
standing
outside
every
day
.
''
###
That
would
be
an
ironic
result
of
a
case
in
which
the
Supreme
Court
expressly
stopped
short
of
overruling
Roe
vs.
Wade
.
###
In
two
other
cases
,
the
possible
consequences
of
the
Supreme
Court
ruling
appear
even
more
unintended
.
###
In
one
,
the
lawyer
for
a
20-year-old
resident
of
Columbia
,
Mo.
,
who
was
charged
with
drunk
driving
,
argued
that
his
client
should
be
treated
as
a
21-year-old
adult
because
his
actual
age
should
be
calculated
from
conception
,
not
from
birth
.
###
In
Missouri
,
those
caught
drinking
and
driving
between
the
ages
of
16
and
21
may
have
their
licenses
revoked
for
one
year
,
while
those
21
or
older
suffer
only
a
30-day
suspension
.
###
A
Boone
County
judge
rejected
the
motion
,
but
Daniel
Dodson
,
a
Jefferson
City
lawyer
,
says
he
has
appealed
.
###
And
in
a
case
filed
in
federal
court
in
August
,
a
lawyer
is
arguing
that
Missouri
authorities
are
wrongfully
imprisoning
the
fetus
of
a
pregnant
woman
who
is
in
jail
for
theft
and
forgery
.
###
In
terms
of
sheer
brutality
,
the
Somali
regime
of
Siad
Barre
may
rank
as
No.
1
in
the
world
.
###
The
only
reason
that
Somalia
remains
in
obscurity
is
numbers
:
a
sparsely
populated
wasteland
of
8.5
million
people
spread
out
over
an
expanse
nearly
the
size
of
Texas
.
###
The
Barre
dictatorship
simply
is
limited
in
the
amount
of
people
it
can
torture
and
kill
.
###
Beheading
small
children
,
stabbing
elderly
people
to
death
,
raping
and
shooting
women
,
and
burying
people
alive
are
just
a
few
of
the
grisly
activities
that
the
Somali
armed
forces
have
been
engaged
in
over
the
past
two
years
.
###
Up
to
500,000
Somalis
have
escaped
to
the
relative
safety
of
Marxist
Ethiopia
because
of
the
behavior
of
President
Barre
's
troops
.
###
In
the
port
of
Berbera
,
for
example
,
hundreds
of
men
of
the
rival
Issak
clan
were
rounded
up
in
May
1988
,
imprisoned
,
and
then
taken
out
at
night
in
groups
of
five
to
50
men
to
be
executed
without
any
judicial
process
whatsoever
.
###
Guns
were
never
used
:
Each
man
was
stabbed
to
death
with
a
large
knife
.
###
The
horrific
details
are
only
now
emerging
from
a
painstakingly
documented
report
,
based
on
hundreds
of
interviews
with
randomly
selected
refugees
.
###
The
study
was
done
by
Robert
Gersony
,
a
consultant
to
the
U.S.
State
Department
who
has
years
of
experience
in
investigating
human-rights
abuses
on
both
sides
of
the
left-right
ideological
divide
.
###
What
gives
these
events
particular
significance
,
however
,
is
the
fact
that
they
are
part
of
a
wider
drama
affecting
the
strategic
positions
of
both
the
U.S.
and
the
Soviet
Union
on
the
horn
of
Africa
.
###
Not
since
the
late
1970s
has
the
horn
been
so
up
for
grabs
as
it
has
suddenly
become
in
just
the
past
few
weeks
.
###
Mr.
Barre
's
rule
is
crumbling
fast
.
###
Mutinies
wrack
his
armed
forces
-LRB-
really
just
an
armed
gang
-RRB-
,
which
control
less
than
half
the
country
.
###
Inflation
is
at
record
levels
.
###
Desperate
,
he
has
called
in
the
Libyans
to
help
fight
the
rebels
of
the
Somali
National
Movement
in
the
north
,
which
is
only
one
of
several
groups
picking
away
at
the
regime
in
the
capital
of
Mogadishu
.
###
Seventy
years
old
and
a
self-declared
``
scientific
socialist
,
''
President
Barre
has
a
power
base
,
composed
only
of
his
minority
Mareham
clan
,
that
according
to
observers
is
``
narrowing
.
''
###
The
U.S.
's
interest
in
Somalia
consists
of
a
single
runway
at
the
port
of
Berbera
,
which
U.S.
military
aircraft
have
the
right
to
use
for
surveillance
of
the
Gulf
of
Aden
and
the
Indian
Ocean
.
###
That
strip
of
concrete
is
backed
up
by
a
few
one-story
,
air-conditioned
shacks
where
a
handful
of
American
nationals
--
buttressed
by
imported
food
,
cold
soft
drinks
and
back
issues
of
Sports
Illustrated
--
maintain
radio
contact
with
the
outside
world
.
###
In
the
past
two
years
,
the
desert
behind
them
has
become
a
land
of
mass
executions
and
utter
anarchy
,
where
,
due
to
Mr.
Barre
's
brutality
and
ineptitude
,
nobody
is
any
longer
in
control
.
###
As
long
as
the
rival
Soviet-backed
regime
of
Mengistu
Haile
Mariam
held
a
total
gridlock
over
neighboring
Ethiopia
,
the
U.S.
was
forced
to
accept
that
lonely
Berbera
runway
as
a
distant
No.
2
to
the
Soviets
'
array
of
airfields
next
door
.
###
But
due
to
dramatic
events
on
the
battlefield
over
the
past
few
days
and
weeks
,
those
Soviet
bases
may
soon
be
as
endangered
and
as
lonely
as
the
American
runway
.
###
On
Sept.
7
,
I
wrote
on
these
pages
about
the
killing
and
capturing
of
10,000
Ethiopian
soldiers
by
Eritrean
and
Tigrean
guerrillas
.
###
Recently
,
in
Wollo
province
in
the
center
of
Ethiopia
,
Tigrean
forces
have
killed
,
wounded
and
captured
an
additional
20,000
government
troops
.
###
-LRB-
Think
what
these
numbers
mean
--
considering
the
headline
space
devoted
to
hundreds
of
deaths
in
Lebanon
,
a
small
country
of
little
strategic
importance
-RRB-
###
Tigrean
armies
are
now
200
miles
north
of
Addis
Ababa
,
threatening
the
town
of
Dese
,
which
would
cut
off
Mr.
Mengistu
's
capital
from
the
port
of
Assab
,
through
which
all
fuel
and
other
supplies
reach
Addis
Ababa
.
###
As
a
result
,
Mr.
Mengistu
has
been
forced
to
transfer
thousands
of
troops
from
Eritrea
just
to
hold
the
town
,
thereby
risking
the
loss
of
even
more
territory
in
Eritrea
only
to
keep
the
Tigreans
at
bay
.
###
Mr.
Mengistu
is
in
an
increasingly
weak
position
:
Half
his
army
is
tied
down
defending
the
northern
city
of
Asmara
from
the
Eritreans
.
###
The
weaker
he
gets
,
the
more
he
turns
toward
the
U.S.
for
help
.
###
While
the
Tigreans
are
communists
,
like
the
Eritreans
they
are
among
the
most
anti-Soviet
guerrillas
in
the
world
,
having
suffered
more
than
a
decade
of
aerial
bombardment
by
the
Soviet-supplied
Mengistu
air
force
.
###
What
this
all
means
in
shorthand
is
that
Soviet
dominance
in
Ethiopia
is
collapsing
as
fast
as
President
Barre
's
regime
in
Somalia
is
.
###
The
U.S.
,
therefore
,
has
a
historic
opportunity
both
to
strike
a
blow
for
human
rights
in
Somalia
and
to
undo
the
superpower
flip-flop
of
the
late
1970s
on
the
Horn
of
Africa
.
###
Back
to
Somalia
:
The
State
Department
,
to
its
credit
,
has
already
begun
distancing
itself
from
Mr.
Barre
,
evinced
by
its
decision
to
publish
the
Gersony
report
-LRB-
which
the
press
has
ignored
-RRB-
###
What
's
more
,
the
U.S.
has
suspended
$
2.5
million
in
military
aid
and
$
1
million
in
economic
aid
.
###
But
this
is
not
enough
.
###
Because
the
U.S.
is
still
perceived
to
be
tied
to
Mr.
Barre
,
when
he
goes
the
runway
could
go
too
.
###
Considering
how
tenuous
the
security
of
that
runway
is
anyway
,
the
better
option
--
both
morally
and
strategically
--
would
be
for
the
Bush
administration
to
blast
the
regime
publicly
,
in
terms
clear
enough
for
all
influential
Somalis
to
understand
.
###
It
is
a
certainty
that
Mr.
Barre
's
days
are
numbered
.
###
The
U.S.
should
take
care
,
however
,
that
its
own
position
in
the
country
does
not
go
down
with
him
.
###
Nobody
is
sure
what
will
come
next
in
Somalia
or
whom
the
successor
might
be
.
###
But
as
one
expert
tells
me
:
``
Whoever
it
is
will
have
to
work
pretty
damn
hard
to
be
worse
than
Barre
.
''
###
While
the
State
Department
positions
itself
for
the
post-Barre
period
in
Somalia
,
it
should
continue
to
back
former
President
Carter
's
well-intentioned
role
as
a
mediator
between
Mr.
Mengistu
and
the
Eritrean
guerrillas
in
Ethiopia
,
while
concomitantly
opening
up
channels
of
communications
with
the
Tigrean
rebels
through
neighboring
Sudan
.
###
Ethiopian
politics
are
the
most
sophisticated
,
secretive
and
Byzantine
in
all
of
black
Africa
.
###
Remember
that
it
took
Mr.
Mengistu
many
months
,
in
what
became
known
as
the
``
creeping
coup
,
''
to
topple
Emperor
Haile
Selassie
in
1974
and
1975
.
###
There
is
simply
no
way
to
engineer
a
succession
covertly
,
as
is
sometimes
possible
elsewhere
on
the
continent
.
###
But
the
U.S.
has
one
great
advantage
:
The
Soviets
are
universally
loathed
throughout
Ethiopia
for
what
they
did
to
the
country
this
past
decade
--
famine
and
all
.
###
It
's
not
just
in
Eastern
Europe
where
the
march
of
events
is
finally
on
the
U.S.
side
,
but
on
the
horn
of
Africa
as
well
.
###
The
only
U.S.
liability
in
the
region
is
what
remains
of
the
link
to
Mr.
Barre
,
and
that
should
be
cut
fast
.

###
OPEC
's
ability
to
produce
more
petroleum
than
it
can
sell
is
beginning
to
cast
a
shadow
over
world
oil
markets
.
###
Output
from
the
Organization
of
Petroleum
Exporting
Countries
is
already
at
a
high
for
the
year
and
most
member
nations
are
running
flat
out
.
###
But
industry
and
OPEC
officials
agree
that
a
handful
of
members
still
have
enough
unused
capacity
to
glut
the
market
and
cause
an
oil-price
collapse
a
few
months
from
now
if
OPEC
does
n't
soon
adopt
a
new
quota
system
to
corral
its
chronic
cheaters
.
###
As
a
result
,
the
effort
by
some
oil
ministers
to
get
OPEC
to
approve
a
new
permanent
production-sharing
agreement
next
month
is
taking
on
increasing
urgency
.
###
The
organization
is
scheduled
to
meet
in
Vienna
beginning
Nov.
25
.
###
So
far
this
year
,
rising
demand
for
OPEC
oil
and
production
restraint
by
some
members
have
kept
prices
firm
despite
rampant
cheating
by
others
.
###
But
that
could
change
if
demand
for
OPEC
's
oil
softens
seasonally
early
next
year
as
some
think
may
happen
.
###
OPEC
is
currently
producing
more
than
22
million
barrels
a
day
,
sharply
above
its
nominal
,
self-imposed
fourth-quarter
ceiling
of
20.5
million
,
according
to
OPEC
and
industry
officials
at
an
oil
conference
here
sponsored
by
the
Oil
Daily
and
the
International
Herald
Tribune
.
###
At
that
rate
,
a
majority
of
OPEC
's
13
members
have
reached
their
output
limits
,
they
said
.
###
But
it
is
estimated
that
at
least
three
million
barrels
a
day
--
and
possibly
as
much
as
seven
million
barrels
a
day
--
of
spare
capacity
still
exists
within
OPEC
.
###
Most
is
concentrated
in
five
Persian
Gulf
countries
,
including
his
own
,
Issam
Al-Chalabi
,
Iraq
's
oil
minister
,
told
the
conference
Friday
.
###
He
puts
OPEC
's
current
capacity
at
28
million
to
29
million
barrels
a
day
.
###
That
's
higher
than
some
other
estimates
.
###
Ali
Khalifa
Al-Sabah
,
Kuwait
's
oil
minister
,
recently
estimated
OPEC
capacity
at
25
million
barrels
a
day
.
###
Either
way
,
the
overhang
is
big
enough
to
keep
delicately
balanced
oil
markets
on
edge
.
###
Even
modest
amounts
of
additional
output
by
those
with
the
huge
extra
capacity
and
reserves
,
such
as
Saudi
Arabia
and
Iraq
,
could
upset
the
market
.
###
The
Iraqi
oil
minister
and
Saudi
oil
minister
Hisham
Nazer
insisted
in
their
comments
to
the
conference
that
their
countries
would
act
responsibly
to
maintain
a
stable
market
.
###
However
,
in
interviews
later
,
both
ministers
stressed
that
they
expect
future
OPEC
quotas
to
be
based
mainly
on
the
production
capacity
and
reserves
of
each
member
.
###
Under
that
approach
,
countries
with
the
most
unused
oil
capacity
would
get
bigger
shares
of
any
future
increases
in
OPEC
's
production
ceiling
than
they
would
under
the
current
system
.
###
``
If
you
are
already
producing
at
95
%
or
100
%
of
your
capacity
,
what
's
the
good
to
be
told
you
can
produce
at
105
%
of
capacity
?
''
asked
Mr.
Al-Chalabi
.
###
At
an
inconclusive
Geneva
meeting
late
last
month
,
OPEC
's
oil
ministers
halfheartedly
approved
another
increase
of
one
million
barrels
a
day
in
their
production
ceiling
.
###
They
doled
it
out
using
the
existing
formula
,
however
,
which
meant
that
even
those
countries
that
could
n't
produce
more
received
higher
official
allotments
.
###
The
main
effect
of
the
ceiling
boost
was
to
``
legitimize
''
some
of
the
overproduction
already
coming
from
the
quota
cheaters
.
###
Still
,
there
was
a
breakthrough
at
Geneva
.
###
Previously
,
no
OPEC
member
had
been
willing
to
accept
a
reduction
in
its
percentage
share
of
the
group
's
total
output
target
,
or
ceiling
.
###
But
the
concept
of
disproportionate
quotas
for
those
with
unused
capacity
,
advanced
there
in
an
Iranian
proposal
,
was
generally
endorsed
by
the
ministers
.
###
In
the
end
politics
got
in
the
way
.
###
Libya
accepted
Iran
's
proposal
only
so
long
as
it
was
promised
production
parity
with
Kuwait
.
###
And
the
United
Arab
Emirates
,
a
chronic
quota
cheater
,
refused
to
give
any
guarantee
it
would
change
its
ways
.
###
But
the
oil
ministers
continue
to
study
the
plan
,
and
it
will
probably
be
the
basis
for
discussion
at
next
month
's
meeting
.
###
It
's
understood
several
compromises
already
have
been
worked
into
the
plan
.
###
The
ceiling
would
be
lifted
to
21.5
million
barrels
to
provide
Kuwait
and
the
United
Arab
Emirates
much
higher
official
quotas
while
reducing
percentage
shares
of
some
others
.
###
Libya
's
previous
conditions
are
no
longer
considered
a
problem
,
although
the
United
Arab
Emirates
is
still
an
issue
.
###
Saudi
Arabia
,
OPEC
's
kingpin
,
also
has
surfaced
as
a
possible
obstacle
,
some
OPEC
sources
said
.
###
Insisting
on
a
24.5
%
share
of
any
ceiling
,
Saudi
officials
have
long
pressed
for
the
pro
rata
distribution
of
increases
to
all
members
.
###
In
Geneva
,
however
,
they
supported
Iran
's
proposal
because
it
would
have
left
the
Saudi
percentage
of
the
OPEC
total
intact
,
and
increased
actual
Saudi
volume
to
nearly
5.3
million
barrels
daily
from
five
million
.
###
Some
of
the
proposed
modifications
since
,
however
,
call
on
Saudi
Arabia
to
``
give
back
''
to
the
production-sharing
pool
a
token
23,000
barrels
.
###
Though
tiny
,
that
's
a
reduction
in
its
share
.
###
Mr.
Nazer
,
the
Saudi
oil
minister
,
reiterated
here
that
the
kingdom
would
insist
on
maintaining
its
percentage
share
of
OPEC
production
under
any
quota
revisions
.
###
``
Under
any
circumstances
,
Saudi
Arabia
should
get
more
''
rather
than
less
,
Mr.
Nazer
said
.
###
In
a
blow
to
France
's
Rafale
jet
fighter
,
the
French
navy
for
the
first
time
publicly
stated
its
desire
to
buy
15
McDonnell
Douglas
Corp.
F-18
Hornets
to
defend
its
aircraft
carriers
.
###
The
statement
is
likely
to
sharpen
the
debate
within
France
's
military
establishment
over
the
Rafale
,
which
is
made
by
Avions
Marcel
Dassault-Breguet
Aviation
SA
.
###
In
an
interview
in
the
navy
's
official
weekly
magazine
Cols
Bleus
,
the
navy
's
second-in-command
,
Adm.
Yves
Goupil
,
said
the
navy
still
intends
to
buy
86
Rafales
as
scheduled
in
the
late
1990s
and
early
21st
century
.
###
The
air
force
is
to
take
at
least
250
more
.
###
Adm.
Goupil
said
the
navy
ca
n't
wait
until
1998
,
when
the
naval
Rafale
becomes
available
,
to
replace
its
obsolete
fleet
of
American-made
Crusaders
,
used
since
the
1950s
to
protect
carriers
from
attack
.
###
Rather
than
renovate
the
Crusaders
,
which
Dassault
is
proposing
to
do
for
around
1.8
billion
French
francs
-LRB-
$
286.6
million
-RRB-
,
Adm.
Goupil
said
the
navy
wants
to
buy
used
F-18s
from
the
U.S.
Navy
.
###
Officially
,
the
statement
is
n't
an
attack
on
the
Rafale
.
###
Adm.
Goupil
said
that
when
the
F-18s
wear
out
,
the
navy
is
prepared
to
take
Rafales
to
replace
them
.
###
But
unofficially
,
senior
navy
officials
sharply
criticize
the
Rafale
as
an
air
force
plane
ill-suited
to
carrier
use
.
###
Although
they
never
said
so
publicly
,
they
have
made
no
secret
of
their
preference
for
the
F-18
on
operational
grounds
.
###
Adm.
Goupil
's
comments
are
likely
to
inflame
the
broader
dispute
within
the
military
establishment
here
over
the
role
of
Dassault
.
###
Although
government-controlled
,
Dassault
still
is
run
by
the
founder
's
son
,
Chairman
Serge
Dassault
,
who
has
fiercely
protected
his
company
's
independence
.
###
The
Rafale
project
is
the
result
of
France
's
inability
jointly
to
develop
a
plane
with
other
countries
,
and
French
officials
question
whether
the
state
can
continue
paying
for
expensive
independent
programs
.
###
So
far
,
Mr.
Dassault
has
resisted
pressure
to
change
.
###
What
brought
the
naval
issue
to
a
head
is
that
the
Crusaders
are
literally
falling
apart
,
without
any
immediate
plan
to
replace
them
.
###
Adm.
Goupil
,
a
former
Crusader
squadron
leader
,
said
that
the
last
other
country
to
use
Crusaders
,
the
Philippines
,
retired
its
last
ones
two
years
ago
.
###
A
French
Crusader
crash
a
few
months
ago
heightened
pressure
for
new
planes
here
.
###
Adm.
Goupil
rejected
Dassault
's
proposal
to
renovate
the
Crusaders
,
saying
the
cost
was
impossible
to
estimate
.
###
Even
modernized
,
he
said
,
the
Crusaders
represent
an
obsolete
and
dangerous
protection
for
the
aircraft
carriers
France
has
sent
to
meet
such
crises
as
the
wars
in
Lebanon
and
the
Persian
Gulf
.
###
Defense
Minister
Jean-Pierre
Chevenement
told
a
meeting
of
the
Anglo-American
Press
Association
that
the
question
of
modernizing
the
Crusaders
or
buying
used
F18s
is
a
``
political
''
decision
that
he
will
make
in
due
time
.

the

said
.
###
The

cited

###
Spending
by

in

adjusted

.
###
For
Cathay
Pacific
Airways
,
the
smooth
ride
may
be
ending
.
###
The
first
signs
of
trouble
came
last
month
when
the
Hong
Kong
carrier
,
a
subsidiary
of
Swire
Pacific
Ltd.
,
posted
a
5
%
drop
in
operating
profit
for
the
first
six
months
and
warned
that
margins
will
remain
under
pressure
for
the
rest
of
the
year
.
###
Securities
analysts
,
many
of
whom
scrapped
their
buy
recommendations
after
seeing
Cathay
's
interim
figures
,
believe
more
jolts
lie
ahead
.
###
Fuel
and
personnel
costs
are
rising
,
and
tourism
in
and
through
Hong
Kong
remains
clouded
by
China
's
turmoil
since
the
June
4
killings
in
Beijing
.
###
In
addition
,
delivery
delays
for
the
first
two
of
as
many
as
28
Boeing
747-400s
that
the
carrier
has
ordered
have
raised
costs
because
personnel
had
been
hired
to
man
the
planes
.
###
And
tough
competition
in
the
air-freight
market
is
cutting
into
an
important
sideline
.
###
There
also
is
concern
that
once
Hong
Kong
reverts
to
China
's
sovereignty
in
1997
,
Cathay
will
be
forced
to
play
second
fiddle
to
China
's
often-disparaged
flag
carrier
,
Civil
Aviation
Administration
of
China
,
or
CAAC
.
###
``
The
sense
is
we
would
never
be
in
a
position
again
where
everything
works
for
us
the
way
it
did
before
,
''
says
Rod
Eddington
,
Cathay
's
commercial
director
.
###
Sarah
Hall
,
an
analyst
at
James
Capel
-LRB-
Far
East
-RRB-
Ltd.
,
says
there
is
n't
much
Cathay
can
do
about
rising
costs
for
jet
fuel
,
Hong
Kong
's
tight
labor
market
,
or
the
strengthening
of
the
local
currency
,
which
is
pegged
to
the
U.S.
dollar
.
###
These
factors
are
further
complicated
by
the
airline
's
push
to
transform
itself
from
a
regional
carrier
to
an
international
one
,
Ms.
Hall
says
.
###
Ms.
Hall
expects
Cathay
's
profit
to
grow
around
13
%
annually
this
year
and
next
.
###
In
1988
,
it
earned
$
2.82
billion
Hong
Kong
-LRB-
US$
361.5
million
-RRB-
on
revenue
of
HK$
11.79
billion
.
###
Cathay
is
taking
several
steps
to
bolster
business
.
###
One
step
is
to
beef
up
its
fleet
.
###
In
addition
to
aircraft
from
Boeing
Co.
,
Cathay
announced
earlier
this
year
an
order
for
as
many
as
20
Airbus
A330-300s
.
###
The
expansion
,
which
could
cost
as
much
as
US$
5.7
billion
over
the
next
eight
years
,
will
expand
the
fleet
to
about
43
planes
by
1991
,
up
from
30
at
the
end
of
last
year
,
according
to
Sun
Hung
Kai
Securities
Ltd
.
###
The
fuel-efficient
Airbus
planes
will
be
used
largely
to
replace
Cathay
's
aging
fleet
of
Lockheed
Tristars
for
regional
flights
,
while
the
Boeing
aircraft
will
be
used
on
long-haul
routes
to
Europe
and
North
America
.
###
Cathay
also
is
moving
some
of
its
labor-intensive
data-processing
operations
outside
Hong
Kong
.
###
Fierce
bidding
for
young
employees
in
Hong
Kong
is
pushing
up
Cathay
's
labor
costs
by
20
%
a
year
for
low-level
staff
,
while
experienced
,
skilled
employees
are
leaving
the
colony
as
part
of
the
brain
drain
.
###
Some
jobs
already
have
been
moved
to
Australia
,
and
there
are
plans
to
place
others
in
Canada
.
###
David
Bell
,
a
spokesman
for
the
airline
,
says
the
move
is
partly
aimed
at
retaining
existing
staff
who
are
leaving
to
secure
foreign
passports
ahead
of
1997
.
###
Cathay
is
working
to
promote
Hong
Kong
as
a
destination
worth
visiting
on
its
own
merits
,
rather
than
just
a
stopover
.
###
Although
the
June
4
killings
in
Beijing
have
hurt
its
China
flights
,
Cathay
's
other
routes
have
retained
high
load
factors
.
###
Mr.
Eddington
regards
promoting
Hong
Kong
as
an
important
part
of
attracting
visitors
from
Japan
,
South
Korea
and
Taiwan
,
where
the
number
of
people
looking
to
travel
abroad
has
surged
.
###
There
also
has
been
speculation
that
Cathay
will
be
among
the
major
private-sector
participants
in
the
Hong
Kong
government
's
plans
to
build
a
new
airport
,
with
the
carrier
possibly
investing
in
its
own
terminal
.
###
Cathay
officials
decline
to
comment
on
the
speculation
.
###
Mr.
Eddington
sees
alliances
with
other
carriers
--
particularly
Cathay
's
recent
link
with
AMR
Corp.
's
American
Airlines
--
as
an
important
part
of
Cathay
's
strategy
.
###
But
he
emphasizes
that
Cathay
has
n't
any
interest
in
swapping
equity
stakes
with
the
U.S.
carrier
or
with
Lufthansa
,
the
West
German
airline
with
which
it
has
cooperated
for
about
a
decade
.
###
Analysts
believe
Cathay
is
approached
for
such
swaps
by
other
carriers
on
a
regular
basis
,
particularly
as
the
popularity
of
share
exchanges
has
grown
among
European
carriers
.
###
``
We
think
alliances
are
very
important
,
''
Mr.
Eddington
says
.
###
``
But
we
'd
rather
put
funds
into
our
own
business
rather
than
someone
else
's
.
###
I
'm
not
sure
cross-ownership
would
necessarily
make
things
smoother
.
''
###
In
a
pattern
it
aims
to
copy
in
several
key
U.S.
destinations
,
Cathay
recently
announced
plans
to
serve
San
Francisco
by
flying
into
American
Airlines
'
Los
Angeles
hub
and
routing
continuing
passengers
onto
a
flight
on
the
U.S.
carrier
.
###
``
We
'll
never
have
a
big
operation
in
the
U.S.
,
and
they
'll
never
have
one
as
big
as
us
in
the
Pacific
,
''
Mr.
Eddington
says
.
###
``
But
this
way
,
American
will
coordinate
good
extensions
to
Boston
,
New
York
,
Chicago
and
Dallas
.
###
We
'll
coordinate
on
this
end
to
places
like
Bangkok
,
Singapore
and
Manila
.
''
###
Asian
traffic
,
which
currently
accounts
for
65
%
of
Cathay
's
business
,
is
expected
to
continue
as
the
carrier
's
mainstay
.
###
Cathay
has
long
stated
its
desire
to
double
its
weekly
flights
into
China
to
14
,
and
it
is
applying
to
restart
long-canceled
flights
into
Vietnam
.
###
Further
expansion
into
southern
Europe
is
also
possible
,
says
Mr.
Bell
,
the
spokesman
.
###
While
a
large
number
of
Hong
Kong
companies
have
reincorporated
offshore
ahead
of
1997
,
such
a
move
is
n't
an
option
for
Cathay
because
it
would
jeopardize
its
landing
rights
in
Hong
Kong
.
###
And
Mr.
Eddington
emphatically
rules
out
a
move
to
London
:
``
Our
lifeblood
is
Hong
Kong
traffic
rights
.
''
###
He
says
the
airline
is
putting
its
faith
in
the
Sino-British
agreement
on
Hong
Kong
's
return
to
China
.
###
A
special
section
dealing
with
aviation
rights
states
that
landing
rights
for
Hong
Kong
's
airlines
,
which
include
the
smaller
Hong
Kong
Dragon
Airlines
,
will
continue
to
be
negotiated
by
Hong
Kong
's
government
.
###
But
critics
fret
that
post-1997
officials
ultimately
will
be
responsible
to
Beijing
.
###
``
My
feeling
is
-LCB-
Cathay
does
n't
-RCB-
have
a
hope
in
the
long
run
,
''
says
an
analyst
,
who
declines
to
be
identified
.
###
Cathay
would
love
to
keep
going
,
but
the
general
sense
is
they
're
going
to
have
to
do
something
.
''
###
Mr.
Eddington
acknowledges
that
the
carrier
will
have
to
evolve
and
adapt
to
local
changes
,
but
he
feels
that
the
Sino-British
agreement
is
firm
ground
to
build
on
for
the
foreseeable
future
.
###
``
We
're
confident
that
it
protects
our
route
structure
,
''
he
says
,
``
and
our
ability
to
grow
and
prosper
.

###
In
the
hard-hit
Marina
neighborhood
,
life
after
the
earthquake
is
often
all
too
real
,
but
sometimes
surreal
.
###
Some
scenes
:
--
Saturday
morning
,
a
resident
was
given
15
minutes
to
scurry
into
a
sagging
building
and
reclaim
what
she
could
of
her
life
's
possessions
###
Saturday
night
she
dined
in
an
emergency
shelter
on
salmon
steaks
prepared
by
chefs
from
one
of
the
city
's
four-star
restaurants
.
###
--
Mayor
Art
Agnos
stands
in
the
glare
of
television
lights
trying
to
explain
for
the
20th
time
why
the
city
is
severely
restricting
access
to
badly
damaged
structures
.
###
A
couple
in
fashionable
spandex
warm-up
suits
jogs
by
,
headphones
jauntily
in
place
,
weaving
their
way
along
a
street
of
fractured
and
fallen
houses
.
###
At
a
nearby
corner
,
they
swerve
perilously
close
to
a
listing
apartment
house
,
oblivious
to
any
danger
.
###
A
policeman
shakes
his
head
in
amazement
as
he
steers
them
away
.
###
--
A
young
woman
who
has
been
out
of
town
shows
up
at
the
Marina
Middle
School
to
learn
that
her
apartment
is
on
the
condemned
list
.
###
She
is
told
she
ca
n't
enter
unless
she
is
accompanied
by
an
inspector
.
###
She
bursts
into
tears
and
walks
away
.
###
Nearby
,
five
temporary
residents
of
the
school
shelter
sit
on
stools
,
having
their
necks
and
backs
kneaded
by
volunteer
masseuses
.
###
The
Marina
rescue
center
offered
a
very
San
Franciscan
response
to
the
disaster
.
###
In
addition
to
free
massages
,
there
was
free
counseling
,
phone
calls
and
a
free
shuttle
bus
to
a
health
club
,
which
offered
up
its
showers
,
saunas
and
hot
tubs
.
###
The
cafeteria
offered
donated
croissants
and
brie
for
breakfast
,
and
for
dinner
,
pasta
salad
and
chocolate
mousse
torts
along
with
the
salmon
.
###
``
This
has
been
a
15-pound
earthquake
for
me
,
''
said
resident
Joan
O'Shea
,
who
works
in
an
acupuncturist
's
office
.
###
She
and
some
friends
are
considering
offering
earthquake
victims
free
yoga
classes
and
``
aroma
therapy
''
--
massages
with
scented
oils
.
###
She
finds
the
response
of
Marina
residents
--
primarily
yuppies
and
elderly
people
--
to
the
devastation
of
their
homes
``
incredible
.
###
People
have
been
very
respectful
of
each
other
.
###
I
do
n't
know
if
this
would
have
happened
somewhere
else
.
''
###
Out
on
the
streets
,
some
residents
of
badly
damaged
buildings
were
allowed
a
15-minute
scavenger
hunt
through
their
possessions
.
###
``
It
's
so
weird
to
have
to
decide
what
's
really
important
to
you
,
''
said
Barbara
May
.
###
She
went
first
for
personal
mementos
.
###
In
post-earthquake
parlance
,
her
building
is
a
``
red
.
''
###
After
being
inspected
,
buildings
with
substantial
damage
were
color-coded
.
###
Green
allowed
residents
to
re-enter
;
yellow
allowed
limited
access
;
red
allowed
residents
one
last
entry
to
gather
everything
they
could
within
15
minutes
.
###
Reds
and
yellows
went
about
their
business
with
a
kind
of
measured
grimness
.
###
Some
frantically
dumped
belongings
into
pillowcases
,
others
threw
goods
out
windows
.
###
It
did
n't
help
that
on
Saturday
,
after
three
days
of
sunshine
,
it
rained
.
###
``
The
guys
are
going
for
their
skis
,
their
stereos
,
their
personal
computers
,
''
said
Frank
Fitzgerald
,
who
helped
others
empty
their
apartments
.
###
``
The
women
wanted
photo
albums
,
a
certain
brooch
,
kind
of
sentimental
things
.
''
###
He
showed
an
unbroken
,
still-ticking
pocket
watch
that
he
retrieved
for
one
woman
.
###
It
belonged
to
her
grandfather
.
###
Some
residents
defied
orders
and
returned
to
``
red
''
buildings
to
retrieve
goods
.
###
One
building
was
upgraded
to
red
status
while
people
were
taking
things
out
,
and
a
resident
who
was
n't
allowed
to
go
back
inside
called
up
the
stairs
to
his
girlfriend
,
telling
her
to
keep
sending
things
down
to
the
lobby
.
###
A
policewoman
had
to
be
called
in
to
make
her
leave
;
the
policewoman
helped
carry
out
one
last
load
.
###
Enforcement
of
restricted-entry
rules
was
sporadic
,
residents
said
.
###
One
man
trying
to
remove
his
car
was
told
by
officials
to
get
out
of
his
garage
.
###
When
he
sneaked
back
later
to
try
again
,
a
different
policeman
offered
to
help
him
get
the
car
out
.
###
The
Marina
also
has
become
the
focal
point
of
city
efforts
to
reunite
residents
with
any
pets
that
may
have
fled
or
become
lost
during
the
earthquake
.
###
On
lampposts
along
Fillmore
Street
,
a
major
Marina
artery
,
posters
were
offering
a
$
100
reward
for
a
cat
lost
during
the
quake
.
###
The
San
Francisco
Society
for
the
Prevention
of
Cruelty
to
Animals
also
has
been
providing
medical
care
,
food
,
water
and
foster
homes
for
quake-displaced
animals
.
###
The
SPCA
says
it
has
received
more
than
100
requests
for
foster
homes
on
behalf
of
dogs
and
cats
,
though
some
people
have
sought
temporary
homes
for
birds
and
fish
.
###
For
example
,
one
parakeet
owner
returning
home
found
that
her
apartment
,
like
many
others
in
the
Marina
,
did
n't
have
heat
.
###
``
She
can
stay
there
with
no
heat
,
but
for
a
parakeet
,
that
can
be
deadly
,
''
says
Daralee
Konowitch
,
animalcare
services
manager
for
the
SPCA
.
###
A
warm
foster
home
has
been
found
.
###
The
neighborhood
around
Alexander
Haagen
Co.
's
Vermont-Slauson
Shopping
Center
in
the
Watts
section
of
Los
Angeles
resembles
the
crime-ridden
,
deteriorating
sections
of
many
inner
cities
and
certainly
is
n't
the
sort
of
area
one
would
choose
to
visit
.
###
But
turn
into
the
shopping
center
's
parking
lot
,
and
one
could
be
in
the
safe
,
busy
mall
of
a
prosperous
suburb
.
###
Only
it
is
safer
,
and
busier
.
###
Over
the
past
year
there
have
been
only
one
burglary
,
three
thefts
of
or
from
autos
,
no
purse-snatchings
,
and
one
attempted
robbery
in
the
mall
,
which
opened
in
late
1981
.
###
A
shopping
center
of
similar
size
in
an
affluent
Los
Angeles
suburb
would
,
per
year
,
be
expected
to
have
eight
burglaries
,
70
thefts
of
or
from
autos
,
and
four
robberies
.
###
The
Watts
mall
has
annual
sales
of
more
than
$
350
per
leasable
square
foot
;
the
figure
for
a
comparable
suburban
shopping
center
would
be
$
200
.
###
Three
other
Haagen
shopping
centers
in
the
Watts
area
are
doing
almost
as
well
.
###
A
successful
low-crime
mall
in
a
high-crime
area
violates
the
more
typical
inner-city
pattern
,
in
which
commercial
areas
are
taken
over
by
unruly
youth
,
gangs
,
and
the
criminal
element
,
with
an
erosion
of
the
customer
base
,
development
capital
,
and
insurability
.
###
Major
regional
and
national
chain
stores
are
replaced
by
mom-and-pop
operations
offering
poorer-quality
merchandise
at
higher
prices
.
###
Along
with
the
exodus
of
shopping
opportunities
is
an
exodus
of
the
jobs
that
the
major
chains
used
to
provide
to
community
residents
.
###
Thus
there
is
even
more
to
the
Vermont-Slauson
Center
than
a
good
place
to
shop
.
###
This
defensible
commercial
zone
becomes
,
for
the
residents
,
a
secure
oasis
in
a
barren
urban
landscape
,
evidence
that
community
decay
is
not
inevitable
and
that
the
gangs
are
not
invincible
.
###
The
center
improves
the
community
image
to
outsiders
as
well
,
and
may
help
to
arrest
,
or
even
reverse
,
the
exodus
of
capital
and
investment
.
###
An
additional
benefit
is
the
creation
of
jobs
.
###
This
starts
in
the
construction
phase
through
the
use
of
minority
contractors
and
local
workers
.
###
It
continues
through
the
life
of
the
center
;
the
Vermont-Slauson
Center
has
created
500
permanent
private-sector
jobs
at
a
one-time
cost
in
public
funds
of
only
$
2,500
per
job
.
###
As
many
of
these
jobs
are
filled
by
local
residents
,
who
move
from
the
welfare
rolls
to
the
tax
rolls
,
the
$
2,500-per-job
public
investment
should
repay
itself
in
a
few
years
.
###
And
that
is
before
consideration
of
increased
state
and
local
revenues
from
taxes
and
fees
on
sales
,
real
estate
,
licenses
and
the
like
.
###
Profits
are
also
plowed
back
into
the
community
;
the
non-profit
Vermont-Slauson
Economic
Development
Corp.
receives
60
%
of
the
profits
from
the
Vermont-Slauson
Center
and
uses
the
money
to
provide
moderate
and
low-cost
housing
in
the
community
--
now
running
into
the
hundreds
of
units
--
as
well
as
commercial
and
industrial
development
projects
.
###
Bradford
Crowe
,
director
of
the
mayor
's
City
Economic
Development
Office
,
says
:
``
There
is
no
question
that
Vermont-Slauson
had
a
halo
effect
on
the
surrounding
neighborhood
.
###
What
had
been
a
deteriorated
area
with
nothing
but
wig
shops
and
shoe
shops
is
now
experiencing
a
major
upgrading
in
the
housing
and
commercial
stock
,
thanks
to
a
continuously
replenished
source
of
revitalization
capital
that
Vermont-Slauson
yields
.
''
###
Another
benefit
is
that
substantial
percentages
of
the
proprietors
in
these
centers
are
minority
businessmen
and
women
.
###
In
the
Grand
Boulevard
Plaza
developed
by
Matanky
Realty
Group
in
Chicago
's
Third
Ward
,
opposite
the
Robert
Taylor
Homes
,
29
%
of
the
stores
to
date
have
been
leased
to
blacks
and
14
%
to
members
of
other
minority
groups
.
###
Children
from
the
community
will
have
worthier
role
models
than
the
drug
kingpins
.
###
So
what
's
the
catch
?
###
Primarily
that
putting
one
of
these
inner-city
deals
together
takes
time
,
patience
,
breadth
of
vision
and
negotiating
skills
that
not
all
developers
possess
.
###
Security
costs
are
also
quite
high
.
###
One
of
these
centers
can
involve
years
of
negotiating
with
numerous
public
agencies
,
local
political
leaders
,
and
citizen
groups
,
and
with
prospective
tenants
and
sources
of
financing
.
###
Suburban
deals
are
not
without
their
delays
and
complications
--
inner-city
deals
just
have
more
of
them
.
###
Security
at
a
typical
Haagen
inner-city
center
is
impressive
,
but
unobtrusive
.
###
The
entire
site
is
enclosed
by
a
6-to-8-foot-high
ornamental
iron
fence
with
a
small
number
of
remote-controlled
gates
.
###
Shrubs
and
flowers
give
it
a
pleasing
and
non-fortress-like
appearance
.
###
Infrared
motion
detectors
and
closed-circuit
TV
cameras
monitor
the
entire
center
;
lighting
levels
are
three
to
five
times
the
industry
standard
.
###
The
security
command
post
,
camouflaged
as
second-story
retail
space
,
has
its
own
``
crow
's
nest
''
above
the
roofs
of
the
other
buildings
,
with
a
panoramic
view
of
the
entire
center
.
###
Local
law
enforcement
is
present
in
a
sub-station
occupying
space
donated
by
the
center
.
###
These
features
are
also
used
in
Matanky
Realty
Group
's
Grand
Boulevard
Plaza
.
###
Haagen
has
its
own
large
security
force
of
well-trained
and
well-paid
personnel
on
round-the-clock
duty
at
each
center
.
###
Security
is
60
%
to
70
%
of
the
common
area
charges
of
these
centers
,
vs.
an
industry
average
of
about
15
%
.
###
These
security
costs
are
kept
off-budget
because
the
centers
'
site
acquisition
,
construction
,
and
financing
costs
were
reduced
by
such
programs
as
Urban
Development
Action
Grants
,
Economic
Development
Administration
Grants
,
Community
Development
Block
Grants
,
tax-free
Industrial
Development
Bonds
,
Enterprise
Zone
tax
write-offs
,
city
infrastructure
grants
,
and
tax
increment
financing
.
###
Many
of
these
programs
no
longer
exist
,
or
have
been
severely
cut
back
.
###
However
,
since
these
centers
appear
to
pay
for
themselves
,
there
is
nothing
to
prevent
state
and
local
governments
from
enacting
legislation
with
similar
provisions
.
###
Many
states
already
have
Enterprise
Zones
and
legislation
that
combines
tax
incentives
,
loans
,
and
grants
to
encourage
investment
in
depressed
areas
with
requirements
for
the
hiring
of
the
unemployed
and
minorities
.
###
These
programs
could
be
expanded
to
focus
on
funds
for
project
planning
,
identifying
sources
of
funds
,
and
for
acquiring
a
site
and
preparing
it
.
###
Combatting
crime
and
the
fear
of
it
in
inner-city
commercial
areas
should
give
Enterprise
Zones
more
success
than
most
have
enjoyed
to
date
.
###
With
many
suburban
areas
basically
overbuilt
with
shopping
centers
,
inner-city
areas
may
represent
a
major
new
untapped
market
for
investment
.
###
New
approaches
to
mall
design
and
operation
make
it
possible
to
tap
these
markets
.
###
If
the
risks
and
rewards
are
reasonable
,
developers
will
respond
.
###
Government
officials
who
wonder
how
important
it
is
for
them
to
encourage
development
in
high-risk
areas
should
visit
Vermont-Slauson
and
Grand
Boulevard
Plaza
and
decide
for
themselves
.
###
The
answer
will
be
obvious
.
###
Mr.
Titus
is
a
researcher
at
the
Justice
Department
's
National
Institute
of
Justice
.
###
ATHLONE

Dow

said
its

unit
has
agreed

buy

a

in
a

of
$
12.25
a

###
Among
other
conditions
,
the
offer
depends
on
the
Dow
unit
acquiring
at

66
%
of

outstanding
,
the
companies
said
in
a
joint
statement
Friday
.
###
PSE
has
about
9.2
million

outstanding
.
###
The
company
said
the
approximately
$
115
million
acquisition
price
includes
its
total
$
33
million
of
long-term

###
If
growth
regains
its
glamour
among
investors
,
a
sluggish
segment
of
the
Nasdaq
over-the-counter
market
could
show
some
flash
.
###
Some
stock
pickers
already
are
targeting
the
OTC
market
,
where
,
they
say
,
await
plenty
of
small
-
and
medium-sized
growth
stocks
.
###
Best
of
all
,
they
add
,
these
growth
issues
,
unlike
their
big
blue-chip
cousins
on
the
New
York
Stock
Exchange
,
are
languishing
at
depressed
prices
.
###
Growth
stocks
will
return
to
favor
,
some
analysts
and
money
managers
think
,
because
of
the
jitters
caused
by
the
market
's
steep
slide
on
Oct.
13
,
and
because
of
the
current
swell
of
disappointing
earnings
announcements
.
###
Against
such
a
backdrop
,
companies
with
proven
track
records
of
earnings
gains
of
20
%
or
so
annually
have
extra
appeal
.
###
``
The
market
will
have
to
look
for
a
new
theme
now
and
that
theme
will
be
a
return
to
growth
,
''
declares
Mary
Farrell
,
a
PaineWebber
analyst
.
###
Among
her
OTC
picks
are
Oshkosh
B'Gosh
and
A&W
Brands
.
###
Like
many
OTC
growth
issues
,
they
have
market
values
--
as
measured
by
stock
price
times
shares
outstanding
--
of
roughly
$
100
million
to
$
500
million
.
###
Some
like
to
specialize
in
growth
companies
whose
shares
have
n't
traded
publicly
very
long
.
###
These
are
sometimes
dubbed
``
emerging
''
growth
companies
,
though
they
also
have
expanding-profit
track
records
.
###
While
many
growth
stocks
are
small
,
not
all
small
stocks
have
earnings-growth
momentum
.
###
That
's
an
important
distinction
because
some
analysts
and
brokers
,
who
perennially
predict
that
small
stocks
are
about
to
outperform
bigger
issues
,
may
use
any
spurt
in
growth
issues
to
help
them
sell
all
small
stocks
.
###
``
You
can
find
some
good
,
quality
companies
over
the
counter
,
''
but
investors
should
be
selective
,
says
John
Palicka
,
chief
portfolio
manager
at
Midco
Investors
,
a
Newark
,
N.J.
,
money
management
company
with
about
$
900
million
invested
in
growth
stocks
of
varying
sizes
.
###
Mr.
Palicka
's
picks
from
the
OTC
market
include
Legent
,
Mail
Boxes
Etc.
,
and
Payco
American
.
###
The
main
argument
for
growth
stocks
is
their
usually
superior
performance
in
a
slowing
economy
.
###
``
If
the
market
refocuses
on
earnings
,
we
should
get
better
valuations
of
growth
stocks
,
''
says
L.
Keith
Mullins
,
a
growth-stock
analyst
at
Morgan
Stanley
.
###
Eventually
,
he
believes
,
investors
will
be
willing
to
pay
higher
prices
for
companies
with
proven
track
records
of
earnings
growth
.
###
In
anticipation
of
that
shift
,
he
and
other
analysts
are
encouraging
their
clients
to
buy
such
issues
now
.
###
Understandably
,
smaller
growth
stocks
have
n't
been
in
favor
recently
.
###
The
average
issue
on
Standard
&
Poor
's
500-stock
Index
gained
35
%
last
year
,
Ms.
Farrell
of
PaineWebber
says
.
###
Smaller-stock
earnings
,
by
comparison
,
rose
between
15
%
and
20
%
.
###
In
addition
,
earnings
growth
took
a
back
seat
to
cash
flow
,
restructuring
and
takeover
potential
,
and
breakup
value
as
the
preferred
stock-picking
standards
for
much
of
the
year
.
###
Also
,
the
smaller
growth
stocks
are
n't
widely
traded
,
and
so
are
harder
to
buy
and
sell
quickly
than
blue
chips
.
###
As
a
result
,
Morgan
Stanley
's
Index
of
40
Emerging
Growth
Stocks
--
most
of
which
are
in
the
OTC
market
--
is
up
only
13
%
for
the
year
,
while
the
Dow
Jones
Industrial
Average
has
leaped
24
%
and
the
S&P
500
has
grown
25
%
.
###
The
Nasdaq
Composite
has
gained
23
%
this
year
,
but
that
's
largely
due
to
the
100
largest
nonfinancial
stocks
,
which
have
soared
30
%
.
###
Some
investors
are
skeptical
of
growth
stocks
because
investing
in
them
means
ignoring
that
maxim
found
in
the
fine
print
of
some
investment
advertisements
--
that
past
performance
is
n't
indicative
of
future
results
.
###
``
People
are
naturally
suspicious
of
them
,
''
says
Mr.
Mullins
of
Morgan
Stanley
.
###
Among
his
favorites
in
his
firm
's
index
are
Legent
,
Silicon
Graphics
and
Novell
.
###
However
,
more
money
managers
are
reassured
that
profit
is
regaining
importance
.
###
Mark
Schoeppner
,
portfolio
manager
at
Pittsburgh-based
Quaker
Capital
Management
,
says
that
in
reaction
to
nervousness
about
debt-laden
buy-out
transactions
,
analysts
and
investors
now
appear
to
be
``
valuing
stock
based
on
future
earnings
as
opposed
to
the
amount
of
debt
the
company
can
support
.
''
###
Barney
Hallingby
,
managing
director
of
research
at
Hambrecht
&
Quist
,
also
believes
earnings
growth
is
beginning
to
play
a
greater
part
in
investors
'
buying
decisions
.
###
On
Friday
,
Hambrecht
&
Quist
added
St.
Jude
Medical
to
the
list
of
20
stocks
it
strongly
recommends
.
###
The
opinion
is
largely
based
on
the
company
's
earnings
momentum
,
Mr.
Hallingby
says
.
###
St.
Jude
's
market
value
on
Nasdaq
exceeds
$
1
billion
,
so
it
is
n't
a
small
stock
.
###
The
medical
devices
maker
's
earnings
rose
nearly
35
%
in
1987
from
1986
,
and
75
%
in
1988
.
###
Kurt
Kruger
,
who
follows
the
stock
for
Hambrecht
&
Quist
,
anticipates
that
the
company
's
net
income
will
grow
51
%
to

2.15
a

year

For
bankers
and
regulators
,
Arizona
is
looking
more
like
Texas
every
day
.
###
On
Friday
,
Los
Angeles-based
First
Interstate
Bancorp
said
it
expects
a
net
loss
of
$
16
million
for
the
third
quarter
of
1989
because
of
hemorrhaging
at
its
First
Interstate
Bank
of
Arizona
unit
.
###
First
Interstate
said
the
unit
,
bludgeoned
by
Arizona
's
worsening
real-estate
woes
,
will
have
a
$
174
million
loss
for
the
quarter
.
###
First
Interstate
took
a
huge
$
350
million
provision
for
loan
losses
at
the
Arizona
bank
.
###
It
charged
off
an
estimated
$
200
million
of
Arizona
loans
,
leaving
the
unit
with
a
reserve
for
future
losses
of
$
255
million
,
about
61
%
of
its
$
416
million
of
troubled
loans
and
repossessed
real
estate
.
###
First
Interstate
made
the
move
under
pressure
from
regulators
.
###
The
action
capped
a
spurt
of
grim
Arizona
banking
news
for
the
third
quarter
,
and
emphatically
signaled
that
Arizona
is
challenging
Texas
's
long
reign
as
banking
's
busiest
graveyard
.
###
Earlier
last
week
,
Valley
National
Corp.
,
the
state
's
largest
locally
owned
banking
company
,
reported
a
$
72.2
million
loss
and
suspended
its
dividend
.
###
Pinnacle
West
Capital
Corp.
,
which
has
been
wrangling
with
regulators
for
months
over
what
to
do
about
Pinnacle
's
moribund
Merabank
thrift
unit
,
suspended
its
dividend
and
reported
a
91
%
plunge
in
third-quarter
net
income
.
###
Security
Pacific
Corp.
said
third-quarter
credit
losses
surged
a
third
to
$
109
million
,
mainly
because
of
sour
Arizona
real-estate
loans
.
###
New
York-based
Chase
Manhattan
Corp.
took
an
$
85
million
Arizona-related
charge
.
###
Furthermore
,
the
regulatory
maneuvering
behind
First
Interstate
's
loss
suggests
regulators
have
concluded
that
lenders
'
reserves
are
far
too
low
to
absorb
their
future
Arizona
losses
and
are
forcing
bankers
to
do
something
about
it
.
###
Examiners
from
the
Office
of
the
Comptroller
of
the
Currency
had
been
combing
through
First
Interstate
's
real-estate
portfolio
since
last
month
;
they
first
recommended
that
First
Interstate
take
a
provision
that
was
less
than
the
eventual
$
350
million
third-quarter
hit
.
###
When
First
Interstate
balked
,
arguing
that
the
figure
was
too
high
,
regulators
responded
by
raising
their
recommendation
to
$
350
million
.
###
``
At
that
point
,
-LCB-
First
Interstate
-RCB-
decided
it
was
the
better
part
of
valor
not
to
negotiate
further
,
''
said
one
industry
official
close
to
the
talks
.
###
Thomas
P.
Marrie
,
chief
financial
officer
,
would
n't
comment
about
the
details
of
the
negotiations
.
###
He
said
the
provision
``
was
n't
forced
upon
us
,
but
the
regulators
made
it
very
clear
what
they
thought
was
an
appropriate
number
.
''
###
The
tough
regulatory
stance
portends
large
future
losses
,
especially
at
the
state
's
thrifts
.
###
At
least
six
of
Arizona
's
12
savings
and
loan
institutions
have
either
been
taken
over
by
the
government
's
conservatorship
program
or
are
essentially
insolvent
;
they
are
sitting
on
enormous
unrecognized
losses
.
###
For
example
,
Western
Savings
&
Loan
Association
,
which
is
now
in
conservatorship
,
had
tangible
capital-assets
minus
liabilities
--
of
a
negative
$
357.4
million
at
June
30
.
###
It
had
a
$
258.9
million
loss
in
the
second
quarter
.
###
Yet
it
still
held
$
916.3
million
of
repossessed
real
estate
,
for
which
it
maintains
no
reserves
whatsoever
.
###
It
also
had
$
479.7
million
of
past-due
loans
;
its
level
of
reserves
against
those
was
n't
immediately
available
,
though
it
is
believed
to
be
small
.
###
The
rapid
deterioration
of
the
Arizona
thrifts
only
adds
to
the
ever-swelling
cost
of
the
government
's
massive
thrift
bailout
,
officially
estimated
at
about
$
166
billion
.
###
Together
,
the
six
government-controlled
or
essentially
insolvent
Arizona
thrifts
have
tangible
capital
of
a
negative
$
1.5
billion
,
foreclosed
property
of
$
1.8
billion
and
pastdue
loans
of
$
1.63
billion
.
###
They
have
no
reserves
against
the
real
estate
,
and
their
reserves
against
the
loans
are
miniscule
compared
with
the
levels
of
reserves
banks
are
moving
to
set
up
.
###
The
thrifts
had
a
combined
loss
of
$
487.8
million
in
the
second
quarter
.
###
Other
lenders
have
been
recovering
only
50
cents
to
60
cents
on
the
dollar
on
foreclosed
Arizona
property
,
if
they
can
sell
it
at
all
.
###
All
this
havoc
is
the
result
of
one
of
the
worst
busts
in
Arizona
's
boom-and-bust
history
,
compounded
by
some
of
the
usual
suspects
in
1980s
banking
debacles
:
greed
,
fraud
and
plain
bad
banking
.
###
In
the
late
1970s
and
early
1980s
,
lenders
and
developers
poured
money
into
office
buildings
,
condominiums
and
massive
tracts
of
raw
desert
land
,
confident
that
Arizona
's
population
would
grow
at
annual
rates
of
4
%
to
6
%
for
years
to
come
.
###
Now
,
annual
population
growth
is
running
at
about
2
%
a
year
,
some
desert
tracts
bought
three
years
ago
for
$
90,000
an
acre
are
being
sold
at
$
25,000
an
acre
and
Phoenix
has
a
seven-year
supply
of
unoccupied
office
space
.
###
``
It
's
horrible
to
say
,
but
it
's
unfortunate
that
earthquake
was
n't
in
Phoenix
--
it
might
have
knocked
out
some
of
our
empty
buildings
,
''
said
C.W.
Jackson
,
a
prominent
Arizona
businessman
with
interests
in
real
estate
,
banking
and
many
other
businesses
.
###
Many
Arizona
real-estate
experts
think
the
worst
may
be
yet
to
come
.
###
Ralph
Shattuck
,
publisher
of
Foreclosure
Update
newsletter
,
said
foreclosures
have
climbed
to
about
1,482
a
month
just
in
Maricopa
County
,
where
Phoenix
is
located
.
###
That
's
up
from
about
687
a
month
in
1985
,
and
it
's
accelerating
:
So
far
this
month
,
foreclosures
are
averaging
about
85
a
day
.
###
``
It
's
frightening
,
''
Mr.
Shattuck
said
.
###
Moreover
,
Mr.
Shattuck
and
others
said
residential
real
estate
,
which
had
remained
fairly
strong
through
most
of
the
downturn
,
is
beginning
to
comprise
more
and
more
of
the
foreclosures
.
###
And
the
generally
frail
condition
of
Arizona
's
lenders
means
there
is
little
capital
available
in
the
state
to
shore
up
the
economy
and
slow
down
the
slide
.
###
``
It
's
reasonable
to
say
there
is
not
a
solvent
S&L
in
the
state
and
the
amount
of
viable
bank
capital
is
very
low
,
''
said
Mr.
Jackson
.
###
``
We
're
going
to
see
another
big
wave
of
failures
and
defaults
between
now
and
year-end
.
###
The
only
thing
a
lot
of
these
lenders
can
get
out
of
their
mouth
now
is
:
`
Pay
me
in
60
days
.
'
''
###
First
Interstate
had
a
$
214.4
million
loss
in
1988
's
third
quarter
,
mainly
from
writedowns
and
reserves
connected
with
its
Texas
operations
.
###
For
the
six
months
ended
June
30
,
it
reported
net
income
of
$
234.3
million
,
or
$
4.83
a
share
,
including
$
46
million
from
tax
credits
and
accounting
changes
.
###
The
bank
's
Arizona
unit
holds
about
$
6
billion
of
First
Interstate
's
$
50
billion
of
assets
.
###
Mr.
Marrie
said
the
bank
expects
Arizona
real-estate
prices
,
which
plummeted
40
%
over
the
last
year
,
to
fall
another
20
%
before
stabilizing
.
###
Some
in
Arizona
think
that
may
be
optimistic
.
###
First
Interstate
said
its
operations
outside
of
Arizona
``
achieved
results
as
expected
for
the
quarter
,
''
but
did
n't
specify
the
results
.
###
First
Interstate
stock
closed
at
$
57.625
,
down
25
cents
,
in
composite
trading
Friday
on
the
New
York
Stock
Exchange
.
###
Since
its
unsuccessful
bid
for
BankAmerica
Corp.
in
1986
,
the
bank
has
undertaken
a
major
restructuring
in
an
effort
to
cut
costs
and
boost
performance
,
but
many
industry
officials
believe
it
may
be
ripe
for
a
takeover
bid
,
especially
with
interstate
banking
set
to
begin
in
California
in
1991
.
###
Mr.
Marrie
said
the
problems
in
Arizona
have
only
``
increased
our
resolve
to
continue
to
make
our
restructuring
even
more
effective
.
''
###
Separately
,
Standard
&
Poor
's
Corp.
lowered
its
ratings
on
Valley
National
Corp.
's
senior
debt
to
double-B
from
double-B-plus
,
affecting
about
$
300
million
of
long-term
debt
.
###
S&P
also
lowered
ratings
on
unsecured
deposits
and
issues
backed
by
a
letter
of
credit
from
the
bank
holding
company
's
principal
unit
,
Valley
National
Bank
of
Arizona
.
###
The
ratings
service
said
the
downgrades
reflect
the
continued
slide
in
the
company
's
financial
condition
.
###
A
spokesman
for
Phoenix
,
Ariz.-based
Valley
National
,
said
the
concern
will
be
able
to
withstand
the
current
downturn
in
Arizona
real
estate
.
###
Commercial
paper
holders
have
reinvested
their
funds
,
he
said
,
and
consumer
deposits
have
been
up
in
the
last
few
days
.
###
Immunex
Corp.
said
its
scientists
isolated
a
molecule
which
may
hold
potential
as
a
treatment
for
disruptions
of
the
immune-system
,
ranging
from
organ-transplant
rejection
,
to
allergies
and
asthma
.
###
The
molecule
is
the
mouse
version
of
a
protein
called
the
interleukin-4
receptor
.
###
IL-4
is
a
hormone
which
directs
the
growth
and
function
of
white
blood
cells
involved
in
the
body
's
immune
response
.
###
The
IL-4
receptor
on
the
surface
of
such
cells
receives
the
hormone
's
message
to
rally
the
body
's
defense
.
###
But
in
certain
conditions
such
as
autoimmune
diseases
and
allergies
and
transplant
rejection
,
doctors
would
like
to
damp
the
immune
response
so
such
cells
do
n't
touch
off
harmful
inflammatory
reactions
or
cell
destruction
.
###
A
soluble
form
of
the
receptor
might
turn
off
a
specific
part
of
the
immune
response
without
general
immune
suppression
,
the
company
said
.
###
The
IL-4
receptor
is
one
of
five
such
receptors
to
be
developed
and
tested
by
Receptech
Corp.
,
a
spinoff
of
Immunex
,
through
a
proposed
$
30
million
initial
public
offering
.
###
Immunex
will
contract
with
the
spinoff
to
provide
the
research
,
development
and
initial
testing
of
the
new
agents
.
###
Immunex
will
have
the
option
to
buy
back
Receptech
shares
after
five
years
.

###
Conner
Peripherals
Inc.
,
which
has
a
near-monopoly
on
a
key
part
used
in
many
portable
computers
,
is
on
target
to
surpass
Compaq
Computer
Corp.
as
the
fastest-growing
start-up
manufacturing
firm
in
U.S.
business
history
.
###
Conner
dominates
the
market
for
hard-disk
drives
used
to
store
data
in
laptop
computers
.
###
It
said
yesterday
that
net
income
for
its
third
quarter
soared
72
%
to
$
11.8
million
,
or
28
cents
a
share
,
from
$
6.8
million
,
or
19
cents
a
share
,
in
the
year-ago
period
.
###
Its
revenue
totaled
$
184.4
million
,
an
increase
of
172
%
from
$
67.8
million
a
year
ago
.
###
For
the
nine
months
,
the
San
Jose
,
Calif.-based
company
said
net
income
jumped
84
%
to
$
26.9
million
,
or
69
cents
a
share
,
from
$
14.6
million
,
or
43
cents
a
share
.
###
Revenue
nearly
tripled
to
$
479
million
,
from
$
160
million
.
###
Analysts
expect
Conner
's
earnings
to
reach
roughly
$
40
million
,
or
$
1
to
$
1.05
a
share
,
on
sales
of
$
650
million
,
for
1989
,
the
company
's
third
full
year
in
business
.
###
That
's
a
faster
growth
rate
than
reported
by
Compaq
,
which
did
n't
post
similar
results
until
its
fourth
year
,
in
1986
.
###
But
Compaq
had
achieved
that
level
of
sales
faster
than
any
previous
manufacturing
start-up
.
###
Conner
's
performance
is
closely
tied
to
the
burgeoning
demand
for
battery-operated
computers
,
the
computer
industry
's
fastest-growing
segment
.
###
Since
its
inception
,
Conner
has
both
benefited
from
and
helped
make
possible
the
rapid
spread
of
portable
computers
by
selling
storage
devices
that
consume
five
to
10
times
less
electricity
than
drives
used
in
desktop
machines
.
###
Today
,
Conner
controls
an
estimated
90
%
of
the
hard-disk
drive
market
for
laptop
computers
.
###
The
company
supplies
drives
to
Compaq
and
Zenith
Data
Systems
,
the
top
two
U.S.
manufacturers
of
laptops
,
and
to
Toshiba
Corp.
,
NEC
Corp.
and
Sharp
Corp.
,
the
leading
Japanese
laptop
makers
.
###
``
They
've
had
this
field
to
themselves
for
over
a
year
now
,
and
they
've
been
greatly
rewarded
,
''
said
Bob
Katsive
,
an
analyst
at
Inc.
,
a
market
researcher
in
Los
Altos
,
Calif
.
###
In
the
coming
months
,
however
,
this
is
likely
to
change
.
###
Next
month
,
Seagate
Technology
,
which
is
the
dominant
supplier
of
hard-disk
drives
for
personal
computers
,
plans
to
introduce
its
first
family
of
low-power
drives
for
battery-operated
computers
.
###
And
the
Japanese
are
likely
to
keep
close
on
Conner
's
heels
.
###
``
They
are
going
to
catch
up
,
''
said
David
Claridge
,
an
analyst
with
Hambrecht
&
Quist
.
###
Both
Toshiba
and
NEC
already
produce
hard-disk
drives
,
and
Sony
also
is
studying
the
field
,
Mr.
Claridge
said
.
###
But
Conner
is
n't
standing
still
.
###
Yesterday
,
the
company
introduced
four
products
,
three
of
which
are
aimed
at
a
hot
new
class
of
computers
called
notebooks
.
###
Each
of
the
three
drives
uses
a
mere
1.5
watts
of
power
and
one
weighs
just
5.5
ounces
.
###
``
Most
of
our
competitors
are
announcing
products
based
on
our
-LRB-
older
-RRB-
products
,
''
said
Finis
Conner
,
chief
executive
officer
and
founder
of
the
firm
that
bears
his
name
.
###
``
We
continue
to
develop
products
faster
than
anyone
else
can
.
''
###
These
new
products
could
account
for
as
much
as
35
%
of
the
company
's
business
in
1990
,
Mr.
Conner
estimated
.
###
``
We
're
not
afraid
of
obsoleting
some
of
our
old
stuff
to
stay
ahead
of
the
competition
,
''
he
said
.
###
Conner
already
is
shipping
its
new
drives
.
###
Last
week
,
for
instance
,
Compaq
introduced
its
first
notebook
computer
to
rave
reviews
.
###
Conner
is
supplying
hard-disk
drives
for
the
machine
,
which
weighs
only
six
pounds
and
fits
in
a
briefcase
.
###
From
its
inception
,
Conner
has
targeted
the
market
for
battery-operated
machines
,
building
hard-disk
drives
that
are
smaller
and
use
far
less
power
than
those
offered
by
competitors
such
as
Seagate
.
###
The
availability
of
these
drives
,
in
turn
,
boosted
demand
for
laptop
computers
,
whose
usefulness
had
been
limited
because
of
lack
of
storage
.
###
Conner
also
makes
hard-disk
drives
for
desktop
computers
and
is
a
major
supplier
to
Compaq
,
which
as
of
July
owned
40
%
of
Conner
's
stock
.
###
Sales
to
Compaq
represented
26

A
legal
service
with
a
``
900
''
number
has
been
launched
in
California
.
###
A
Newport
Beach
law
firm
started
the
pay-as-you-go
legal
service
,
called
Telelawyer
,
using
MCI
Communication
Corp.
's
toll-tele-phone
service
.
###
Cane
&
Associates
touts
its
$
2-a-minute
service
as
the
``
cheapest
legal
hour
you
'll
ever
find
.
''
###
Though
the
service
is
available
only
in
California
,
Telelawyer
founder
Michael
Cane
says
he
plans
to
franchise
it
in
other
states
.
###
He
says
his
aim
is
to
reach
people
who
are
bedridden
,
have
no
access
to
transportation
,
ca
n't
find
a
lawyer
to
take
their
case
or
simply
ca
n't
afford
lawyers
'
consultation
fees
.
###
Mr.
Cane
stresses
that
he
is
n't
using
the
telephone
to
lure
clients
to
his
doorstep
.
###
``
We
will
only
deal
with
clients
on
the
phone
,
''
he
says
.
###
We
have
no
in-office
business
.
''
###
Telelawyer
is
apparently
the
only
telephone
service
that
offers
the
telephone
equivalent
of
an
office
visit
.
###
Local
bar
associations
in
some
states
have
numbers
that
provide
free
tape-recorded
messages
explaining
certain
areas
of
the
law
.
###
There
also
are
``
800
''
hotlines
which
refer
people
to
lawyers
,
usually
personal-injury
specialists
,
for
in-office
consultation
.
###
When
a
caller
reaches
Telelawyer
by
dialing
900-TELELAW
,
a
receptionist
refers
the
call
to
one
of
six
attorneys
.
###
In
an
effort
to
determine
whether
a
caller
has
reason
to
sue
,
Cane
lawyers
review
documents
and
perform
research
,
if
necessary
,
with
the
help
of
three
law
clerks
and
several
support
staffers
.
###
There
is
no
charge
for
research
--
only
for
time
on
the
phone
.
###
If
the
matter
requires
further
legal
work
or
litigation
,
Mr.
Cane
says
,
his
lawyers
may
refer
the
client
to
a
law
firm
.
###
But
he
says
Cane
&
Associates
does
n't
receive
referral
fees
.
###
So
far
,
says
Mr.
Cane
,
most
calls
have
involved
landlord-tenant
problems
,
tax
problems
,
divorce
,
and
probate
questions
.
###
The
firm
is
getting
about
50
calls
a
day
,
and
the
average
call
lasts
about
15
minutes
.
###
Out
of
the

JURY
CONVICTS
congressman
in
connection
with
Wedtech
Corp.
scandal
.
###
A
federal
court
jury
in
New

found
U.S.
Rep.
Robert
Garcia
-LRB-
D.
,
N.Y
.
-RRB-
and
his
wife
,
Jane
Lee
Garcia
,
guilty
of
extorting
$
76,000
from
Wedtech
in
return
for
official
acts
by
the
congressman
.
###
The
jury
also
convicted
them
of
extortion
in
obtaining
a
$
20,000
,
interest-free
loan
from
a
Wedtech
officer
.
###
The
jury
found
them
guilty
of
conspiracy
in
obtaining
the
payments
,
some
of
which
were
disguised
as
fees
for
consulting
services
from
Mrs.
Garcia
.
###
Wedtech

became
embroiled

###
Edward
J.M.
Little
,
one
of
the
assistant
U.S.
attorneys
who
prosecuted
the
case
,
said
the
Garcia
trial
``
is
the
last
of

Wedtech
prosecutions

''
###
Mr.
Little
said
more
than
20

including
former
U.S.
Rep.
Mario
Biaggi
-LRB-

###
Lawyers
for
the
Garcias

.
###
Mr.
Garcia
,
who
represents
New

's
18th
congressional
district
,
which
includes
the
Bronx
,
said
he
has
n't
decided
whether
he
will
resign
.
###
``
In
the
next
few

I
will
be

best
way
of

said
Mr.
Garcia
,
56
years

.
###
Mrs.
Garcia
,
49
,
formerly
was
a
member
of
Mr.

The

FIVE
SHEA
&
GOULD
PARTNERS
are
leaving
to
form
a
new
firm
.
###
The
new
firm
,
Hutton
Ingram
Yuzek
Gainen
Carroll
&
Bertolotti
,
will
be
based
in
New
York
.
###
The
five
partners
who
resigned
from
Shea
&
Gould
late
last
week
are
Tom
Hutton
,
Sam
Ingram
,
Dean
Yuzek
,
Daniel
Carroll
and
Ernest
Bertolotti
.
###
They
will
be
joined
by
Larry
Gainen
,
who
resigned
from
the
firm
of
LePatner
,
Gainen
&
Block
.
###
Howard
Rubenstein
,
a
New
York
publicist
who
represents
Shea
&
Gould
,
said
,
``
Shea
&
Gould
understands
they
're
leaving
because
they
wanted
a
different
environment
--
a
smaller
firm
they
would
be
principals
of
.
''
###
Mr.
Rubenstein
said
the
five
,
who
were
n't
on
Shea
&
Gould
's
management
committee
,
``
are
leaving
on
good
terms
.
''
###
He
said
Shea
&
Gould
held
a
number
of
discussions
with
the
five
partners
during
the
past
few
weeks
to
get
them
to
stay
but
that
the
five
were
firmly
committed
to
running
their
own
firm
.
###
Hutton
Ingram
will
have
a
general
corporate
,
securities
,
real-estate
and
litigation
practice
,
and
a
substantial
practice
serving
the
professional-design
community

DISCIPLINARY
PROCEEDINGS
against
lawyers
open
to
public
in
Illinois
.
###
While
investigations
into
lawyer
misconduct
will
remain
secret
,
the
public
will
be
notified
once
a
formal
complaint
is
filed
against
an
attorney
.
###
The
actual
disciplinary
hearings
will
be
public
.
###
In
addition
,
Illinois
attorneys
will
lose
the
right
to
sue
clients
who
file
malicious
complaints
against
them
.
###
Non-lawyers
will
be
added
to
the
inquiry
panels
that
look
into
allegations
of
misconduct
.
###
Illinois
joins
36
other
states
that
allow
public
participation
in
attorney-disciplinary
proceedings
and
32
states
that
open
disciplinary
hearings
to
the
public
,
according
to
the
American
Bar
Association
.
###
One
vocal
critic
of
the
changes
,
Chicago
lawyer
Warren
Lupel
,
says
non-lawyers
should
n't
be
on
the
inquiry
panels
because
they
are
unlikely
to
appreciate
the
nuances
of
attorney-client
relationships
.
###
In
addition
,
he
says
,
publishing
the
names
of
lawyers
who
are
facing
charges
unnecessarily
subjects
them
to
public
derogation
.
###
Nevertheless
,
Mr.
Lupel
anticipates
no
legal
action
to
reverse
the
Illinois
Supreme
Court
's
decision
to
institute
the
changes
.
###
``
There
's
no
constitutional
right
involved
in
the
rule
change
,
''
he
says
.
###
``
You
do
n't
have
a
right
to
practice
.
###
You
only
have
a
privilege
to
practice
.

DREXEL
BURNHAM
LAMBERT
Inc.
agreed
to
pay
a
$
50,000
fine
to
Delaware
,
the
26th
state
to
settle
with
Drexel
in
the
wake
of
the
firm
's
guilty
plea
to
federal
insider-trading
charges
.
###
Drexel
does
n't
have
a
Delaware
office
,
but
the
New
York
firm
has
been
negotiating
settlements
that
would
allow
it
to
operate
freely
nationwide
despite
its
record
as
an
admitted
felon
.
###
The
firm
has
said
it
expects
to
pay
$
11.5
million
overall
to
settle
with
states
.
###
Drexel
pleaded
guilty
in
September
to
six
felony
counts
of
securities
and
mail
fraud
;
it
also
made
a
$
650
million
civil
settlement
with
the
Securities
and
Exchange
Commission
.
###
Philip
Morris
Cos.
,
whose
Benson
&
Hedges
cigarette
brand
has
been
losing
market
share
,
has
asked
at
least
one
other
agency
to
try
its
hand
at
creative
work
for
the
big
account
,
which
has
been
at
Wells
Rich
Greene
Inc.
since
1966
.
###
Executives
close
to
Philip
Morris
said
that
the
tobacco
and
food
giant
has
asked
Backer
Spielvogel
Bates
Worldwide
Inc.
,
a
unit
of
Saatchi
&
Saatchi
Co.
,
and
possibly
others
to
work
on
creative
ideas
for
the
account
.
###
Several
executives
said
another
potential
contender
is
WPP
Group
's
Ogilvy
&
Mather
agency
,
which
works
on
some
other
Philip
Morris
products
.
###
Both
Philip
Morris
and
Backer
Spielvogel
declined
to
comment
.
###
A
spokeswoman
for
Ogilvy
&
Mather
said
the
agency
does
n't
comment
on
``
idle
speculation
.
''
###
Also
mentioned
as
a
contender
was
TBWA
Advertising
,
but
the
company
denied
it
was
participating
.
###
The
loss
of
the
cigarette
account
would
be
a
severe
blow
to
Wells
Rich
.
###
Benson
&
Hedges
has
been
one
of
its
most
high-visibility
campaigns
,
as
well
as
one
of
its
largest
clients
.
###
The
account
billed
almost
$
60
million
last
year
,
according
to
Leading
National
Advertisers
.
###
But
Philip
Morris
has
scaled
back
ad
spending
on
the
brand
over
the
past
year
,
industry
executives
said
,
and
it
now
bills
about
$
30
million
to
$
40
million
.
###
Industry
executives
said
Philip
Morris
had
asked
the
other
agencies
to
create
campaigns
in
a
bid
to
stop
the
brand
's
slipping
market
share
.
###
According
to
John
Maxwell
,
an
analyst
at
Wheat
First
Securities
,
Richmond
,
Va.
,
Benson
&
Hedges
has
slipped
from
4.7
%
of
the
cigarette
market
in
1985
to
just
4.1
%
after
the
second
quarter
of
this
year
.
###
The
brand
is
No.
7
overall
in
the
cigarette
business
,
Mr.
Maxwell
said
.
###
The
slip
has
come
despite
high-profile
ads
created
by
Wells
Rich
,
including
one
picturing
a
young
man
clad
only
in
pajama
bottoms
interrupting
a
festive
brunch
.
###
That
ad
generated
so
much
publicity
that
a
trade
magazine
launched
a
contest
for
its
readers
to
guess
who
the
guy
was
and
what
he
was
doing
.
###
Wells
Rich
first
popularized
the
Benson
&
Hedges
brand
more
than
20
years
ago
with
ads
portraying
,
among
other
things
,
an
elevator
door
closing
on
a
passenger
's
cigarette
.
###
The
brand
early
on
achieved
an
upscale
appeal
--
a
trait
that
some
analysts
believe
is
partly
responsible
for
its
staid
performance
.
###
Philip
Morris
,
trying
to
revive
the
Benson
&
Hedges
franchise
,
put
the
account
up
for
review
in
1986
.
###
Wells
Rich
Greene
,
however
,
in
an
effort
directed
by
Mary
Wells
Lawrence
,
emerged
the
victor
of
the
review
and
retained
the
business
.
###
Kenneth
Olshan
,
Wells
Rich
's
chairman
,
did
n't
return
phone
calls
seeking
comment
.
###
While
Wells
Rich
recently
picked
up
Hertz
Corp.
's
$
25
million
to
$
30
million
account
,
it
has
lost
a
number
of
big
accounts
this
year
,
including
the
$
20
million
to
$
25
million
Cadbury-Schweppes
Canada
Dry
and
Sunkist
accounts
,
the
$
18
million
Procter
&
Gamble
Co
.
Sure
deodorant
account
and
the
$
10
million
Lauren
business
.
###
Its
victories
include
more
than
$
30
million
in
Sheraton
Corp.
business
and
an
assignment
from
Dun
&
Bradstreet
worth
$
5
million
to
$
10
million
.
###
This
city
is
girding
for
gridlock
today
as
hundreds
of
thousands
of
commuters
avoid
travel
routes
ravaged
by
last
week
's
earthquake
.
###
Estimates
of
damage
in
the
six-county
San
Francisco
Bay
area
neared
$
5
billion
,
excluding
the
cost
of
repairing
the
region
's
transportation
system
.
###
The
Bay
Bridge
,
the
main
artery
into
San
Francisco
from
the
east
,
will
be
closed
for
at
least
several
weeks
.
###
Part
of
the
bridge
collapsed
in
the
quake
,
which
registered
6.9
on
the
Richter
scale
.
###
The
bridge
normally
carries
250,000
commuters
a
day
.
###
Also
,
most
of
the
ramps
connecting
the
city
to
its
main
link
to
the
south
,
the
101
freeway
,
have
been
closed
for
repairs
.
###
The
Bay
Area
Rapid
Transit
system
,
which
runs
subway
trains
beneath
the
bay
,
is
braced
for
a
doubling
of
its
daily
regular
ridership
to
300,000
.
###
BART
has
increased
service
to
24
hours
a
day
in
preparation
for
the
onslaught
.
###
Most
unusual
will
be
water-borne
commuters
from
the
East
Bay
towns
of
Oakland
and
Berkeley
.
###
For
the
first
time
in
32
years
,
ferry
service
has
been
restored
between
the
East
Bay
and
San
Francisco
.
###
The
Red
and
White
Fleet
,
which
operates
regular
commuter
ferry
service
to
and
from
Marin
County
,
and
tourist
tours
of
the
bay
,
is
offering
East
Bay
commuters
a
chance
to
ride
the
waves
for
the
price
of
$
10
round-trip
.
###
That
tariff
is
too
stiff
for
some
Financial
District
wage
earners
.
###
``
I
'll
stay
with
BART
,
''
said
one
secretary
,
swallowing
her
fears
about
using
the
transbay
tube
.
###
Officials
expect
the
Golden
Gate
Bridge
to
be
swamped
with
an
extra
load
of
commuters
,
including
East
Bay
residents
making
a
long
detour
.
###
``
We
're
anticipating
quite
a
traffic
crunch
,
''
said
one
official
.
###
About
23,000
people
typically
travel
over
the
Golden
Gate
Bridge
during
commute
hours
.
###
About
130,000
vehicles
cross
during
a
24-hour
period
.
###
Meetings
canceled
by
Apple
Computer
Inc.
's
European
sales
force
and
by
other
groups
raised
the
specter
of
empty
hotel
rooms
and
restaurants
.
###
It
also
raised
hackles
of
the
city
's
tourism
boosters
.
###
``
Other
cities
are
calling
-LCB-
groups
booked
here
for
tours
and
conferences
-RCB-
and
--
not
to
be
crass
--
stealing
our
booking
list
,
''
said
Scott
Shafer
,
a
spokesman
for
Mayor
Art
Agnos
.
###
City
officials
stuck
by
their
estimate
of
$
2
billion
in
damage
to
the
quake-shocked
city
.
###
The
other
five
Bay
area
counties
have
increased
their
total
damage
estimates
to
$
2.8
billion
.
###
All
estimates
exclude
highway
repair
,
which
could
exceed
$
1
billion
.
###
Among
the
expensive
unknowns
are
stretches
of
elevated
freeway
in
San
Francisco
that
were
closed
because
of
quake-inflicted
damage
.
###
The
most
worrisome
stretch
is
1.2
miles
of
waterfront
highway
known
as
the
Embarcadero
Freeway
.
###
Until
it
was
closed
Tuesday
,
it
had
provided
the
quickest
series
of
exits
for
commuters
from
the
Bay
Bridge
heading
into
the
Financial
District
.
###
Engineers
say
it
will
take
at
least
eight
months
to
repair
the
Embarcadero
structure
.
###
As
part
of
the
quake
recovery
effort
,
the
city
Building
Department
has
surveyed
about
3,000
buildings
,
including
all
of
the
Financial
District
's
high-rises
.
###
The
preliminary
conclusion
from
a
survey
of
200
downtown
high-rises
is
that
``
we
were
incredibly
lucky
,
''
said
Lawrence
Kornfield
,
San
Francisco
's
chief
building
inspector
.
###
While
many
of
these
buildings
sustained
heavy
damage
,
little
of
that
involved
major
structural
damage
.
###
City
building
codes
require
construction
that
can
resist
temblors
.
###
In
England
,
Martin
Leach

a

said
the

market
has
n't
yet
been
able
to
estimate
the
total
potential
claims
from

``
The

Mr.

On
Friday
,
during
a
visit
to
California
to
survey
quake
damage
,
President
Bush
promised
to
``
meet
the
federal
government
's
obligation
''
to
assist
relief
efforts
.
###
California
officials
plan
to
ask
Congress
for
$
3
billion
or
more
of
federal
aid
,
in
the
form
of
grants
and
low-interest
loans
.
###
The
state
has
a
$
1
billion
reserve
,
and
is
expected
to
add
$
1
billion
to
that
fund
in
the
next
year
.
###
Some
of
that
money
will
be
available
for
highway
repair
and
special
emergency
aid
,
but
members
of
the
legislature
are
also
mulling
over
a
temporary
state
gasoline
tax
to
raise
money
for
earthquake
relief
.
###
However
,
state
initiatives
restrict
the
ability
of
the
legislature
to
raise
such
taxes
unless
the
voters
approve
in
a
statewide
referendum
.

But
the

###
Bond

has
interests
in

,

communications
,
natural
resources
and

.
###
Much
of
Bond
Corp.
's
losses
stemmed
from
one-time
write-downs
of
the
value
of
some
of
Bond
Corp.
's
assets
and
those
of
its
units
.
###
The
results
included
a
A$
453.4

write-off
of
future
income-tax
benefits
and
a
provision
for
a
loss
of
A$

on
the

of
a

of
about
20

was
``

###

's
shares
closed
Friday
before
news
of
the

at
28
Australian

up
one
Australian

.
###
The
staggering
losses
cap
a
tumultuous
year
for
Alan
Bond
and
his
flagship
,
Bond
Corp
.
###
Only
a
year
ago
,
the
chairman
of
Bond
Corp.
,
who
controls
about
58
%
of
the
company
,
appeared
to
be
building
a
war
chest
to
attack
some
big
companies
.
###
Now
Bond
Corp.
has
agreed
to
sell
at
least
half
its
Australian
brewing
assets
.
###
It
has
sold
billions
of
dollars
of
other
assets
and
has
more
on
the
block
.
###
But
in
a
TV
interview
Sunday
Mr.
Bond
said
,
``
We
've
taken
a
big
loss
.
###
We
've
taken
it
on
the
chin
.
###
But
we
're
out
there
and
we
're
going
to
stay
in
business
.
###
Bond
Corp.
signaled
it
will
focus
on
building
its
domestic
and
international
media
and
communications
businesses
.
###
It
said
it
will
look
at
opportunities
in
brewing
,
property
and
energy
resources
to
the
extent
consistent
with
the
dominant
objective
of
manageable
debt-to-assets
ratios
.
###
The
result
``
will
ultimately
be
a
very
different
group
in
size
and
structure
,
''
Bond
Corp.
directors
said
in
a
statement
.
###
Some
analysts
contend
the
total
writeoffs
should
have
been
much
greater
,
and
Bond
Corp.
's
auditors
cited
a
list
of
several
assets
and
deals
about
which
there
is
``
uncertainty
''
regarding
the
current
value
and
potential
impact
on
the
firm
.
###
Bond
Corp.
said
the
acknowledged
losses
mean
net
asset
backing
is
in
the
red
to
the
tune
of
53
Australian
cents
a
share
,
vs.
positive
asset
backing
of
A$
1.92
a
share
a
year
ago
.
###
Still
,
the
directors
said
,
``
Having
fully
considered
all
aspects
of
the
company
's
state
of
affairs
and
future
cash
flows
,
the
directors
confirm
absolutely
that
the
company
is
solvent
.
''
###
Indeed
,
in
a
note
to
the
results
,
directors
said
if
the
``
true
worth
''
of
some
of
the
group
's
assets
were
taken
into
account
instead
of
using
book
values
,
the
negative
net
asset
backing
a
share
would
turn
into
``
a
substantial
positive
''
one
.
###
The
Bakersfield
Supermarket
went
out
of
business
last
May
.
###
The
reason
was
not
high
interest
rates
or
labor
costs
.
###
Nor
was
there
a
shortage
of
customers
in
the
area
,
the
residential
Inwood
section
of
northern
Manhattan
.
###
The
business
closed
when
the
owner
was
murdered
by
robbers
.
###
The
owner
was
Israel
Ortiz
,
a
29-year-old
entrepreneur
and
father
of
two
.
###
In
his
first
year
of
operating
the
store
he
bought
for
$
220,000
,
Mr.
Ortiz
was
robbed
at
least
twice
at
gunpoint
.
###
The
first
time
he
was
shot
in
the
hand
as
he
chased
the
robbers
outside
.
###
The
second
time
he
identified
two
robbers
,
who
were
arrested
and
charged
.
###
Two
weeks
later
--
perhaps
in
retaliation
--
Mr.
Ortiz
was
shot
three
times
in
the
back
,
during
what
police
classified
as
a
third
robbery
attempt
.
###
That
was
his
reward
for
working
until
11
p.m.
seven
days
a
week
to
cover
his
$
3,000
a
month
rent
.
###
For
providing
what
his
customers
described
as
very
personal
and
helpful
service
.
###
For
creating
a
focus
for
neighborhood
life
.
###
Israel
Ortiz
is
only
one
of
the
thousands
of
entrepreneurs
and
their
employees
who
will
be
injured
or
killed
by
crime
this
year
.
###
The
U.S.
Bureau
of
Justice
Statistics
reports
that
almost
2
%
of
all
retail-sales
workers
suffer
injuries
from
crime
each
year
,
almost
twice
the
national
average
and
about
four
times
the
rate
for
teachers
,
truck
drivers
,
medical
workers
and
door-to-door
salespeople
.
###
Only
a
few
other
occupations
have
higher
reported
rates
of
criminal
injury
,
such
as
police
,
bartenders
and
taxi
drivers
.
###
Yet
these
figures
show
only
the
most
visible
part
of
the
problem
.
###
Recent
data
from
New
York
City
provide
more
of
the
picture
.
###
While
by
no
means
the
highest
crime
community
in
the
country
,
New
York
is
a
prime
example
of
a
city
where
crime
strangles
small-business
development
.
###
A
survey
of
small
businesses
there
was
conducted
this
spring
by
Interface
,
a
policy
research
organization
.
###
It
gave
1,124
businesses
a
questionnaire
and
analyzed
353
responses
.
###
The
survey
found
that
over
a
three-year
period
22
%
of
the
firms
said
employees
or
owners
had
been
robbed
on
their
way
to
or
from
work
or
while
on
the
job
.
###
Seventeen
percent
reported
their
customers
being
robbed
.
###
Crime
was
the
reason
that
26
%
reported
difficulty
recruiting
personnel
and
that
19
%
said
they
were
considering
moving
.
###
More
than
one-third
of
the
responding
businesses
said
they
suffer
from
drug
dealing
and
loitering
near
their
premises
.
###
In
Brooklyn
and
the
Bronx
,
one
out
of
four
commercial
firms
is
burglarized
each
year
.
###
Industrial
neighborhoods
fare
even
worse
,
with
burglary
rates
twice
the
citywide
average
.
###
Crime
is
clearly
more
deadly
to
small-scale
entrepreneurship
than
to
big
businesses
.
###
Two
decades
ago
,
the
Small
Business
Administration
reported
Yale
Prof.
Albert
Reiss
's
landmark
study
of
crime
against
2,500
small
businesses
drawn
from
national
IRS
records
.
###
He
found
that
monetary
crime
losses
,
as
a
proportion
of
gross
receipts
,
were
37
times
higher
for
small
businesses
than
for
large
ones
.
###
The
New
York
study
's
companies
averaged
27
employees
;
their
annual
crime
losses
averaged
about
$
15,000
,
with
an
additional
$
8,385
annual
cost
in
security
--
enough
money
to
hire
at
least
one
more
worker
.
###
The
costs
of
crime
may
also
be
enough
to
destroy
a
struggling
business
.
###
Whatever
the
monetary
crime
losses
,
they
may
not
be
nearly
as
important
to
entrepreneurs
as
the
risk
of
personal
injury
.
###
After
repeated
gun
robberies
,
some
entrepreneurs
may
give
up
a
business
out
of
fear
for
their
lives
.
###
One
Washington
couple
recently
sold
their
liquor
store
after
34
years
in
business
that
included
four
robbery
deaths
and
16
robberies
or
burglaries
on
the
premises
.
###
These
findings
illustrate
the
vicious
cycle
that
National
Institute
of
Justice
Director
James
K.
Stewart
calls
``
crime
causing
poverty
.
''
###
Underclass
neighborhoods
offer
relatively
few
employment
opportunities
,
contributing
to
the
poverty
of
local
residents
.
###
Small
neighborhood
businesses
could
provide
more
jobs
,
if
crime
were
not
so
harmful
to
creating
and
maintaining
those
businesses
.
###
This
may
help
explain
why
small
businesses
create
65
%
of
all
jobs
nationally
,
but
only
22
%
of
jobs
in
a
crime-ridden
city
like
New
York
.
###
Bigger
business
can
often
better
afford
to
minimize
the
cost
of
crime
.
###
The
New
York
study
found
that
the
cost
of
security
measures
in
firms
with
fewer
than
five
employees
was
almost
$
1,000
per
worker
,
compared
with
one-third
that
amount
for
firms
with
more
than
10
employees
.
###
The
shift
of
retailing
to
large
shopping
centers
has
created
even
greater
economies
of
scale
for
providing
low-crime
business
environments
.
###
Private
security
guards
and
moonlighting
police
can
invoke
the
law
of
trespass
to
regulate
access
to
these
quasi-public
places
.
###
Since
1984
,
in
fact
,
revenues
of
the
10
largest
guard
companies
,
primarily
serving
such
big
businesses
,
have
increased
by
almost
62
%
.
###
Few
small
neighborhood
businesses
,
however
,
can
afford
such
protection
,
even
in
collaboration
with
other
local
merchants
.
###
In
the
neighborhoods
with
the
highest
crime
rates
,
small
business
generally
relies
on
the
public
police
force
for
protection
.
###
This
creates
several
problems
.
###
One
is
that
there
are
not
enough
police
to
satisfy
small
businesses
.
###
The
number
one
proposal
for
reducing
crime
in
the
New
York
survey
was
to
put
more
police
on
foot
or
scooter
patrol
,
suggested
by
more
than
two-thirds
of
the
respondents
.
###
Only
22
%
supported
private
security
patrols
funded
by
the
merchants
themselves
.
###
A
second
problem
is
the
persistent
frustration
of
false
alarms
,
which
can
make
urban
police
less
than
enthusiastic
about
responding
to
calls
from
small
businesses
.
###
Only
half
the
New
York
small
businesses
surveyed
,
for
their
part
,
are
satisfied
with
the
police
response
they
receive
.
###
Some
cities
,
including
New
York
,
have
experimented
with
special
tax
districts
for
commercial
areas
that
provide
additional
patrols
funded
by
local
businesses
.
###
But
this
raises
added
cost
barriers
to
urban
entrepreneurship
.
###
Another
solution
cities
might
consider
is
giving
special
priority
to
police
patrols
of
small-business
areas
.
###
For
cities
losing
business
to
suburban
shopping
centers
,
it
may
be
a
wise
business
investment
to
help
keep
those
jobs
and
sales
taxes
within
city
limits
.
###
Increased
patrolling
of
business
zones
makes
sense
because
urban
crime
is
heavily
concentrated
in
such
``
hot
spots
''
of
pedestrian
density
.
###
With
National
Institute
of
Justice
support
,
the
Minneapolis
police
and
the
Crime
Control
Institute
are
currently
testing
the
effects
of
such
a
strategy
,
comparing
its
deterrence
value
with
traditional
random
patrols
.
###
Small-business
patrols
would
be
an
especially
helpful
gesture
whenever
a
small-business
person
is
scheduled
to
testify
against
a
robbery
suspect
.
###
While
no
guarantee
,
an
increased
police
presence
might
even
deter
further
attacks
.
###
It
might
even
have
saved
the
life
,
and
business
,
of
Israel
Ortiz
.

US$
47.7

closed

Diversification
pays
.
###
That
's
a
fundamental
lesson
for
investors
,
but
its
truth
was
demonstrated
once
again
in
the
performance
of
mutual
funds
during
and
after
the
stock
market
's
Friday-the-13th
plunge
.
###
Stock

generally
dropped
more
than
2
%
in
the
week
through
last
Thursday
,
according
to
figures
compiled

That
reflects
the
huge

the

that
followed

###
General
equity
funds
fell
an
average
of
2.35
%
in
the
week
ended
Thursday
,
compared
with
a
2.32
%
slide
for
the
Standard
&
Poor
's
500-stock
index
.
###
But
Lipper
Analytical
's
figures
show
that
there
were
a
number
of
ways
investors
could
have
cushioned
themselves
from
the
stock
market
's
gyrations
.
###
Gold-oriented
funds
,
for
instance
,
which
invest
in
companies
that
mine
and
process
the
precious
metal
,
posted
an
average
decline
of
1.15
%
.
###
Flexible
portfolio
funds
,
which
allocate
investments
among
stocks
,
bonds
and
money-market
instruments
and
other
investments
,
declined
at
about
half
the
rate
of
stock
funds
--
an
average
drop
of
1.27
%
,
according
to
Lipper
.
###
Global
allocation
funds
take
the
asset-allocation
concept
one
step
further
by
investing
at
least
25
%
of
their
portfolios
outside
the
U.S
.
###
This
gives
them
the
added
benefits
of
international
diversification
--
including
a
foreign-exchange
boost
during
periods
,
like
the
past
week
,
when
the
dollar
declines
against
other
major
currencies
.
###
With
all
that
going
for
them
,
global
flexible
portfolio
funds
declined
only
1.07
%
in
the
week
through
last
Thursday
.
###
But
while
the
merits
of
diversification
shine
through
when
times
are
tough
,
there
's
also
a
price
to
pay
:
A
diversified
portfolio
always
underperforms
an
undiversified
portfolio
during
those
times
when
the
investment
in
the
undiversified
portfolio
is
truly
hot
.
###
And
Friday
the
13th
notwithstanding
,
stocks
have
been
this
year
's
hot
investment
.
###
Thus
,
even
including
the
latest
week
,
the
average
general
stock
fund
has
soared
more
than
24
%
so
far
this
year
,
the
Lipper
Analytical
figures
show
.
###
By
comparison
,
global
asset
allocation
funds
have
turned
in
an
average
total
return
of
about
19
%
,
while
domestic
flexible
portfolios
are
up
about
17
%
.
###
Fixed-income
funds
have
returned
8.2
%
,
while
gold
funds
,
which
tend
to
be
volatile
,
have
risen
just
4.55
%
,
on
average
.
###
``
That
's
the
problem
with
trying
to
hedge
too
much
,
''
said
Mr.
Brouwer
.
###
You
do
n't
make
any
real
money
.
''
###
Over
the
last
20
years
,
for
example
,
Mr.
Brouwer
says
,
an
investor
putting
$
5,000
a
year
in
the
S&P
500
would
have
made
nearly
twice
as
much
than
if
it
were
invested
in
Treasury
bills
.
###
Some
equity
funds
did
better
than
others
in
the
week
that
began
on
Friday
the
13th
.
###
The
$
4
million
Monetta
Fund
,
for
instance
,
was
the
seventh
top
performing
fund
for
the
week
,
with
a
2.65
%
return
.
###
Its
return
so
far
this
year
has
been
a
credible
21.71
%
.
###
The
fund
's
strategy
is
to
sell
when
a
stock
appreciates
30
%
over
its
cost
.
###
By
the
time
the
market
plummeted
10
days
ago
,
Monetta
was
55
%
in
cash
,
said
Robert
Bacarella
,
president
and
portfolio
manager
.
###
Last
Monday
,
he
started
``
buying
the
high-quality
growth
companies
that
people
were
throwing
away
at
discount
prices
.
''
###
Among
Mr.
Bacarella
's
picks
:
Oracle
Systems
,
Reebok
International
Ltd.
and
Digital
Microwave
Corp
.
###
The
fund
's
cash
position
is
now
about
22
%
,
which
Mr.
Bacarella
calls
``
still
bearish
.
''
###
Among
the
big
stock
funds
,
Dreyfus
Fund
,
with
more
than
$
2
billion
in
assets
,
had
a
decline
of
just
1.49
%
for
the
week
and
a
return
of
21.42
%
for
the
year
.
###
Howard
Stein
,
chairman
of
Dreyfus
Corp.
,
said
the
fund
was
about
half
invested
in
government
bonds
on
Oct.
13
,
and
about
10
%
in
cash
.
###
``
In
a
downward
market
,
bonds
act
better
,
''
he
said
.
###
``
We
still
think
there
's
a
lot
of
unsettlement
in
this
market
.
###
We
believe
interest
rates
will
continue
to
trend
lower
,
and
the
economy
will
slow
around
the
world
.
''
###
Many
of
the
funds
that
did
best
in
the
last
week
are
heavily
invested
overseas
,
giving
them
the
benefit
of
foreign
currency
translations
when
the
dollar
is
weak
.
###
From
its
high
point
on
Thursday
,
Oct.
12
,
to
where
it
traded
late
in
New
York
a
week
later
,
the
dollar
fell
3.6
%
against
the
West
German
mark
,
3.4
%
against
the
British
pound
and
2.1
%
against
the
Japanese
yen
.
###
Three
International
Cash
Portfolios
funds
,
which
invest
almost
exclusively
in
bonds
and
money-market
instruments
overseas
,
were
among
the
four
top-performing
funds
in
the
latest
week
.
###
Because
the
funds
'
investments
are
denominated
in
foreign
currencies
,
their
value
expressed
in
dollars
goes
up
when
those
currencies
rise
against
the
dollar
.
###
But
when
the
dollar
rises
against
major
foreign
currencies
,
as
it
did
for
much
of
this
year
,
the
dollar
value
of
these
funds
declines
.
###
All
three
funds
posted
negative
returns
for
the
year
to
date
.
###
Of
the
funds
that
fared
the
worst
in
the
post-Oct
.
13
week
,
two
are
heavily
invested
in
airlines
stocks
,
which
led
the
market
slide
following
problems
with
financing
for
the
UAL
Corp
.
buy-out
plan
.
###
Reflecting
airline
takeover
activity
,
however
,
both
the
Fidelity
Select
Air
Transportation
Portfolio
and
the
National
Aviation
&
Technology
fund
posted
better-than-average
returns
for
the
the
year
to
date
:
30.09
%
for
the
Fidelity
Air
Transportation
fund
and
a
whopping
47.24
%
for
National
Aviation
&
Technology
.
###
The
small
drop
in
equity
funds
in
general
in
the
latest
week
may
not
necessarily
be
a
good
sign
,
said
A.
Michael
Lipper
,
president
of
Lipper
Analytical
.
###
Noting
that
equity
funds
are
up
nearly
60
%
from
their
post-crash
low
on
Dec.
3
,
1987
,
he
said
that
what
happened
last
week
``
may
not
be
enough
of
an
adjustment
.
###
There
's
either
more
to
come
or
an
extremely
long
period
of
dullness
.
''
###
But
investors
do
n't
seem
to
think
so
.
###
Several
big
mutual
fund
groups
said
last
week
that
cash
flows
into
stock
funds
were
heavier
than
usual
after
heavy
outflows
on
the
13th
.
###
Vanguard
Group
said
it
had
a
more
than
$
50
million
net
inflow
into
its
stock
funds
last
week
.
###
``
There
certainly
has
n't
been
a
panic
reaction

said
Steven
Norwitz
,
a
vice
president
at
T.

business

the

Sitting
at
the
bar
of
the
Four
Seasons
restaurant
,
architect
William
McDonough
seems
oblivious
to
the
glamorous
clientele
and
the
elegant
setting
.
###
He
is
ogling
the
curtains
rippling
above
the
ventilation
ducts
.
###
``
Look
how
much
air
is
moving
around
''
he
says
.
###
``
The
ventilation
here
is
great
''
###
You
may
be
hearing
more
about
the
38-year-old
Mr.
McDonough
and
his
preoccupation
with
clean
air
.
###
After
years
of
relative
obscurity
,
he
is
starting
to
attract
notice
for
the
ecological
as
well
as
the
aesthetic
quality
of
his
architecture
.
###
Mr.
McDonough
believes
that
the
well-being
of
the
planet
depends
on
such
stratagems
as
opening
windows
to
cut
indoor
air
pollution
,
tacking
down
carpets
instead
of
using
toxic
glues
,
and
avoiding
mahogany
,
which
comes
from
endangered
rain
forests
.
###
He
has
put
some
of
his
aesthetic
ideas
into
practice
with
his
design
of
the
four-star
Quilted
Giraffe
restaurant
--
``
architecturally
impeccable
,
''
Progressive
Architecture
magazine
called
it
--
and
his
remodeling
of
Paul
Stuart
,
the
Madison
Avenue
clothing
store
.
###
He
has
designed
furniture
and
homes
as
well
as
commercial
and
office
space
.
###
He
is
now
designing
a
Broadway
stage
set
for
a
show
by
the
band
Kid
Creole
and
the
Coconuts
.
###
What
really
stirs
his
muse
,
though
,
is
aerobic
architecture
.
###
Now
the
question
is
:
Is
Poland
ready
for
it
?
###
Mr.
McDonough
is
about
to
tackle
his
biggest
clean-air
challenge
yet
,
the
proposed
Warsaw
Trade
Center
in
Poland
,
the
first
such
center
in
Eastern
Europe
.
###
The
project
has
already
acquired
a
certain
New
York
cachet
.
###
Bloomingdale
's
plans
to
sell
a
foot-tall
chocolate
model
of
the
center
during
the
holidays
.
###
Some
of
the
sales
proceeds
will
go
to
the
Design
Industries
Foundation
for
AIDS
.
###
A
cake
topped
with
a
replica
of
the
center
will
be
auctioned
at
an
AIDS
benefit
at
Sotheby
's
in
December
.
###
If
Mr.
McDonough
's
plans
get
executed
,
as
much
of
the
Polish
center
as
possible
will
be
made
from
aluminum
,
steel
and
glass
recycled
from
Warsaw
's
abundant
rubble
.
###
A
20-story
mesh
spire
will
stand
atop
50
stories
of
commercial
space
.
###
Solar-powered
batteries
will
make
the
spire
glow
.
###
The
windows
will
open
.
###
The
carpets
wo
n't
be
glued
down
,
and
walls
will
be
coated
with
nontoxic
finishes
.
###
To
the
extent
that
the
$
150
million
budget
will
allow
it
,
Mr.
McDonough
will
rely
on
solid
wood
,
rather
than
plywood
or
particle
board
,
to
limit
the
emission
of
formaldehyde
.
###
If
Mr.
McDonough
has
his
way
,
the
Poles
will
compensate
for
the
trade
center
's
emissions
of
carbon
dioxide
,
a
prime
suspect
in
the
global
atmospheric
warming
many
scientists
fear
.
###
The
Poles
would
plant
a
10-square-mile
forest
somewhere
in
the
country
at
a
cost
of
$
150,000
,
with
the
center
's
developer
footing
the
bill
.
###
The
news
has
n't
exactly
moved
others
in
Mr.
McDonough
's
profession
to
become
architectural
Johnny
Appleseeds
.
###
All
architects
want
to
be
aware
of
the
ecological
consequences
of
their
work
,
says
John
Burgee
,
whose
New
York
firm
is
designing
the
redevelopment
of
Times
Square
,
``
but
we
ca
n't
all
carry
it
to
that
extreme
.
''
###
Karen
Nichols
,
senior
associate
at
Michael
Graves
's
architecture
firm
in
Princeton
,
N.J.
,
says
:
``
We
're
really
at
the
mercy
of
what
the
construction
industry
can
and
will
do
readily
.
''
###
Mr.
McDonough
responds
:
``
I
'm
asking
people
to
broaden
their
agendas
.
''
###
The
son
of
a
Seagram
's
executive
who
was
stationed
in
many
countries
around
the
world
,
Mr.
McDonough
was
born
in
Tokyo
and
attended
19
schools
in
places
ranging
from
Hong
Kong
to
Shaker
Heights
,
Ohio
,
before
entering
Dartmouth
College
.
###
He
earned
a
master
's
degree
in
architecture
from
Yale
.
###
His
interest
in
the
natural
environment
dates
from
his
youth
.
###
He
and
his
father
still
spend
time
each
summer
fly-fishing
for
salmon
in
Iceland
.
###
Living
in
Hong
Kong
,
he
says
,
made
him
sensitive
to
the
limits
on
food
,
power
and
water
supplies
.
###
At
his
first
school
in
the
U.S.
he
was
thought
a
little
strange
for
shutting
off
open
water
taps
and
admonishing
his
schoolmates
to
take
only
brief
showers
.
###
He
and
a
Dartmouth
roommate
established
a
company
that
restored
three
hydroelectric
power
plants
in
Vermont
.
###
At
Yale
,
he
designed
one
of
the
first
solarheated
houses
to
be
built
in
Ireland
.
###
Mr.
McDonough
's
first
professional
project
fully
to
reflect
his
environmental
ardor
was
his
1986
design
for
the
headquarters
of
the
Environmental
Defense
Fund
in
New
York
.
###
The
offices
took
10,000
square
feet
of
a
building
with
14-foot
ceilings
and
big
,
operable
windows
.
###
Since
the
1970s
energy
crisis
,
some
efforts
to
conserve
energy
by
sealing
buildings
have
had
an
unintended
side
effect
:
high
indoor
pollution
.
###
To
reduce
it
at
the
fund
's
building
,
workers
rubbed
beeswax
instead
of
polyurethane
on
the
floors
in
the
executive
director
's
office
.
###
Jute
,
rather
than
a
synthetic
material
,
lies
under
the
tacked-down
carpets
,
and
the
desks
are
of
wood
and
granite
instead
of
plastic
.
###
The
budget
was
only
$
400,000
.
###
``
Athens
with
Spartan
means
,
''
Mr.
McDonough
says
.
###
The
fund
's
lawyers
work
in
an
Athenian
grove
of
potted
trees
.
###
Economists
and
administrators
sit
along
a
``
boulevard
''
with
street
lamps
and
ficus
trees
.
###
In
offices
,
triphosphorous
bulbs
simulate
daylight
.
###
Offices
with
outside
windows
have
inside
windows
,
too
,
to
let
in
more
real
daylight
.
###
``
We
proved
a
healthy
office
does
n't
cost
more
,
''
says
Frederic
Krupp
,
executive
director
of
the
fund
.
###
It
``
really
looks
beautiful
and
is
very
light
,
''
says
Ann
Hornaday
,
a
free-lance
writer
who
has
visited
the
office
for
lunch
meetings
.
###
But
,
she
says
,
``
I
guess
I
did
n't
really
notice
the
trees
.
###
Maybe
they
were
hidden
by
all
the
people
.
''
###
Neither
the
Quilted
Giraffe
nor
the
Paul
Stuart
renovation
reflects
much
of
Mr.
McDonough
's
environmental
concern
.
###
The
restaurant
was
conceived
as
a
sparkling
,
crystalline
``
geode
.
''
###
It
makes
extensive
use
of
stainless
steel
,
silver
and
aluminum
that
sets
off
black
granite
table
tops
and
a
gray
terrazzo
with
zinc-strip
floors
.
###
To
more
than
replace
the
wood
from
two
English
oaks
used
for
paneling
at
Paul
Stuart
,
however
,
Mr.
McDonough
and
friends
planted
1,000
acorns
around
the
country
.
###
The
ambitious
Warsaw
project
still
awaits
approval
by
city
officials
.
###
Its
developer
is
a
Polish
American
,
Sasha
Muniak
.
###
He
had
worked
with
Mr.
McDonough
on
an
earlier
project
and
recruited
him
as
architect
for
the
trade
center
.
###
The
center
will
provide
space
for
computer
hardware
and
facsimile
and
other
telecommunications
equipment
,
not
readily
accessible
in
Poland
now
,
for
a
growing
number
of
Westerners
doing
business
in
Eastern
Europe
.
###
Mr.
McDonough
thinks
of
the
center
as
the
``
Eiffel

If

it
is
Poland

Jessica
Mathews
,
vice
president
of
World
Resources
Institute
in
Washington
,
D.C.
,
says
that
perhaps
a
quarter
of
Poland
's
soil
is
too
contaminated
for
safe
farming
because
of
air
pollution
.
###
The
pollution
is
also
killing
forests
and
destroying
buildings
that
date
back
to
the
Middle
Ages
.
###
The
future
of
the
forest
remains
uncertain

Mr.
Muniak
's
company
,
Balag
Ltd.
,
has
agreed
to
set
aside
the
money
to
plant
and
maintain
it
,
but
discussions
are
still
going
on
over
where
to
place
it
and
how
to
ensure
that
it
will
be
maintained
.
###
After
all
,
Mr.
Muniak
says
,
``
in
Poland
there
are
n't
too
many
people
worried
about
the
environment
.
###
They
're
more
worried
about
bread
on
the
table

###
Pittston
Co.
's
third-quarter
net
income
plunged
79
%
,
reflecting
the
impact
of
a
prolonged
and
bitter
labor
strike
at
its
coal
operations
.
###
Net
sank
to
$
3.1
million
,
or
eight
cents
a
share
,
including
$
789,000
,
or
two
cents
a
share
,
reflecting
a
tax-loss
carry-forward
.
###
In
the
year-ago
quarter
,
net
totaled
$
14.7
million
,
or
38
cents
a
share
,
including
$
4
million
,
or
10
cents
a
share
,
reflecting
a
tax-loss
carry-forward
.
###
Revenue
slipped
0.7
%
to
$
395.3
million
from
$
398.3
million
.
###
Pittston
also
owns
Brink
's
Inc.
,
the
security
service
,
and
Burlington
Air
Express
,
the
air-freight
concern
.
###
In
addition
to
expected
losses
tied
to
the
labor
strike
,
the
coal
group
has
spent
almost
$
20
million
since
the
strike
began
for
security
,
the
company
said
.
###
As
a
result
,
the
group
's
third-quarter
loss
widened
to
$
9.8
million
from
the
second
quarter
's
$
3.6
million
.
###
Pittston
continues
to
hire
replacement
workers
,
the
company
said
.
###
Burlington
's
operating
profit
grew
to
$
9.2
million
from
$
3.8
million
a
year
earlier
,
Pittston
said
.
###
While
``
the
tone
''
of
domestic
and
international
air-freight
markets
remains
sound
,
seasonal
factors
are
likely
to
hinder
Burlington
Air
from
matching
third-quarter
results
in
the
fourth
quarter
,
Pittston
said
.
###
Brink
's
operating
profit
was
about
flat
with
the
year-earlier
period
,
reflecting
continued
pricing
and
cost
pressures
.

In

###
Does
n't
anybody
here
want
to
win
this
mayor
's
race
?
###
As
they
stumble
and
bumble
toward
election
day
two
weeks
from
tomorrow
,
both
Democrat
David
Dinkins
and
Republican
Rudolph
Giuliani
are
in
trouble
.
###
Mr.
Dinkins
,
the
Manhattan
borough
president
,
can
afford
more
bumbling
and
stumbling
because
he
holds
a
comfortable
20-point
lead
in
most
of
the
public-opinion
polls
.
###
But
,
in
the
past
10
days
,
he
has
taken
a
series
of
body
blows
to
his
pride
and
his
reputation
that
could
adversely
affect
his
ability
to
govern
this
tumultuous
city
should
he
become
New
York
's
first
black
mayor
.
###
Ordinarily
,
a
clever
opponent
would
find
a
way
to
capitalize
on
the
other
side
's
misfortunes
.
###
But
Mr.
Giuliani
,
a
celebrated
prosecutor
,
has
had
difficulty
switching
from
his
crime-busting
,
finger-pointing
mode
to
a
political
stance
that
suggests
he
might
know
something
about
running
this
big
,
troubled
city
.
###
And
now
,
at
the
crucial
moment
,
he
's
running
out
of
money
.
###
This
is
the
nation
's
biggest
city
and
,
,
its
mayor
is
the
nation
's
best-known
urban
politician
.
###
Democrats
hoped
that
Mr.
Dinkins
could
become
a
highly
visible
national
leader
.
###
Republicans
figured
that
in
Mr.
Giuliani
,
the
nation
's
best-known
prosecutor
,
they
had
a
chance
for
a
huge
upset
in
the
heart
of
Democratic
territory
and
that
they
would
pick
up
a
new
political
star
.
###
But
it
has
n't
worked
out
that
way
.
###
``
Dinkins
is
a
decent
but
sloppy
guy
,
''
says
David
Garth
,
veteran
campaign
consultant
here
who
has
always
worked
for
Mayor
Edward
Koch
,
defeated
by
Mr.
Dinkins
in
the
Sept.
12
Democratic
primary
.
###
The
alternative
--
Giuliani
--
is
ghastly
.
''
###
``
I
guess
we
'll
reluctantly
go
ahead
and
do
it
,
vote
for
Dinkins
,
''
says
Richard
Wade
,
a
politically
active
professor
who
supported
Richard
Ravitch
,
an
also-ran
in
the
Democratic
primary
.
###
There
's
nothing
on
the
other
side
.
''
###
``
We
're
picking
up
steam
,
''
insists
Roger
Ailes
,
Mr.
Giuliani
's
media
consultant
,
whose
last
big
campaign
helped
put
George
Bush
in
the
White
House
.
###
He
adds
:
``
It
just
has
n't
gotten
down
to
the
engine
room
yet
.
''
###
But
the
steam
may
never
reach
the
engine
room
.
###
For
,
just
as
Mr.
Giuliani
latches
on
to
an
issue
that
has
Mr.
Dinkins
reeling
,
his
campaign
desperately
needs
cash
to
keep
Mr.
Ailes
's
commercials
on
the
air
beyond
Wednesday
or
Thursday
.
###
To
help
out
this
week
,
the
White
House
is
dispatching
chief
of
staff
John
Sununu
and
three
Cabinet
members
--
HUD
's
Jack
Kemp
,
Transportation
's
Samuel
Skinner
and
Treasury
's
Nicholas
Brady
,
according
to
Peter
Powers
,
the
Giuliani
campaign
manager
.
###
For
Republicans
who
began
this
campaign
with
such
high
hopes
,
all
of
this
is
deeply
frustrating
.
###
Historically
,
New
York
is
almost
always
in
trouble
.
###
But
the
trouble
it
faces
now
under
Democratic
rule
seems
bigger
and
more
daunting
than
anything
it
has
faced
in
the
past
.
###
This
year
,
the
city
faces
a
budget
deficit
that
could
become
even
bigger
next
year
.
###
And
hardly
surprising
,
many
residents
trying
to
cope
with
the
city
's
other
problems
are
constantly
on
edge
,
one
ethnic
group
scrapping
with
another
.
###
``
People
were
n't
so
happy
in
the
1930s
,
''
says
Thomas
Lessner
,
another
local
professor
and
the
biographer
of
the
legendary
Fiorello
LaGuardia
,
the
city
's
fusion
mayor
who
built
a
coalition
Mr.
Giuliani
hopes
to
emulate
.
###
But
,
at
least
,
back
then
they
did
n't
generally
direct
their
anger
at
each
other
.
''
###
The
62-year-old
Mr.
Dinkins
,
an
ex-Marine
,
has
served
as
the
city
clerk
and
as
Manhattan
borough
president
,
a
job
with
limited
executive
responsibilities
-LRB-
``
I
``
I
defy
you
to
come
up
with
one
major
accomplishment
of
David
Dinkins
,
''
says
Mr.
Giuliani
.
-RRB-
###
He
defeated
the
contentious
Mr.
Koch
in
the
Democratic
primary
partly
because
he
seemed
to
offer
hope
he
could
heal
the
city
's
racial
and
ethnic
wounds
.
###
His
general-election
campaign
is
almost
Reagan-like
,
all
muted
pictures
and
comforting
words
.
###
His
theme
is
unity
,
decency
,
humanity
,
bringing
New
York
together
again
.
###
Both
candidates
are
negotiating
about
holding
debates
,
but
Mr.
Dinkins
is
widely
seen
as
the
major
obstacle
for
scheduling
them
.
###
The
45-year-old
Mr.
Giuliani
has
run
a
negative
campaign
to
pick
up
votes
leaning
to
Mr.
Dinkins
.
###
``
He
's
got
to
get
Dinkins
's
negatives
up
,
''
says
Lee
Miringoff
,
director
of
the
Marist
College
Institute
of
Public
Opinion
.
###
``
But
our
polls
show
voters
do
n't
like
the
attack
stuff
.
###
Why
,
even
20
%
of
the
Republican
vote
is
going
to
Dinkins
.
''
###
``
It
's
assault-weapons
politics
,
''
says
John
Siegal
,
Mr.
Dinkins
's
issues
director
,
insisting
there
is
a
strong
racist
undertone
to
the
Giuliani
effort
.
###
For
the
Giuliani
forces
,
it
's
a
conundrum
.
###
On
the
one
hand
,
Mr.
Giuliani
wants
to
cut
into
Mr.
Dinkins
's
credibility
.
###
On
the
other
,
he
seeks
to
convince
voters
he
's
the
new
Fiorello
LaGuardia
--
affable
,
good-natured
and
ready
to
lead
New
York
out
of
the
mess
it
's
in
###
It
has
n't
helped
that
he
's
waffled
on
abortion
and
gay
rights
,
sought
the
support
of
both
the
Liberal
and
Conservative
parties
-LRB-
he
won
the
Liberal
endorsement
-RRB-
and
that
he
turned
to
comedian
Jackie
Mason
for
help
with
Jewish
voters
.
###
Mr.
Mason
left
the
campaign
after
telling
reporters
Mr.
Dinkins
is
``
a
fancy'shvartzer
'
with
a
moustache
.
''
###
Shvartzer
is
a
derogatory
Yiddish
word
for
a
black
person
.
###
Mr.
Dinkins
concedes
nothing
in
his
ability
to
stumble
and
bumble
.
###
He
can
match
Jackie
Mason
with
his
own
Robert
``
Sonny
''
Carson
,
an
angry
street
organizer
who
was
convicted
of
kidnapping
in
1974
.
###
The
Dinkins
campaign
paid
Mr.
Carson
close
to
$
10,000
to
get
out
the
vote
on
primary-election
day
.
###
Paper
work
on
how
it
was
spent
is
incomplete
.
###
Mr.
Carson
has
been
charged
with
being
anti-Semitic
.
###
Asked
about
that
the
other
day
,
he
replied
,
``
Anti-Semitic
?
###
I
'm
anti-white
.
''
###
More
troubling
for
Mr.
Dinkins
is
his
record
in
personal
accounting
.
###
It
began
in
1973
,
when
he
was
being
considered
for
deputy
mayor
,
and
a
routine
check
unearthed
the
extraordinary
fact
that
he
had
n't
paid
his
income
tax
for
the
previous
four
years
.
###
``
I
was
always
going
to
do
it
tomorrow
,
''
he
explained
at
the
time
.
###
And
now
he
's
busily
trying
to
explain
an
arrangement
in
which
he
sold
stock
in
Inner
City
Broadcasting
Co.
,
headed
by
his
old
friend
and
patron
,
Percy
Sutton
,
to
his
son
,
David
Dinkins
Jr.
,
for
$
58,000
.
###
He
had
valued
the
shares
at
more
than
$
1
million
two
years
earlier
.
###
He
says
he
sold
the
stock
to
avoid
conflict-of-interest
problems
in
his
role
as
a
voting
member
of
the
city
's
Board
of
Estimate
.
###
He
says
his
son
has
n't
paid
for
the
shares
.
###
``
It
looks
like
serious
tax
evasion
,
''
says
Mr.
Ailes
,
the
Giuliani
media
consultant
.
###
``
It
follows
the
same
pattern
as
his
tax
returns
.
###
He
waits
to
talk
about
it
until
after
he
gets
caught
.
''
###
``
He
simply
has
n't
explained
why
something
worth
a
million
dollars
ended
up
worth
$
58,000
two
years
later
,
''
says
Mr.
Powers
,
the
Giuliani
campaign
manager
.
###
It
's
ludicrous
for
him
to
suggest
it
's
the
difference
between
the'breakup
'
value
of
the
shares
and
their
market
value
.
''
###
So
far
though
,
no
one
--
not
even
former
U.S.
attorney
Giuliani
--
has
been
able
to
pinpoint
just
what
law
Mr.
Dinkins
has
broken
or
just
what
tax
he
has
evaded
.
###
``
The
crime
goes
to
character
,
''
says
Ron
Maiorana
,
a
consultant
to
the
Giuliani
campaign
.
###
It
's
serious
stuff
.
###
He
evades
and
ducks
.
###
He
's
had
a
history
of
deception
and
this
is
the
latest
chapter
.
''
###
``
It
makes
people
think
,
maybe
this
guy
is
n't
so
squeaky
clean
after
all
,
''
says
Mr.
Garth
,
Mayor
Koch
's
media
consultant
.
###
The
result
may
turn
out
to
be
a
lot
closer
than
people
think
.
###
The
long-running
scandal
surrounding
the
1982
collapse
of
Banco
Ambrosiano
was
reignited
by
the
arrest
last
week
of
Rome
businessman
Flavio
Carboni
on
fraud
charges
.
###
Rome
magistrates
accuse
Mr.
Carboni
and
several
other
people
of
trying
to
extort
1.2
billion
lire
-LRB-
$
880,000
-RRB-
from
the
Vatican
in
return
for
documents
contained
in
the
briefcase
of
Roberto
Calvi
,
the
Ambrosiano
chairman
found
hanged
under
London
's
Blackfriar
's
Bridge
shortly
before
the
bank
's
collapse
.
###
Banco
Ambrosiano
,
which
was
Italy
's
largest
private-sector
bank
,
collapsed
in
1982
with
$
1.3
billion
of
debts
.
###
Most
of
the
money
was
lent
to
a
series
of
shell
companies
in
Panama
and
Luxembourg
that
were
owned
,
directly
or
indirectly
,
by
the
Vatican
bank
.
###
The
Vatican
,
which
denies
any
wrongdoing
,
paid
$
250
million
to
the
Milan
bank
's
creditors
as
a
``
goodwill
gesture
''
in
1985
.
###
Italian
news
reports
said
Mr.
Carboni
and
a
colleague
obtained
1.2
billion
lire
in
checks
from
a
Vatican
official
,
Pavel
Hnilica
.
###
Italian
papers
speculated
the
briefcase
contained
papers
either
exonerating
the
Vatican
bank
from
blame
in
the
scandal
,
or
showing
that
the
bank
,
known
as
the
Istituto
per
le
Opere
di
Religione
,
channeled
funds
to
East
bloc
groups
such
as
Solidarity
in
Poland
.
###
Neither
Mr.
Hnilica
,
Mr.
Carboni
nor
Vatican
officials
could
be
reached
for
comment
over
the
weekend
.
###
This
business
trust
company
said
its

elected

.
###
The
investigation
,
which
will
be
coordinated
with
one
already
under
way
in
the
U.S.
,
follows
the
discovery
of
what
Ferranti
has
called
a
``
serious
''
fraud
involving
its
U.S.
subsidiary
.
###
International

in
1987
for

420
million

###
Ferranti
has
said
that
it
would
be
forced
to
write
off

Ferranti
said
that

###
Derek

its
troubles

###
Chicago
businessmen
Bertram
M.
Lee
and
Peter
Bynoe
signed
a
new
agreement
to
purchase
the
Denver
Nuggets
basketball
team
,
but
not
as
principal
owners
.
###
On
Saturday
,
the
partners
said
the
team
would
be
purchased
for
$
54
million
by
a
new
group
including
Comsat
Video
Enterprises
Inc.
,
a
unit
of
Communications
Satellite
Corp.
based
here
.
###
Comsat
Video
will
pay
$
17
million
for
a
62.5
%
interest
,
with
Messrs.
Lee
and
Bynoe
putting
up
$
8
million
for
a
37.5
%
stake
in
the
team
.
###
Under
terms
of
the
sale
,
Nuggets
owner
Sidney
Shlenker
could
receive
up
to
$
11
million
in
additional
payments
from
the
franchise
's
future
earnings
.
###
Messrs.
Lee
and
Bynoe
last
July
announced
a
deal
that
would
have
made
them
the
first
black
principal
owners
of
a
major
professional
sports
franchise
.
###
But
the
deal
fell
apart
last
week
for
lack
of
financing
.
###
Comsat
Video
is
headed
by
Robert
Wussler
,
who
resigned
his
No.
2
executive
post
with
Turner
Broadcasting
System
Inc.
just
two
weeks
ago
to
take
the
Comsat
position

to
their

,
as
Mr.
Turner
did
successfully
with
his

.
###
Messrs.

###
Royal
Business
Group
Inc.
said
it
filed
suit
in
federal
court
here
charging
Realist
Inc.
and
its
directors
with
violating
federal
securities
laws
``
by
engaging
in
a
scheme
to
prevent
''
Royal
from
acquiring
Realist
.
###
Royal
,
which
makes
and
distributes
business
forms
,
owns
an
8
%
stake
in
Realist
.
###
Royal
contends
that
Realist
failed
to
disclose
material
information
,
including
Realist
's
negotiations
to
acquire
Ammann
Laser
Technik
AG
,
to
stockholders
prior
to
Realist
's
June
6
annual
meeting
.
###
Royal
's
suit
contends
that
the
Ammann
acquisition
was
``
designed
to
entrench
management
and
thwart
Royal
's
offer
.
''
###
Royal
withdrew
its
offer
to
buy
Realist
,
a
maker
of
optical
and
electronic
products
based
in
Menomonee
Falls
,
Wis.
,
for
$
14.06
a
share
in
July
after
Realist
disclosed
the
Ammann
purchase
.
###
The
suit
seeks
``
in
excess
of
$
350,000
in
damages
.
''
###
A
Realist
official
said
the
company
had
n't
yet
received
the
full
complaint
and
would
n't
have
a
response
until
it
had
an
opportunity
to
review
it
.
###
Winnebago
Industries
Inc.
,
battered
by
a
deepening
slowdown
in
recreational
vehicle
industry
sales
,
reported
a
widened
fourth-quarter
loss
and
slashed
its
dividend
in
half
.
###
The
Forest
City
,
Iowa
,
maker
of
motor
homes
said
it
had
a
loss
of
$
11.3
million
,
or
46
cents
a
share
,
in
the
quarter
ended
Aug.
26
.
###
A
year
earlier
,
the
company
had
a
deficit
of
$
1.5
million
,
or
six
cents
a
share
.
###
The
cut
in
the
dividend
to
10
cents
a
share
semiannually
,
from
20
cents
,
``
would
indicate
to
me
they
do
n't
see
the
problems
being
fixed
real
quick
,
''
said
Frank
Rolfes
,
an
analyst
at
Dain
Bosworth
Inc.
in
Minneapolis
.
###
Indeed
,
Winnebago
said
it
started
``
several
promotional
programs
''
to
spur
retail
sales
in
the
fall
and
winter
.
###
The
year
was
already
shaping
up
as
a
difficult
one
for
the
recreational
vehicle
industry
,
which
makes
products
such
as
motor
homes
,
travel
trailers
,
folding
campers
and
van
conversions
.
###
With
the
exception
of
van
conversions
,
the
industry
has
seen
a
decline
from
1988
's
robust
sales
.
###
But
the
rate
of
the
decline
snowballed
in
August
,
with
unit
sales
to
dealers
for
the
month
down
10.5
%
from
a
year
earlier
,
according
to
the
Recreation
Vehicle
Industry
Association
.
###
At
Winnebago
,
sales
for
the
quarter
fell
6
%
to
$
89.5
million
from
$
95.4
million
a
year
earlier
.
###
The
company
attributed
the
decline
to
consumers
'
concern
over
interest
rates
and
gas
prices
--
two
key
expenses
for
RV
buyers
.
###
``
It
's
a
large-ticket
discretionary
purchase
,
''
said
Robert
Curran
,
who
follows
the
industry
for
Merrill
Lynch
&
Co
.
###
So
when
there
's
talk
and
concern
about
the
economy
,
it
's
not
unreasonable
for
a
portion
of
the
buying
public
to
defer
purchases
.
''
###
Mr.
Curran
expects
industry
RV
sales
for
all
of
1989
to
fall
about
5
%
from
1988
,
when
sales
of
427,300
units
were
the
highest
since
1978
.
###
And
he
said
the
weakness
could
continue
in
the
first
half
of
next
year
.
###
But
he
said
the
industry
has
``
a
good
decade
ahead
,
''
particularly
if
aging
baby
boomers
fulfill
the
industry
's
dreams
by
buying
RVs
.
###
Winnebago
was
hit
especially
hard
in
the
latest
downturn
because
unit
sales
in
its
bread-and-butter
motor
home
business
tumbled
25
%
industrywide
in
August
,
and
10.4
%
in
the
first
eight
months
of
the
year
.
###
The
company
said
it
also
suffered
in
the
quarter
from
incentive
programs
,
losses
from
discontinuing
a
motor
home
line
and
costs
of
developing
a
new
commercial
vehicle
,
among
other
things
.
###
The
news
sent
Winnebago
stock
falling
62.5
cents
,
to
$
5.25
,
in
New
York
Stock
Exchange
composite
trading-a
52-week
low
.
###
The
dividend
cut
will
prove
most
costly
for
John
K.
Hanson
,
Winnebago
's
founder
and
chairman
.
###
Based
on
his
control
of
about
45
%
of
Winnebago
's
24.7
million
shares
,
his
annual
dividend
income
would
be
cut
to
about
$
2.2
million
from
$
4.4
million
.
###
For
the
year
,
Winnebago
had
a
loss
of
$
4.7
million
,
or
19
cents
a
share
,
following
profit
of
$
2.7
million
,
or
11
cents
a
share
,
a
year
earlier
.
###
Sales
rose
2
%
to
$
437.5
million
from
$
430.3
million
.
###
Bullish
bond
market
sentiment
is
on
the
rise
again
.
###
As
the
government
prepares
to
release
the
next
batch
of
economic
reports
,
the
consensus
among
economists
and
money
managers
is
that
the
news
will
be
negative
.
###
And
that
,
they
say
,
will
be
good
for
bonds
.
###
``
Recent
data
have
indicated
somewhat
weaker
economic
activity
,
''
said
Elliott
Platt
,
director
of
economic
research
at
Donaldson
,
Lufkin
&
Jenrette
Securities
.
###
Mr.
Platt
is
advising
clients
that
``
the
near-term
direction
of
bond
prices
is
likely
to
remain
upward
.
''
###
Analysts
insist
that
even
without
help
from
a
shaky
stock
market
,
which
provided
a
temporary
boost
for
bonds
during
the
Oct.
13
stock
market
plunge
,
bond
prices
will
start
to
climb
on
the
prospects
that
the
Federal
Reserve
will
allow
interest
rates
to
move
lower
in
the
coming
weeks
.
###
That
would
be
comforting
to
fixed-income
investors
,
many
of
whom
were
badly
burned
in
the
third
quarter
by
incorrectly
assuming
that
the
Fed
would
ease
.
###
Investors
rushed
to
buy
bonds
during
the
summer
as
prices
soared
on
speculation
that
interest
rates
would
continue
to
fall
.
###
But
when
it
became
clear
that
rates
had
stabilized
and
that
the
Fed
's
credit-easing
policy
was
on
hold
,
bond
yields
jumped
and
prices
tumbled
.
###
Long-term
bonds
have
performed
erratically
this
year
.
###
For
example
,
a
group
of
long-term
Treasury
bonds
tracked
by
Merrill
Lynch
&
Co.
produced
a
total
return
of
1
%
in
the
first
quarter
,
12.45
%
in
the
second
quarter
and
%
in
the
third
quarter
.
###
Total
return
is
price
changes
plus
interest
income
.
###
Now
some
investment
analysts
insist
that
the
economic
climate
has
turned
cold
and
gloomy
,
and
they
are
urging
clients
to
buy
bonds
before
the
rally
begins
.
###
Among
other
things
,
economists
note
that
consumer
spending
is
slowing
,
corporate
profit
margins
are
being
squeezed
,
business
confidence
is
slipping
and
construction
and
manufacturing
industries
are
depressed
.
###
At
the
same
time
,
last
week
's
consumer
price
index
showed
that
inflation
is
moderating
.
###
Add
it
all
up
and
it
means
``
that
the
Fed
has
a
little
leeway
to
ease
its
credit
policy
stance
without
the
risk
of
rekindling
inflation
,
''
said
Norman
Robertson
,
chief
economist
at
Mellon
Bank
Corp.
,
Pittsburgh
.
###
I
think
we
will
see
a
federal
funds
rate
of
close
to
8
%
in
the
next
two
weeks
and
8
%
by
year
end
.
''
###
The
federal
funds
rate
,
which
banks
charge
each
other
on
overnight
loans
,
is
considered
an
early
signal
of
changes
in
the
Fed
's
credit
policy
.
###
Economists
generally
agree
that
the
rate
was
lowered
by
the
Fed
from
around
9
%
,
where
it
had
been
since
July
,
to
about
8
%
in
early
October
on
the
heels
of
a
weak
employment
report
.
###
Although
the
rate
briefly
drifted
even
lower
following
the
stock
market
sell-off
that
occurred
Oct.
13
,
it
ended
Friday
at
about
8
%
.
###
James
Kochan
,
chief
fixed-income
strategist
at
Merrill
Lynch
,
is
touting
shorter-term
securities
,
which
he
says
should
benefit
more
quickly
than
longer-term
bonds
as
interest
rates
fall
.
###
``
Given
our
forecast
for
lower
rates
,
purchases
made
now
should
prove
quite
rewarding
before
year
end
,
''
he
said
.
###
Mr.
Kochan
also
likes
long-term
,
investment-grade
corporate
bonds
and
long-term
Treasurys
.
###
He
says
these
bonds
should
appreciate
in
value
as
some
investors
,
reacting
to
the
recent
turmoil
in
the
stock
and
high-yield
junk
bond
markets
,
seek
safer
securities
.
###
``
If
the
-LCB-
Tennessee
Valley
Authority
-RCB-
sale
is
any
guide
,
there
appears
to
be
good
demand
for
top-quality
,
long-term
paper
from
both
domestic
and
overseas
accounts
,
''
he
said
.
###
TVA
,
in
its
first
public
debt
offering
in
15
years
,
sold
$
4
billion
of
long-term
and
intermediate-term
securities
last
week
.
###
Strong
investor
demand
prompted
the
utility
to
boost
the
size
of
the
issue
from
$
3
billion
.
###
TVA
,
which
operates
one
of
the
nation
's
largest
electric
power
systems
,
is
a
corporation
owned
by
the
federal
government
.
###
But
persuading
investors
to
buy
bonds
may
be
especially
tough
this
week
,
when
the
U.S.
government
will
auction
more
than
$
30
billion
of
new
securities
.
###
Today
,
the
Treasury
Department
will
sell
$
15.6
billion
of
three-month
and
six-month
bills
at
the
regular
weekly
auction
.
###
Tomorrow
,
the
Treasury
will
sell
$
10
billion
of
two-year
notes
.
###
Resolution
Funding
Corp.
,
known
as
Refcorp
,
a
division
of
a
new
government
agency
created
to
bail
out
the
nation
's
troubled
savings
and
loan
associations
,
will
hold
its
first
bond
auction
Wednesday
,
when
it
will
sell
$
4.5
billion
of
30-year
bonds
.
###
All
of
this
comes
ahead
of
the
government
's
big
quarterly
refunding
of
the
federal
debt
,
which
takes
place
sometime
in
November
.
###
So
far
,
investors
have
n't
shown
much
appetite
for
Refcorp
's
initial
bond
offering
.
###
Roger
Early
,
a
portfolio
manager
at
Federated
Investors
Corp.
,
said
that
yields
on
the
so-called
bailout
bonds
are
n't
high
enough
to
attract
his
attention
.
###
``
Why
should
I
bother
with
something
that
's
an
unknown
for
a
very
small
pickup
in
yield
?
''
he
said
.
###
``
I
'm
not
going
to
jump
on
them
the
first
day
they
come
out
.
''
###
He
seems
to
be
typical
of
many
professional
money
managers
.
###
When
the
size
of
the
Refcorp
offering
was
announced
last
week
and
when-issued
trading
activity
began
,
the
bailout
bonds
were
yielding
about
percentage
point
more
than
the
Treasury
's
benchmark
30-year
bond
.
###
On
Friday
,
the
yield
was
quoted
at
about
percentage
point
higher
than
the
benchmark
bond
,
an
indication
of
weak
demand
.
###
Some
economists
believe
that
yields
on
all
Treasury
securities
may
rise
this
week
as
the
market
struggles
to
absorb
the
new
supply
.
###
But
once
the
new
securities
are
digested
,
they
expect
investors
to
focus
on
the
weak
economic
data
.
###
``
The
supply
is
not
a
constraint
to
the
market
,
''
said
Samuel
Kahan
,
chief
financial
economist
at
Kleinwort
Benson
Government
Securities
Inc
.
###
If
one
thinks
that
rates
are
going
down
,
you
do
n't
care
how
much
supply
is
coming
.
''
###
Friday
's
Market
Activity
###
Most
bond
prices
fell
on
concerns
about
this
week
's
new
supply
and
disappointment
that
stock
prices
did
n't
stage
a
sharp
decline
.
###
Junk
bond
prices
moved
higher
,
however
.
###
In
early
trading
,
Treasury
bonds
were
higher
on
expectations
that
a
surge
in
buying
among
Japanese
investors
would
continue
.
###
Also
providing
support
to
Treasurys
was
hope
that
the
stock
market
might
see
declines
because
of
the
expiration
of
some
stock-index
futures
and
options
on
indexes
and
individual
stocks
.
###
Those
hopes
were
dashed
when
the
stock
market
put
in
a
relatively
quiet
performance
.
###
Treasury
bonds
ended
with
losses
of
as
much
as
point
,
or
about
$
2.50
for
each
$
1,000
face
amount
.
###
The
benchmark
30-year
bond
,
which
traded
as
high
as
102
during
the
day
,
ended
at
101
.
###
The
yield
on
the
benchmark
bond
rose
slightly
to
7.98
%
from
7.96
%
.
###
In
the
corporate
bond
market
,
traders
said
the
new-issue
market
for
junk
bonds
is
likely
to
pick
up
following
Chicago
&
North
Western
Acquisition
Corp.
's
$
475
million
junk
bond
offering
Friday
.
###
Today
,
for
example
,
underwriters
at
Morgan
Stanley
&
Co.
said
they
expect
to
price
a
$
150
million
,
12-year
senior
subordinated
debenture
offering
by
Imo
Industries
Inc
.
###
Traders
expect
the
issue
to
be
priced
to
yield
12
%
.
###
Shearson
Lehman
Hutton
Inc.
said
that
a
$
150
million
senior
subordinated
discount
debenture
issue
by
R.P.
Scherer
Drugs
is
expected
by
the
end
of
the
month
.
###
However
,
despite
the
big
new-issue
calendar
,
many
junk
bond
investors
and
analysts
are
skeptical
the
deals
will
get
done
.
###
``
There
are
about
a
dozen
more
deals
coming
,
''
said
Michael
McNamara
,
director
of
fixed-income
research
at
Kemper
Financial
Services
Inc
.
###
If
they
had
this
much
trouble
with
Chicago
&
North
Western
,
they
are
going
to
have
an
awful
time
with
the
rest
.
''
###
Last
week
,
underwriters
were
forced
to
postpone
three
junk
bond
deals
because
of
recent
weakness
in
the
market
.
###
And
pressure
by
big
investors
forced
Donaldson
Lufkin
&
Jenrette
Securities
Corp.
to
sweeten
Chicago
&
North
Western
's
$
475

bond

###
After
hours
of
negotiating
that
stretched
late
into
Thursday
night
,
underwriters
priced
the
12-year
issue
of
resettable
senior
subordinated
debentures
at
par
to
yield
14.75
%
,
higher
than
the
14.5
%
that
had
been
expected
.
###
The
coupon
on
the
issue
will
be
reset
in
one
year
at
a
rate
that
will
give
the
issue
a
market
value
of
101
.
###
However
,
the
maximum
coupon
rate
on
the
issue
when
it
is
reset
is
15.50
%
.
###
Debenture
holders
also
will
receive
the
equivalent
of
10
%
of
the
common
stock
in
Chicago
&
North
Western
's
parent
company
.
###
``
The
coupon
was
raised
to
induce
some
of
the
big
players
on
the
fence
to
come
in
,
''
said
a
spokesman
for
Donaldson
.
###
We
put
a
price
on
the
deal
that
the
market
required
to
get
it
done
.
''
###
The
spokesman
said
the
issue
was
sold
out
and
met
with
strong
interest
abroad
,
particularly
from
Japanese
investors
.

In
the

Sotheby
's
Inc.
's
gamble
in
the
art-dealing
business
appears
to
have
paid
off
.
###
The
New
York
arm
of
the
London-based
auction
house
auctioned
off
the
estate
of
John
T.
Dorrance
Jr.
,
the
Campbell
's
Soup
Co.
heir
,
for
$
131
million
last
week
,
a
record
for
a
single-owner
art
collection
.
###
That
total
was
below
the
$
140
million
the
auction
house
estimated
the
collection
might
sell
for
,
but
was
enough
to
ensure
that
an
unprecedented
financial
arrangement
Sotheby
's
had
made
with
the
Dorrance
family
proved
profitable
to
the
auction
house
.
###
Sotheby
's
provided
the
Dorrance
family
a
guarantee
of
at
least
$
100
million
,
and
as
much
as
$
120
million
,
to
obtain
the
collection
,
people
familiar
with
the
transaction
said
,
thus
taking
a
greater
than
usual
financial
interest
in
the
property
to
be
sold
.
###
The
Dorrance
estate
,
auctioned
off
in
a
series
of
sales
held
over
four
days
,
included
porcelains
,
furniture
and
paintings
.
###
An
Henri
Matisse
,
auctioned
last
Wednesday
,
fetched

In
addition
,
a
handful

###
The
Better
Business
Bureau
of
San
Diego
and
the
state
Attorney
General
's
office
entered
into
a
settlement
stemming
from
an
investigation
of
bureau-sponsored
business
directories
published
by
an
outside
firm
,
Better
Book
Inc
.
###
The
settlement
stems
from
charges
that
Better
Book
,
now
defunct
,
made
misrepresentations
in
selling
advertising
for
the
directories
and
memberships
in
the
bureau
from
1984
to
1986
.
###
Without
admitting
any
guilt
,
the
bureau
agreed
to
several
conditions
if
it
again
contracts
with
an
outside
firm
to
publish
its
directories
.
###
The
conditions
include
not
misrepresenting
how
many
directories
will
be
distributed
,
and
agreeing
to
make
refunds
to
directory
advertisers
if
any
misrepresentations
are
involved
in
the
sale
.
###
The
Attorney
General
's
investigation
was
sparked
by
lawsuits
and
charges
by
angry
California
businesspeople
that
they
were
swindled
in
a
bureau-sponsored
directory
project
contracted
by
Better
Book
.
###
The
uproar
led
to
the
closing
of
the
Los
Angeles
Better
Business
Bureau
in
late
1987
.
###
McCaw
Cellular
Communications
Inc.
said
it
obtained
``
firm
''
financing
commitments
from
three
major
banks
in
regard
to
its
offer
for
50.3
%
of
LIN
Broadcasting
Corp
.
###
Morgan
Guaranty
Trust
,
Toronto-Dominion
Bank
and
Provident
National
Bank
,
an
affiliate
of
PNC
Financial
Corp.
,
jointly
committed
$
1.2
billion
of
financing
,
subject
to
certain
conditions
,
McCaw
said
.
###
Further
,
McCaw
said
the
banks
expressed
confidence
that
the
balance
of
the
$
4.5
billion
bank
facility
will
be
committed
within
the
next
several
weeks
by
a
syndicate
of
foreign
and
domestic
banks
.
###
Morgan
,
Toronto-Dominion
and
Provident
are
leading
that
syndicate
.
###
McCaw
is
offering
to
buy
22
million
shares
of
LIN
for
$
125
each
in
cash
,
which
would
result
in
McCaw
owning
50.3
%
of
the
cellular-phone
and
broadcasting
concern
.
###
The
offer
is
in
limbo
,
however
,
because
LIN
has
agreed
to
merge
its
cellular-phone
businesses
with
BellSouth
Corp
.
###
In
national
over-the-counter
trading
Friday
,
LIN

rose

Beijing
lawmakers
have
called
for
jails
to
be
built
to
house
prostitutes
and
for
severe
punishment
,
including
the
death
sentence
,
for
anyone
who
induces
or
coerces
women
into
prostitution
.
###
The
official
Xinhua
News
Agency
said
the
municipal
government
was
discussing
a
draft
bill
to
give
the
capital
its
first
anti-prostitution
statutes
.
###
It
quoted
Liu
Changyi
,
deputy
director
of
the
Beijing
Public
Security
Bureau
,
as
saying
that
there
were
many
more
people
involved
in
prostitution
now
than
in
1985
,
when
there
were
about
100
cases
.
###
Foreigners
involved
in
prostitution
will
be
punished
according
to
the
law
,
and
those
with
sexually
transmitted
diseases
will
be
expelled
from
the
country
,
according
to
the
regulations
.
###
The
Communists
nearly
succeeded
in
eliminating
prostitution
after
taking
over
in
1949
,
but
the
practice
has
returned
in
recent
years
with
the
country
's
increased
exposure
to
the
outside
world
.
###
Japan
agreed
to
enforce
a
decision
by
an
international
wildlife
conference
to
ban
all
trade
in
ivory
,
a
spokesman
for
the
Ministry
of
International
Trade
and
Industry
said
.
###
Earlier
,
Japan
had
said
it
might
file
a
reservation
against
the
ivory
ban
decided
by
ballot
at
the
103-nation
United
Nations
Conference
on
International
Trade
in

Species
in
Switzerland
last
week
.
###
The
Japanese

Italy
should
close
the
Leaning

East
Germany
pledged
to
reduce
alcohol
consumption
by
boosting
production
of
soft
drinks
and
fruit
juices
.
###
Trade
and
Supply
Minister
Gerhard
Briksa
said
in
a
letter
published
in
the
youth
daily
Junge
Welt
that
the
rise
in
alcohol
consumption
in
East
Germany
had
been
halted
;
but
to
reduce
it
further
,
he
said
,
production
and
supply
of
other
beverages
,
including
fruit
juices
,
should
be
stepped
up
.
###
He
added
that
shops
will
have
to
continue
reducing
their
stocks
of
liquor
and
avoid
displaying
them
too
prominently
in
the
window
.
###
Hong
Kong
has
built
a
detention
center
for
illegal
immigrants
from
China
because
China
has
refused
for
the
past
two
weeks
to
accept
them
back
.
###
The
center
,
close
to
Hong
Kong
's
border
with
China
,
will
be
ready
today
and
will
be
able
to
house
1,000
inmates
,
Police
Deputy
Director
Peter
Wong
said
.
###
The
dispute
started
when
China
,
angry
that
Hong
Kong
had
allowed
dissident
swimmer
Yang
Yang
to
flee
to
the
U.S.
,
halted
the
usual
daily
transfer
of
illegal
immigrants
caught
in
this
British
colony
,
which
reverts
to
Beijing
's
control
in
1997

###
Sweating
under
the
glare
of
newly
installed
television
lights
,
British
members
of
Parliament
demanded
a
halt
to
the
experimental
televising
of
debates
.
###
A
group
of
senior
Conservative
legislators
,
complaining
the
House
of
Commons
was
like
a
sauna
,
demanded
that
the
experiment
be
stopped
unless
the
intensity
of
the
lights
is
reduced
.
###
One
Conservative
MP
,
David
Wilshire
,
said
:
``
I
should
have
a
wonderful
suntan
by
Christmas
.
''
###
Debates
are
due
to
be
broadcast
nationally
starting
Nov.
21
in
a
six-month
experiment
.
###
A
majority
of
Japanese
banks
are
said
to
be
wary
of
making
new
loans
to
Mexico
under
the
Brady
plan
because
they
're
uncertain
the
Mexican
economy
will
remain
stable
.
###
Instead
,
many
small
and
medium-sized
banks
,
and
some
larger
ones
,
are
likely
to
take
one
of
the
other
two
options
open
to
them
under
the
plan
,
Japanese
banking
officials
said
.
###
The
plan
,
proposed
by
U.S.
Secretary
of
State
Nicholas
Brady
,
calls
for
banks
either
to
make
new
loans
or
to
reduce
the
principle
on
existing
loans
or
to
cut
the
interest
rate
on
those
existing
loans
.
###
The
officials
said
that
most
Japanese
banks
prefer
the
losses
they
'd
suffer
in
either
of
the
latter
options
to
the
risk
of
new
lending
.
###
But
an
official
at
a
long-term
credit
bank
explained
that
since
some
larger
banks
have
already
taken
loss
provisions
for
loans
to
other
Third
World
nations
,
further
write-offs
could
be
viewed
as
intolerable
.
###
``
They
ca
n't
take
the
hit
''
to
their
earnings
,
he
said
.
###
As
a
result
,
the
official
said
,
they
may
be
forced
into
a
no-win
situation
in
which
they
make
risky
loans
that
they
could
have
to
write
off
later
.
###
A
poll
in
male-dominated
South
Korea
put
Margaret
Thatcher
first
on
a
list
of
most-respected
foreign
leaders
.
###
The
British
prime
minister
was
the
only
woman
singled
out
by
respondents
,
who
put
Soviet
President
Mikhail
Gorbachev
in
second
place
.
###
The
Soviet
newspaper
Trud
reported
that
Mickey
Mouse
will
appear
in
a
Russian-language
comic
book
to
be
issued
four
times
a
year
by
Soviet
publisher
Fizkultura
i
Sport
and
Denmark
's
Gutenberghus
Group
.
###
The
comic
book
will
cost
about
$
2
.
###
Ekco
Group
Inc.
,
Nashua
,
N.H.
,
expects
to
report
that
net
income
in
the
third
quarter
,
ended
Oct.
1
,
fell
50
%
to
60
%
from
$
2.1
million
,
or
11
cents
a
share
,
a
year
earlier
.
###
Robert
Stein
,
president
and
chief
executive
officer
,
attributed
the
expected
decline
partly
to
the
effects
of
a
two-week
strike
last
month
at
the
company
's
Masillon
,
Ohio
,
bakeware
facility
.
###
Softer-than-expected
orders
in
early
September
also
played
a
role
,
he
said
in
an
interview
.
###
But
Mr.
Stein
said
he
is
``
reasonably
confident
''
that
earnings
for
the
full
year
will
exceed
the
$
3.1
million
,
or
17
cents
a
share
,
in
1988
.
###
That
would
require
fourth-quarter
net
of
more
than
about
22
cents
to
24
cents
a
share
,
assuming
that
Mr.
Stein
's
third-quarter
estimate
proves
accurate
.
###
In
the
year-earlier
fourth
quarter
,
the
company
had
profit
of
$
2.7
million
,
or
15
cents
a
share
.
###
Third-quarter
revenue
is
expected
to
be
$
40
million
to
$
45
million
,
up
from
$
38.2
million
a
year
earlier
,
according
to
Neil
Gordon
,
treasurer
.
###
The
year-earlier
periods
do
n't
reflect
results
of
the
company
's
Woodstream
Corp.
unit
,
acquired
last
January
,
but
include
some
Canadian
operations
that
were
sold
at
the
end
of
1988
.
###
August
through
October
traditionally
is
the
busiest
season
for
the
bakeware
business
,
as
many
retailers
use
the
goods
as
autumn
promotional
items
.
###
Mr.
Stein
said
some
retailers
--
perhaps
anxious
about
minimizing
inventories
--
appear
to
have
held
back
on
orders
in
September
but
have
been
ordering
more
heavily
in
October
.
###
Mr.
Stein
said
Woodstream
is
``
marginally
profitable
''
but
has
n't
performed
as
well
as
expected
.
###
Woodstream
's
Victor-brand
mousetraps
and
other
pest-control
products
are
``
doing
very
well
,
''
and
its
plastic
storage-case
products
``
are
poised
for
growth
,
''
he
said
.
###
But
the
unit
's
third
segment
,
wildlife
traps
,
is
suffering
from
a
``
depressed
market
,
''
and
Ekco
is
seeking
to
sell
that
segment
,
he
said
.
###
Mr.
Stein
said
he
expects
profit
to
be
higher
in
1990
than
in
1989
,
reflecting
a
number
of
measures
taken
since
the
acquisition
of
Ekco
Housewares
in
late
1987
.
###
Prior
to
acquiring
the
housewares
business
,
the
company
was
known
as
Centronics
Corp.
;
Centronics
had
been
a
maker
of
computer
printers
,
but
Mr.
Stein
and
other
officers
decided
to
sell
that
business
after
Japanese
competitors
grabbed
a
dominant
share
of
the
market
.
-RRB-
###
Mr.
Stein
said
tighter
operating
controls
have
enabled
Ekco
to
reduce
inventory
levels
25
%
to
30
%
;
improve
on-time
delivery
of
orders
to
about
95
%
from
around
70
%
;
and
to
lower
the
number
of
labor
hours
required
to
produce
a
unit
.
###
By
moving
the
design
of
new
products
in-house
--
instead
of
contracting
out
the
work
--
the
company
also
has
been
able
to
come
up
with
designs
that
can
be
manufactured
more
efficiently
,
he
said
.
###
In
addition
to
those
measures
,
the
company
spent
heavily
earlier
this
year
to
install
displays
at
its
customers
'
retail
outlets
--
a
strategy
that
Mr.
Stein
said
has
helped
bolster
awareness
of
the
company
's
brands
.
###
Ekco
's
housewares
operation
makes
kitchen
tools
and
gadgets
,
as
well
as
bakeware
,
at
factories
in
the
U.S.
and
Canada
.
###
The
main
issue
in
the
strike
at
the
Ohio
facility
was
health-care
benefits
,
Mr.
Stein
said
.
###
The
strike
ended
Oct
.
###
Ekco
continues
to
seek
further
acquisitions
in
the
consumer-products
industry
,
Mr.
Stein
said
.
###
He
indicated
that
Ekco
may
be
interested
in
acquiring
another
company
with
revenue
in
the
range
of
$
75
million
to
$
100
million
,
partly
because
mass
merchandisers
increasingly
want
to
rely
on
larger
,
and
fewer
,
suppliers
.
###
After
several
years
of
booming
business
with
China
,
foreign
traders
are
bracing
for
the
biggest
slump
in
a
decade
.
###
The
imposition
of
austerity
measures
,
starting
last
October
,
already
had
begun
to
pinch
when
the
massacre
in
Tiananmen
Square
on
June
4
and
subsequent
events
tugged
the
belt
far
tighter
.
###
Foreign
lending
has
been
virtually
suspended
since
then
,
choking
liquidity
and
hobbling
many
projects
.
###
And
Beijing
has
pulled
back
on
domestic
loans
and
subsidies
,
leaving
many
domestic
buyers
and
export-oriented
plants
strapped
for
cash
.
###
Givaudan
Far
East
Ltd.
,
a
Swiss
concern
that
sells
chemicals
to
shampoo
and
soap
factories
in
China
,
typifies
the
problems
.
###
Last
year
's
retrenchment
dried
up
the
working
capital
of
Chinese
factories
.
###
The
company
's
sales
flattened
during
1989
's
first
half
.
###
The
June
killings
magnified
the
problems
.
###
In
Canton
,
Givaudan
's
representative
office
received
no
orders
in
June
.
###
At
first
it
attributed
the
slump
to
temporary
business
disruptions
,
but
when
no
orders
were
logged
in
August
and
September
,
manager
Donald
Lai
became
convinced
that
business
would
be
bad
for
many
months
.
###
``
Things
have
grown
worse
since
June
4
,
''
Mr.
Lai
says
.
###
He
predicts
that
sales
will
drop
between
30
%
and
40
%
from
last
year
's
$
3
million
.
###
The
consumer-products
and
light-industrial
sectors
are
bearing
the
brunt
of
China
's
austerity
measures
,
and
foreign
companies
such
as
Givaudan
that
deal
with
those
industries
are
being
hit
the
hardest
.
###
But
in
general
,
all
foreign-trading
companies
are
feeling
the
pinch
.
###
``
The
import
pie
will
shrink
,
''
says
John
Kamm
,
first
vice
president
of
the
American
Chamber
of
Commerce
in
Hong
Kong
and
a
China
trade
specialist
.
###
On
the
down
side
,
sales
could
fall
as
much
as
90
%
for
some
companies
;
on
the
upper
side
,
sales
will
be
flat
.
''
###
China
's
foreign
trade
has
gone
in
cycles
during
the
past
decade
.
###
The
last
time
that
traders
experienced
a
trough
was
during
1985-86
,
when
Beijing
imposed
tough
measures
to
curb
imports
and
conserve
foreign
exchange
.
###
The
current
trough
is
expected
to
be
much
deeper
,
because
Beijing
has
cut
off
domestic
funds
from
factories
for
the
first
time
to
slow
inflation
.
###
In
addition
,
the
suspension
of
loans
and
export
credits
from
foreign
governments
and
institutions
following
the
June
killings
have
been
a
big
setback
.
###
``
The
freeze
on
new
lending
is
dealing
the
single
biggest
blow
to
trading
,
''
says
Raymond
Wong
,
China
manager
for
Mannesmann
AG
,
a
West
German
machinery-trading
company
.
###
Import
growth
from
the
year-earlier
months
slowed
to
16
%
in
July
and
7.1
%
in
August
,
compared
with
an
average
growth
rate
of
26
%
in
the
first
half
.
###
In
the
first
eight
months
of
1989
,
imports
grew
21
%
,
to
$
38.32
billion
,
down
slightly
from
a
growth
rate
of
23
%
a
year
earlier
.
###
The
picture
for
China
's
exports
is
just
as
bleak
,
mainly
because
of
the
domestic
credit
squeeze
.
###
Exports
in
the
first
eight
months
grew
only
9
%
,
to
$
31.48
billion
,
compared
with
a
growth
rate
of
25
%
a
year
earlier
,
according
to
Chinese
customs
figures
.
###
The
threat
to
China
's
balance
of
payments
is
further
aggravated
by
the
plunge
in
its
foreign-exchange
reserves
,
excluding
gold
holdings
.
###
The
reserves
dropped
for
the
first
time
in
recent
years
,
to
$
14
billion
in
June
from
$
19
billion
in
April
.
###
The
trend
has
prompted
Beijing
to
intensify
efforts
to
curb
imports
.
###
In
recent
weeks
,
China
's
leaders
have
recentralized
trading
in
wool
and
scores
of
chemical
products
and
commodities
.
###
The
Ministry
of
Foreign
Economic
Relations
and
Trade
set
up
a
special
bureau
last
month
to
monitor
the
issue
of
import
and
export
licenses
.
###
Beijing
's
periodic
clampdowns
on
imports
have
taught
many
trading
companies
that
the
best
way
to
get
through
the
drought
is
by
helping
China
export
.
###
For
example
,
Nissho
Iwai
Corp.
,
one
of
the
biggest
Japanese
trading
houses
,
now
buys
almost
twice
as
many
goods
from
China
as
it
sells
to
that
country
.
###
Three
years
ago
,
the
ratio
was
reversed
.
###
But
the
strategy
is
n't
helping
much
this
time
.
###
``
Both
sectors
of
imports
and
exports
look
just
as
bad
,
''
says
Masahiko
Kitamura
,
general
manager
of
Nissho
Iwai
's
Canton
office
.
###
He
expects
the
company
's
trading
business
to
drop
as
much
as
40
%
this
year
.
###
For
a
short
time
after
June
4
,
it
appeared
that
the
trade
picture
would
remain
fairly
bright
.
###
Many
foreign
trading
offices
in
Hong
Kong
were
swamped
with
telexes
and
telephone
calls
from
Chinese
trade
officials
urging
them
not
to
sever
ties
.
###
Even
the
Bank
of
China
,
which
normally
took
weeks
to
process
letters
of
credit
,
was
settling
the
letters
at
record
speed
to
dispel
rumors
about
the
bank
's
financial
health
.
###
But
when
foreign
traders
tried
to
do
business
,
they
discovered
that
the
eagerness
of
Chinese
trade
officials
was
just
a
smokescreen
.
###
The
suspension
of
foreign
loans
has
weakened
the
buying
power
of
China
's
national
trading
companies
,
which
are
among
the
country
's
biggest
importers
.
###
Business
is
n't
any
better
on
the
provincial
or
municipal
level
,
foreign
traders
say
.
###
Shanghai
Investment
&
Trust
Co.
,
known
as
Sitco
,
is
the
city
's
main
financier
for
trading
business
.
###
Sitco
had
customarily
tapped
the
Japanese
bond
market
for
funds
,
but
it
ca
n't
do
that
any
longer
.
###
Foreign
traders
say
the
company
is
strapped
for
cash
.
###
``
It
has
difficulties
paying
its
foreign
debts
,
''
says
a
Hong
Kong
executive
who
is
familiar
with
Sitco
's
business
.
###
How
can
it
make
available
funds
for
purchases
?
''
###
Foreign
traders
also
say
many
of
China
's
big
infrastructural
projects
have
been
canceled
or
postponed
because
of
the
squeeze
on
domestic
and
foreign
credit
.
###
Albert
Lee
,
a
veteran
trader
who
specializes
in
machinery
sales
,
estimates
that
as
many
as
70
%
of
projects
that
had
obtained
approval
to
proceed
have
been
canceled
in
recent
months
.
###
``
There
are
virtually
no
new
projects
,
and
that
means
no
new
business
for
us
,
''
he
says
.
###
Even
when
new
lending
resumes
,
foreign
exchange
would
still
be
tight
because
Beijing
will
likely
try
to
rein
in
foreign
borrowing
,
which
has
grown
between
30
%
and
40
%
in
the
past
few
years
.
###
And
foreign
creditors
are
likely
to
be
more
cautious
about
extending
new
loans
because
China
is
nearing
a
peak
repayment
period
as
many
loans
start
falling
due
in
the
next
two
to
five
years
.
###
Another
reason
for
the
intensity
of
the
trade
problems
is
that
Beijing
has
extended
the
current
clampdown
on
imports
beyond
the
usual
target
of
consumer
products
to
include
steel
,
chemical
fertilizers
and
plastics
.
###
These
have
been
among
the
country
's
leading
imports
,
particularly
last
year
when
there
were
shortages
that
led
many
traders
to
buy
heavily
and
pay
dearly
.
###
But
the
shortages
also
spawned
rampant
speculation
and
spiraling
prices
.
###
To
stem
speculation
,
Beijing
imposed
ceiling
prices
that
went
into
effect
earlier
this
year
.
###
Traders
who
had
bought
the
goods
at
prices
above
the
ceiling
do
n't
want
to
take
a
loss
on
resales
and
are
holding
onto
their
stock
.
###
The
resulting
stockpiling
has
depressed
the
market
.
###
But
Beijing
ca
n't
cut
back
on
such
essential
imports
as
raw
materials
for
too
long
without
hampering
the
country
's
export
business
.
###
Mr.
Kamm
,
the
China
trade
expert
,
estimates
that
as
much
as
50
%
of
Guangdong
's
exports
is
made
up
of
processed
imported
raw
materials
.
###
Oil
Spill
Case
Shows
Liability
Fund
Flaws
###
AN
UNRESOLVED
two-year-old
dispute
stemming
from
an
Alaskan
oil
spill
has
helped
spur
a
drive
for
tougher
federal
laws
to
protect
victims
of
such
accidents
.
###
The
class-action
suit
highlights
shortcomings
of
the
Trans-Alaska
Pipeline
Liability
Fund
,
which
gets
its
money
from
oil
companies
using
the
pipeline
and
compensates
those
harmed
by
oil
spills
.
###
On
July
2
,
1987
,
the
tanker
S.S.
Glacier
Bay
struck
a
rock
and
spilled
almost
150,000
gallons
of
oil
into
the
Cook
Inlet
.
###
Commercial
fishermen
and
fish
processors
filed
suit
in
federal
court
in
a
claim
that
has
ballooned
to
more
than
$
104.8
million
.
###
Defendants
include
British
Petroleum
America
;
Trinidad
Corp.
,
the
shipper
;
and
the
pipeline
liability
fund
.
###
The
fund
was
created
by
the
Trans-Alaska
Pipeline
Act
,
which
provides
that
the
owner
or
operator
of
a
vessel
involved
in
an
oil
spill
must
pay
the
first
$
14
million
in
damages
.
###
The
fund
is
required
to
pay
claims
up
to
an
additional
$
86
million
.
###
The
fund
's
purpose
is
to
provide
quick
and
adequate
relief
.
###
But
the
Glacier
Bay
case
,
the
fund
's
first
test
,
shows
how
easily
the
fund
can
be
undermined
.
###
Trinidad
Corp.
is
contesting
liability
.
###
It
claims
the
Coast
Guard
failed
to
chart
the
rock
and
refuses
to
pay
damages
.
###
That
means
the
fund
is
n't
obligated
to
pay
anything
,
at
least
so
far
.
###
The
Oil
Pollution
Act
,
scheduled
to
come
up
for
a
vote
in
Congress
this
fall
,
would
provide
that
if
claimants
are
n't
paid
within
90
days
of
a
spill
,
the
liability
fund
would
compensate
them
and
seek
reimbursement
from
the
owner
or
operator
of
the
vessel
,
says
a
spokesman
for
Rep.
George
Miller
-LRB-
D.
,
Calif.
-RRB-
,
a
sponsor
of
the
bill
.
###
The
spokesman
says
the
``
glitch
''
in
the
statute
is
``
the
worst
kind
of
Catch-22
.

###
RECENT
LAW
school
graduates
are
starting
jobs
with
law
firms
this
fall
--
and
heading
back
to
class
.
###
Bar
associations
and
consultants
are
offering
more
programs
to
teach
associates
all
they
need
to
know
about
law
but
did
n't
learn
in
law
school
.
###
``
Law
school
teaches
wonderful
theory
,
but
it
does
n't
teach
the
nuts

lawyering

''
says
Aaron
Weitz
,
head
of
a
New
York
County
Lawyers
'
Association
committee
that
sponsors
such
a
course
.
###
In
the
past
,
associates
learned
the
basics
from
senior
lawyers
who
acted
as
mentors
.
###
But
these
days
,
large
firms
hire
as
many
as
30
new
associates
a
year
,
and
it
's
impossible
to
personally
train
everyone
,
says
Joel
Henning
of
Hildebrandt
Inc.
,
a
consulting
firm
that
runs
training
classes
.
###
The
Hildebrandt
course
enables
students
to
brush
up
on
negotiation
skills
by
role
playing
in

.
###
Students
also
are

to
treat

###
Many

###
The
building
,
which
will

###
Designs
call
for
an
L-shaped
structure
with
a

.
###
There
will
be
recreation

.
###
Study

.
###
The
building
's
25
courtrooms
will
be
smaller
,
says
Charlene
Saunders
,
a
court
administrator
.
###
The
bench
will
be
lower
so
the
judge
seems
less
intimidating
,
and
walls
will
be
painted
in
bright
colors
and

.
###
Cases

###
About
45,000
children
in

are
under
court
supervision
,
Mr.
Edelman
says
,
and
an
average
of
1,500

the

conducted
by
Altman

Weil
Inc.
,
an
Ardmore

###
Its

shows
that
managing

earned
an
average
of
$
395,974
in

###
Chairman
Jamie
Whitten
-LRB-
D.
,
Miss

-RRB-
of
the

Appropriations
Committee
proposed
a
$
2.85

package
to
assist
California
's
recovery
from
last
week
's
earthquake
and
extend
further
aid
to
East
Coast
victims
of
Hurricane
Hugo
.
###
The
sweeping
measure
incorporates
$
500
million
in
small-business
loans
,
$
1
billion
in
highway-construction
funds
and
$
1.25

assistance
and
a
reserve
to
be
available
to
President

to
meet
unanticipated

###
The
funds
would
be
attached
to
a

spending
bill
required

keep
most
of

operating
past
Wednesday
.
###
The
measure

###
The

is
expected
to
add
provisions

To

leave
it

that

Nora
Worth
and
Malcolm
DeWitt
,
33
and
39
respectively
,
live
together
in
a
townhouse
in
a
transitional
Philadelphia
neighborhood
.
###
Malcolm
,
a
former
film-maker
turned
architect
,
has
just
seen
his
first
big
chance
at
a
lucrative
commission
turn
to
dust
with
the
arrest
of
his
shady
,
obnoxious
client
,
a
fly-by-night
real
estate
developer
.
###
Nora
,
who
still
has
artistic
aspirations
,
knows
she
is
lucky
to
be
working
as
a
food
stylist
,
prepping
pies
,
burgers
,
frosty
cold
drinks
and
other
comestibles
to
look
as
appetizing
as
possible
in
front
of
the
camera
.
###
After
all
,
she
reasons
,
``
there
were
housewives
with
Nikons
and
degrees
from
cooking
schools
in
France
who
would
kill
for
her
job
.
''
###
But
Nora
and
Malcolm
feel
trapped
.
###
They
seem
to
be
having
the
``
worst
of
both
worlds
:
artistic
work
with
none
of
art
's
integrity
and
no
control
over
the
finished
product
;
self-employment
without
fun
or
profit
.
''
###
It
's
a
downbeat
,
``
thirtysomething
''
world
,
in
which
bright
,
still
youngish
people
are
engaged
in
a
glossy
version
of
day
labor
,
doing
free-lance
,
semi-professional
work
that
brings
little
satisfaction
or
security
but
that
they
know
they
should
be
grateful
to
do
.
###
Uncertainty

every
aspect
of
their
lives

Malcolm
faces
bankruptcy
and
an
IRS
audit
,
but
Nora
finds
an
extra
$
30,000
in
her
bank
account
,
suddenly
increasing
her
available
funds
some
fifteenfold
.
###
While
she
is
wondering
whether
to
live
it
up
,
and
do
something
even
more
dramatic
,
say
get
married
,
her
life
is
further
complicated
by
the
reappearance
of
an
old
flame
,
David
,
a
film
critic
and
actor
who
always
seems
to
be
just
on
the
brink
of
stardom
.
###
In
novels
of
an
earlier
vintage
,
David
would
have
represented
excitement
and
danger
;
Malcolm
,
placid
,
middle-class
security
.
###
The
irony
in
this
novel
is
that
neither
man
represents
a
``
safe
''
middle-class
haven
:
Nora
's
decision
is
between
emotional
excitement
and
emotional
security
,
with
no
firm
economic
base
anywhere
.
###
The
characters
confront
a
world
in
which
it
seems
increasingly
difficult
to
find
a
``
middle
way
''
between
the
extremes
of
success
and
failure
,
wealth
and
poverty
.
###
In
making
Malcolm
and
Nora
such
wonderfully
representative
specimens
of
their
class
and
generation
,
Ms.
Zeidner
has
somewhat
neglected
the
task
of
making
them
distinctively
individual
characters
.
###
The
humor
of
the
story
owes
much
to
the
fact
that
no
hearts
-LRB-
even
the
characters
'
own
-RRB-
are
likely
to
bleed
for
the
plight
of
health-food
eaters
.
###
But
readers
may
well
feel
the
pangs
of
recognition
.
###
In
any
case
,
the
foundering
middle
classes
are
n't
the
only
ones
in
trouble
--
or
whose
troubles
provide
material
for
fiction
.

-RRB-
,
a

by

Joseph
R.
Garber
,
tells
the
story
of
an
innovative
,
well-run
,
widely
respected
computer
manufacturing
company
called
PegaSys
as
it
faces
a
hostile
takeover
attempt
by
AIW
,
a
much
smaller
corporation
that
is
so
incompetently
managed
as
to
constitute
a
standing
joke
in
the
business
world
.
###
Patrician
dynamic
Scott
Thatcher
,
,
initially
finds
the
takeover
threat
risible
.
###
But
,
as
he
and
his
skilled
team
soon
discover
,
they
're
up
against
two
factors
they
had
n't
counted
on
:
first
,
a
business
climate
in
which
a
failing
company
with
few
assets
and
many
debts
can
borrow
against
the
assets
of
the
successful
company
it
hopes
to
acquire
in
order
to
finance
the
takeover
;
second
,
that
standing
behind
AIW
is
a
sinister
consortium
of
much
bigger
,
shadier
and
shrewder
foreign
interests
secretly
providing
the
money
and
muscle
for
the
deal
.
###
Mr.
Garber
manages
to
invest
this
tale
of
financial
wars
with
the
colorful
characters
and
fast-paced
action
of
a
suspense
novel
.
###
And
like
a
spy
or
mystery
story
,
this
novel
has
strong
elements
of
allegory
,
as
the
good
and
evil
forces
battle
it
out
.
###
Mr.
Garber
depicts
these
moral
qualities
with
the
broad
brush
strokes
of
a
satire
that
occasionally
descends
to
the
realm
of
cliched
caricatures
.
###
Standard-issue
portraits
of
flaky
Californians
,
snobbish
homosexuals
and
Neanderthal
union
leaders
undermine
the
force
of
the
author
's
perceptions
.
###
Yet
the
heavy-handedness
of
the
satire
also
can
be
effective
in
a
book
like
this
:
If
the
head
of
AIW
were
not
portrayed
as
an
utterly
contemptible
,
malicious
dolt
,
we
would
not
much
care
whether
his
schemes
were
defeated
,
and
would
not
be
so
diverted
in
the
process
.

High-definition
television
promises
to
be
the
TV
of
tomorrow
,
so
it
is
a
natural
multibillion-dollar
market
.
###
Although
major
U.S.
manufacturers
have
all
but
ceded
the
main
segment
of
that
future
business
to
Japan
,
not
everyone
here
is
ready
to
give
up
.
###
A
handful
of
small
U.S.
companies
are
struggling
to
develop
the
technology
to
build
the
screens
for
the
thin
,
high-quality
televisions
that
are
expected
to
hang
on
living
room
walls
by
the
end
of
the
1990s
.
###
With
only
small
help
from
the
government
,
these
start-up
concerns
are
trying
to
compete
with
the
Goliaths
of
the
Japanese
consumer
electronics
industry
,
which
enjoy
considerable
backing
from
the
Japanese
government
.
###
Photonics
Technology
Inc.
of
Northwood
,
Ohio
,
aims
to
use
a
new
form
of
plasma
technology
to
put
movie-quality
images
on
a
TV
display
that
is
40
inches
in
diameter
but
only
a
few
inches
thick
.
###
Planar
Systems
Inc.
of
Beaverton
,
Ore.
,
the
largest
of
these
firms
,
with
$
20
million
in
annual
revenue
,
has
similar
plans
.
###
It
already
has
had
success
in
electroluminescence
,
another
promising
technology
adaptable
for
high-definition
television
.
###
Two
other
firms
,
Ovonic
Imaging
Systems
Inc.
of
Troy
,
Mich.
,
and
Magnascreen
Corp.
of
Pittsburgh
are
developing
a
variation
of
the
flat-panel
screens
called
active-matrix
liquid
crystal
displays
.
###
The
new
technologies
are
intended
to
retire
the
cathode-ray
tube
,
which
accounts
for
most
of
the
bulk
of
the
conventional
TV
set
.
###
Replacing
the
cathode-ray
tube
with
a
large
,
thin
screen
is
the
key
to
the
creation
of
a
high-definition
television
,
or
HDTV
,
which
is
expected
to
become
a
$
30
billion
business
world-wide
within
a
decade
.
###
Large
U.S.
companies
are
interested
in
other
segments
of
the
HDTV
business
,
such
as
signal-processing
and
broadcast
equipment
.
###
But
except
for
Zenith
Electronics
Corp.
and
International
Business
Machines
Corp.
,
which
is
collaborating
with
Toshiba
on
computer
displays
,
they
are
poorly
positioned
to
exploit
advances
in
large
panels
.
###
General
Electric
Co.
recently
sold
off
its
interests
in
liquid-crystal
displays
to
Thompson-CSF
of
France
.
###
``
We
found
the
market
not
developing
as
we
thought
it
would
,
''
a
GE
spokesman
says
.
###
The
small
U.S.
firms
are
persisting
because
of
their
strong
positions
in
patents
,
and
because
the
prize
is
still
there
to
be
seized
.
###
``
No
one
yet
has
shown
the
ability
to
manufacture
these
panels
''
at
commercial
costs
,
says
Zvi
Yaniv
,
the
president
of
Ovonic
Imaging
.
###
He
says
he
thinks
his
company
is
just
a
few
years
from
doing
that
.
###
The
Bush
administration
,
hearing
conflicting
advice
about
what
its
role
in
HDTV
should
be
,
is
n't
doing
much
for
now
.
###
The
only
material
support
it
is
extending
to
the
struggling
U.S.
industry
is
$
30
million
in
awards
from
the
Pentagon
's
Defense
Advanced
Research
Projects
Agency
.
###
The
DARPA
funds
are
a
pittance
compared
with
what
Japan
and
other
prospective
competitors
are
spending
.
###
The
Commerce
Department
estimates
that
Japanese
government
and
industry
spending
on
HDTV
research
is
already
over
$
1
billion
.
###
``
Unless
it
gets
more
help
,
the
U.S.
industry
wo
n't
have
a
chance
,
''
says
Peter
Friedman
,
Photonics
's
executive
vice
president
.
###
Thus
far
,
almost
all
of
the
basic
technology
relating
to
high-definition
television
has
come
from
U.S.
laboratories
.
###
But
Peter
Brody
,
Magnascreen
's
president
,
says
Japanese
companies
are
poised
to
snatch
the
technology
and
put
it
to
commercial
use
,
just
as
they
did
with
earlier
U.S.
innovations
in
color
television
and
video
recording
.
###
In
the
1970s
,
Mr.
Brody
helped
develop
the
first
display
panels
based
on
active-matrix
liquid
crystals
at
Westinghouse
Electric
Corp.
's
research
labs
in
Pittsburgh
.
###
The
panels
are
like
oversized
semiconductors
surfaced
with
a
million
or
more
picture
elements
,
each
contributing
to
the
color
and
tone
of
a
TV
image
.
###
In
1979
,
however
,
Westinghouse
abandoned
the
project
along
with
its
stake
in
advanced
television
.
###
Mr.
Brody
left
the
company
to
find
other
backers
.
###
He
has
a
claim
to
the
right
to
commercialize
the
Westinghouse
patents
,
but
he
contends
that
those
patents
are
being
infringed
by
a
number
of
Japanese
producers
.
###
``
Most
American
investors
have
just
given
up
,
''
Mr.
Brody
says
.
###
They
are
n't
prepared
to
compete
in
an
area
where
the
Japanese
want
to
enter
.
''
###
Many
critics
question
the
industry
's
need
for
federal
support
;
the
Pentagon
justifies
its
help
on
national-security
grounds
.
###
``
We
do
n't
see
a
domestic
source
for
some
of
our
-LCB-
HDTV
-RCB-
requirements
,
and
that
's
a
source
of
concern
,
''
says
Michael
Kelly
,
director
of
DARPA
's
defense
manufacturing
office
.
###
So
DARPA
is
trying
to
keep
the
industry
interested
in
developing
large
display
panels
by
doling
out
research
funds
.
###
HDTV
already
has
some
military
applications
,
such
as
creating
realistic
flight
simulations
and
transmitting
information
to
combat
commanders
.
###
The
Navy
is
ordering
displays
for
its
Aegis
cruisers
and
the
Army
wants
smaller
versions
for
its
Abrams
battle
tanks
.
###
The
Commerce
Department
also
is
trying
to
encourage
HDTV
because
of
the
benefits
that
could
spin
off
to
the
semiconductor
and
computer
industries
.
###
``
It
is
n't
just
yuppie
television
,
''
argues
Jack
Clifford
,
director
of
the
department
's
office
of
microelectronics
and
instrumentation
.
###
The
industry
will
create
industrial
products
such
as
displays
for
work
stations
and
medical
diagnostic
equipment
before
it
acquires
a
mass
consumer
market
.
''
###
Although
some
HDTV
advocates
are
calling
for
other
forms
of
aid
,
such
as
antitrust
relief
for
research
consortia
,
the
small
firms
simply
would
prefer
more
DARPA
funds
.
###
Each
claims
to
possess
the
right
technology
and
wants
just
a
bit
more
money
to
make
it
commercial
.
###
They
also
want
U.S.
trade
policy
to
reflect
the
Pentagon
and
Commerce
department
's
concern
over
their
future
.
###
They
all
are
strongly
opposed
to
a
petition
from
several
Japanese
TV
manufacturers
,
including
Matsushita
,
Hitachi
,
and
Toshiba
,
to
exempt
portable
color
TVs
with
liquid-crystal
displays
from
anti-dumping
duties
that
the
U.S.
imposes
on
the
larger
Japanese
color
TVs
.
###
And
they
want
the
U.S.
to
help
them
sell
overseas
.
###
Planar
President
James
Hurd
says
he
has
to
pay
tariffs
as
high
as
15
%
to
sell
his
display
panels
in
Japan
and
South
Korea
,
while
panels
from
those
countries
enter
the
U.S.
duty-free
.
###
``
This
is
n't
a
technology
issue
,
but
an
attitude
issue
,
''
he
says
.
###
We
just
have
n't
learned
what
it
takes
to
compete
.

The

a

that

,
said
this
was
the
first
announcement
of
an
enforcement
action
since
this
year
's
thrift-bailout
legislation
ordered
that
all
such
actions
by
federal

regulators
be
made
public
.
###
Generally
,
regulators
have
n't
announced
enforcement
actions
in
the
past
.
###
Indeed
,
the
OTS
said
that
before
the
law
took
effect
Aug.
9
,
it
banned
another
``
key
Vision

insider
''
from
insured
financial

say
specifically
why
the

it
said

including
``
extraordinary

paid

compared

a

The

maker

fuel-storage
systems
said
the
most
recent
period
was
affected
by
customers
'
problems
complying
with
recent
Environmental
Protection
Agency
regulations
.
###
For
the

the

a
net
loss
of
about
$
879,000

on

###
Growth
is
good
.
###
At
least
,
that
's
a
theme
emerging
among
many
money
managers
who
are
anxious
both
to
preserve
the
handsome
stock-market
gains
they
have
already
achieved
this
year
and
to
catch
the
next
wave
of
above-average
performers
.
###
They
are
starting
to
buy
growth
stocks
.
###
Remember
them
?
###
The
upper
echelon
of
this
group
were
shares
of
the
``
nifty
50
''
companies
whose
profits
of
the
1960s
and
early
1970s
grew
steadily
,
if
not
spectacularly
,
through
thick
and
thin
.
###
That
sort
of
workhorse
performance
sounds
made
to
order
for
a
time
when
corporate
profits
overall
have
been
weakening
from
the
brisk
increases
of
recent
years
.
###
The
current
flood
of
third-quarter
reports
are
producing
many
more
negative
surprises
than
positive
ones
.
###
Those
are
unwelcome
trends
in
a
year
that
the
Dow
Jones
Industrial
Average
has
risen
23
%
so
far
,
even
with
the
190.58-point
plunge
on
Oct.
13
;
broader
market
measures
are
in
the
same
neighborhood
.
###
The
question
for
investors
is
,
how
to
protect
these
returns
and
yet
reach
a
little
for
additional
gains
.
###
That
's
the
path
of
reasoning
leading
to
growth
stocks
.
###
``
I
think
it
is
a
good
theme
for
what
looks
to
be
an
uncertain
market
,
''
says
Steven
Einhorn
,
partner
at
Goldman
Sachs
.
###
Growth
stocks
may
be
as
big
as
Philip
Morris
or
medium-sized
such
as
Circuit
City
Stores
,
but
their
common
characteristic
is
a
history
of
increasing
profits
on
the
order
of
at
least
15
%
to
20
%
a
year
,
money
managers
say
.
###
``
The
period
when
growth
stocks
should
be
performing
well
is
when
their
earnings
are
growing
at
a
superior
rate
to
the
general
level
of
corporate
profits
,
''
says
Stephen
Boesel
,
president
of
T.
Rowe
Price
's
Growth
and
Income
Fund
.
###
Growth
stocks
also
are
attractive
in
periods
of
market
volatility
,
which
many
investors
and
analysts
expect
in
the
weeks
ahead
as
everybody
tries
to
discern
where
the
economy
is
heading
.
###
This
kind
of
jumpy
uncertainty
reminds
John
Calverley
,
senior
economist
for
American
Express
Bank
,
of
the
1969-72
period
,
when
the
industrial
average
rolled
through
huge
ranges
and
investors
flocked
to
the
shares
of
companies
with
proven
earnings
records
,
which
became
known
as
the
``
nifty
50
.
''
###
And
they
will
again
,
say
money-manager
proponents
of
the
growth-stock
theme
.
###
Cabanne
Smith
,
president
of
a
money
management
company
bearing
his
name
,
predicts
that
investment
companies
using
computers
to
identify
companies
with
earnings
``
momentum
''
will
climb
on
the
growth-stock
bandwagon
as
the
overall
corporate
earnings
outlook
deteriorates
further
.
###
He
also
thinks
foreign
investors
,
who
are
showing
signs
of
more
discriminate
investing
,
will
join
the
pursuit
and
pump
up
prices
.
###
``
We
're
just
seeing
the
beginning
of
a
shift
,
''
Mr.
Smith
says
.
###
Mr.
Smith
recommends
Cypress
Semiconductor
that
is
currently
showing
a
robust
63
%
earnings
growth
rate
.
###
Ronald
Sloan
,
executive
vice
president
of
Siebel
Capital
Management
,
likes
Wellman
Inc.
,
a
company
that
recycles
plastic
into
synthetic
fibers
for
carpeting
.
###
Mr.
Sloan
praises
the
company
as
recession
resistant
and
notes
that
it
has
an
annual
earnings
growth
rate
of
32
%
a
year
over
the
past
five
years
.
###
Wellman
stock
closed
Friday
at
39
,
up
;
Mr.
Sloan
thinks
that
in
a
year
it
could
hit
60
.
###
Others
preach
the
gospel
of
buying
only
blue-chip
growth
stocks
.
###
Carmine
Grigoli
,
chief
market
strategist
for
First
Boston
,
who
still
says
,
``
We
expect
the
Dow
average
-LCB-
to
be
at
-RCB-
3000
by
mid-1990
,
''
nonetheless
foresees
a
sluggish
economy
in
the
meantime
.
###
He
recommends
such
blue-chip
growth
stalwarts
as
Philip
Morris
,
PepsiCo
,
CPC
International
,
Reebok
International
,
and
Limited
Inc
.
###
All
have
a
fiveyear
earnings
growth
rate
of
more
than
20
%
a
year
.
###
Some
money
managers
are
pursuing
growth
stocks
at
the
expense
of
those
that
rise
and
fall
along
with
the
economic
cycle
.
###
``
One
of
the
stories
of
the
fourth
quarter
is
that
we
will
get
an
unusual
number
of
earnings
disappointments
from
companies
sensitive
to
the
economy
,
''
says
Mr.
Boesel
of
T.
Rowe
Price
.
###
James
Wright
,
chief
investment
officer
for
Banc
One
Asset
Management
,
says
,
``
We
've
been
selling
a
disproportionate
share
of
cyclical
companies
and
buying
a
disproportionate
share
of
high
earnings
stocks
.
''
###
He
recently
trimmed
his
portfolio
of
International
Paper
,
Dow
Chemical
,
Quantum
Chemical
,
International
Business
Machines
and
Digital
Equipment
.
###
He
is
putting
money
in
Dress
Barn
,
Circuit
City
Stores
,
Bruno
's
,
and
Rubbermaid
.
###
Big
cyclical
companies
are
using
``
all
the
tricks
they
can
to
stabilize
earnings
,
''
says
Mr.
Sloan
.
###
He
cites
IBM
,
which
reported
a
30
%
earnings
decline
in
the
third
quarter
,
and
which
last
week
announced
a
$
1
billion
buy-back
of
its
shares
.
###
``
What
they
are
telling
you
is
that
they
do
n't
have
the
ability
to
generate
higher
returns
internally
,
''
says
Mr.
Sloan
.
###
``
When
they
are
buying
back
stock
at
10
times
earnings
,
they
are
suggesting
that
the
rate
of
return
on
competing
internal
projects
is
below
''
returns
on
the
stock
.
###
IBM
says
it
considers
its
shares
a
good
investment
.
###
But
not
all
strategists
or
money
managers
are
ready
to
throw
in
the
towel
completely
on
cyclicals
.
###
Growth
stocks
may
underperform
cyclical
stocks
next
year
if
the
Federal
Reserve
begins
to
let
interest
rates
drift
sufficiently
lower
to
boost
the
economy
.
###
Goldman
Sachs
's
Mr.
Einhorn
,
for
one
,
subscribes
to
that
scenario
.
###
He
suggests
investors
think
about
buying
cyclical
shares
in
the
weeks
ahead
,
as
well
as
growth
issues
.

Activity

###
But
there
were
fewer

Buy

were

But
block

money

made
a
concerted
effort
to
meet
the

with

sell
,
one
trader
said
.
###
As
a
result

the
Dow

Most
of
last

surge
in
the
industrial

came
on
Monday
,
when
the

rose
88.12
points
as

snapped
up

shunned

was
reflected
in
the
smaller

from

The

###
The
collapse
of
a
$
6.79
billion
buy-out
of
United
Airlines
parent
UAL
Corp.
has
handed
Wall
Street
's
takeover
stock
speculators
their
worst
loss
ever
on
a
single
deal
.
###
Their
$
700
million-plus
in
estimated
paper
losses
easily
tops
the
$
400
million
in
paper
losses
the
takeover
traders
,
known
as
arbitragers
,
suffered
in
1982
when
Gulf
Oil
Co.
dropped
a
$
4.8
billion
offer
for
Cities
Service
Co
.
###
In
the
six
trading
days
since
the
UAL
labor-management
buy-out
group
failed
to
get
bank
financing
,
culminating
Friday
with
the
withdrawal
of
its
partner
British
Airways
PLC
,
UAL
stock
has
plummeted
by
41
%
to
168
from
285
.
###
The
arbs
may
recoup
some
of
their
paper
losses
if
the
UAL
deal
gets
patched
up
again
,
as
they
did
in
1982
when
Occidental
Petroleum
Co.
rescued
them
with
a
$
4
billion
takeover
of
Cities
Service
.
###
In
the
meantime
,
the
question
faced
by
investors
is
:
What
is
UAL
stock
worth
?
###
The
short
answer
,
on
a
fundamental
basis
,
is
that
airline
analysts
say
the
stock
is
worth
somewhere
between
$
135
and
$
150
a
share
.
###
That
's
based
on
a
multiple
of
anywhere
between
8.5
to
10
times
UAL
earnings
,
which
are
estimated
to
come
in
somewhere
around
$
16
a
share
this
year
.
###
Airline
stocks
typically
sell
at
a
discount
of
about
one-third
to
the
stock
market
's
price-earnings
ratio
--
which
is
currently
about
13
times
earnings
.
###
That
's
because
airline
earnings
,
like
those
of
auto
makers
,
have
been
subject
to
the
cyclical
ups-and-downs
of
the
economy
.
###
That
analysis
matches
up
with
stock
traders
'
reports
that
,
despite
the
huge
drop
in
the
stock
,
UAL
has
n't
returned
to
the
level
at
which
it
could
attract
buying
by
institutions
solely
on
the
basis
of
earnings
.
###
So
anyone
buying
the
stock
now
is
betting
on
some
special
transaction
such
as
a
recapitalization
or
takeover
,
and
must
do
so
using
some
guesswork
about
the
likelihood
of
such
an
event
.
###
One
analyst
,
who
asked
not
to
be
identified
,
said
he
believes
that
the
UAL
pilots
and
management
can
put
together
a
bid
``
in
the
$
225
area
,
''
but
that
it
could
take
three
to
four
months
to
close
.
###
At
that
level
,
and
given
the
uncertainty
,
he
believes
UAL
stock
should
trade
closer
to
###
Other
observers
note
that
UAL
's
board
,
having
accepted
a
bid
of
$
300
a
share
,
might
hold
out
for
a
new
bid
much
closer
to
the
original
level
--
even
if
it
means
that
the
management
goes
back
to
running
the
company
for
a
while
and
lets
things
return
to
normal
.
###
By
that
logic
,
the
closing
of
a
deal
could
be
much
further
away
than
three
to
four
months
,
even
though
the
eventual
price
might
be
higher
.
###
Investment
bankers
following
UAL
agree
that
the
strongest
impetus
for
an
eventual
deal
is
that
the
pilots
have
been
attempting
a
buy-out
for
more
than
two
years
,
and
are
n't
likely
to
stop
,
having
come
so
close
to
success
.
###
The
pilots
have
a
strong
financing
tool
in
their
willingness
to
cut
their
annual
compensation
by
$
200
million
,
and
to
commit
$
200
million
from
their
retirement
funds
.
###
On
Friday
,
they
also
persuaded
the
UAL
flight
attendants
to
join
them
.
###
However
,
investment
bankers
say
that
banks
are
n't
likely
to
lend
the
almost
$
5
billion
that
would
be
necessary
for
a
takeover
even
at
a
lower
price
without
someone
putting
up
a
hefty
wad
of
cash
--
probably
even
greater
than
the
17
%
in
cash
put
up
by
investors
in
the
leveraged
takeover
of
Northwest
Airlines
parent
NWA
Corp.
in
July
.
###
Banks
want
to
see
someone
putting
up
real
cash
at
risk
,
that
is
,
subordinate
to
the
bank
debt
in
any
deal
.
###
That
way
,
they
figure
,
someone
else
has
an
even
stronger
motivation
to
make
sure
the
deal
is
going
to
work
,
because
they
would
be
losing
their
money
before
the
banks
lost
theirs
.
###
Banks
also
want
to
be
able
to
call
someone
on
the
telephone
to
fix
a
problem
with
a
deal
that
goes
bad
--
preferably
someone
other
than
a
union
leader
.
###
That
leaves
the
pilots
still
in
need
of
cash
totaling
around
$
1
billion
--
far
more
than
either
they
or
the
flight
attendants
can
lay
their
hands
on
from
retirement
funds
alone
.
###
One
obstacle
to
the
pilots
'
finding
such
a
huge
amount
of
cash
is
their
insistence
on
majority
ownership
.
###
Investors
such
as
Marvin
Davis
of
Los
Angeles
who
have
sought
airline
ownership
this
year
have
insisted
they
,
not
the
pilots
,
must
have
control
.
###
One
way
out
of
that
dilemma
could
be
a
partial
recapitalization
in
which
the
pilots
would
wind
up
sharing
the
value
of
their
concessions
with
public
shareholders
.
###
The
pilots
could
borrow
against
the
value
of
their
concessions
,
using
the
proceeds
to
buy
back
stock
from
the
public
and
give
themselves
the
majority
control
they
have
been
seeking
.
###
But
it
is
n't
clear
that
banks
would
lend
sufficient
money
to
deliver
a
big
enough
price
to
shareholders
.
###
The
lack
of
any
new
cash
probably
would
still
leave
the
banks
dissatisfied
.
###
In
advising
the
UAL
board
on
the
various
bids
for
the
airline
,
starting
with
one
for
$
240
a
share
from
Mr.
Davis
,
the
investment
bank
of
First
Boston
came
up
with
a
wide
range
of
potential
values
for
the
company
,
depending
on
appraisal
methods
and
assumptions
.
###
Using
the
the
NWA
takeover
as
a
benchmark
,
First
Boston
on
Sept.
14
estimated
that
UAL
was
worth
$
250
to
$
344
a
share
based
on
UAL
's
results
for
the
12
months
ending
last
June
30
,
but
only
$
235
to
$
266
based
on
a
management
estimate
of
results
for
1989
.
###
First
Boston
's
estimates
had
been
higher
before
management
supplied
a
1989
projection
.
###
Using
estimates
of
the
company
's
future
earnings
under
a
variety
of
scenarios
,
First
Boston
estimated
UAL
's
value
at
$
248
to
$
287
a
share
if
its
future
labor
costs
conform
to
Wall
Street
projections
;
$
237
to
$
275
if
the
company
reaches
a
settlement
with
pilots
similar
to
one
at
NWA
;
$
98
to
$
121
under
an
adverse
labor
settlement
,
and
$
229
to
$
270
under
a
pilot
contract
imposed
by
the
company
following
a
strike
.
###
And
using
liquidation
value
assuming
the
sale
of
all
UAL
assets
,
First
Boston
estimated
the
airline
is
worth
$
253
to
$
303
a
share
.
###
Unfortunately
,
all
those
estimates
came
before
airline
industry
fundamentals
deteriorated
during
the
past
month
.
###
American
Airlines
parent
AMR
and
USAir
Group
,
both
subject
to
takeover
efforts
themselves
,
have
each
warned
of
declining
results
.
###
Some
analysts
do
n't
expect
a
quick
revival
of
any
takeover
by
the
pilots
.
###
The
deal
has
,
as
one
takeover
expert
puts
it
,
``
so
many
moving
parts
.
###
I
do
n't
see
anybody
who
's
sophisticated
getting
his
name
associated
with
this
mess
until
the
moving
parts
stop
moving
.
''
###
In
addition
to
the
need
for
another
cash
equity
investor
,
the
other
moving
parts
include
:
the
pilots
themselves
,
who
can
scuttle
rival
deals
by
threatening
to
strike
;
the
machinists
union
,
the
pilots
'
longtime
rivals
who
helped
scuttle
the
pilots
'
deal
;
and
regulators
in
Washington
,
whose
opposition
to
foreign
airline
investment
helped
throw
the
deal
into
doubt
.
###
In
the
meantime
,
the
arbs
are
bleeding
.
###
Wall
Street
traders
and
analysts
estimate

Most

Troubled
Saatchi
&
Saatchi
Co.
has
attracted
offers
for
some
of
its
advertising
units
,
with
potential
suitors
including
Interpublic
Group
,
but
has
rejected
them
,
people
familiar
with
the
company
said
.
###
Industry
executives
said
Interpublic
approached
Saatchi
in
August
about
buying
its
Campbell-Mithun-Esty
unit
,
but
was
turned
down
by
Chairman
Maurice
Saatchi
.
###
More
recently
,
Interpublic
inquired
about
one
of
Saatchi
's
smaller
communications
companies
--
identified
as
the
Rowland
public
relations
firm
by
several
industry
executives
--
but
again
was
rebuffed
,
they
said
.
###
Interpublic
's
chairman
and
chief
executive
officer
,
Philip
Geier
Jr.
,
made
the
pitches
in
visits
to
Mr.
Saatchi
in
London
,
the
executives
said
.
###
A
Saatchi
spokesman
declined
to
comment
about
Interpublic
.
###
But
the
spokesman
confirmed
that
Saatchi
has
received
several
inquiries
from
companies
interested
in
acquiring
its
Campbell-Mithun
and
Rowland
units
.
###
He
added
,
``
We
have
no
intention
of
selling
either
business
.
''
###
Interpublic
declined
comment
.
###
The
offers
come
as
Saatchi
is
struggling
through
the
most
troubled
period
in
its
19-year
history
.
###
Takeover
speculation
has
been
rife
,
its
consulting
business
is
on
the
block
,
and
its
largest
shareholder
,
Southeastern
Asset
Management
,
has
said
it
's
been
approached
by
third
parties
regarding
a
possible
restructuring
.
###
Analysts
have
continually
lowered
their
earnings
estimates
for
the
company
,
and
their
outlook
,
at
least
for
the
short
term
,
is
bleak
.
###
In
the
midst
of
the
current
turmoil
,
Saatchi
is
attempting
to
shore
up
its
ad
businesses
.
###
It
named
a
new
chief
executive
officer
,
former
IMS
International
head
Robert
Louis-Dreyfus
.
###
It
rebuffed
an
offer
by
Carl
Spielvogel
,
head
of
Saatchi
's
Backer
Spielvogel
Bates
unit
,
to
lead
a
management
buy-out
of
all
or
part
of
Saatchi
.
###
And
last
week
,
people
close
to
Saatchi
said
Maurice
Saatchi
and
his
brother
,
Charles
,
would
lead
a
buy-out
if
a
hostile
bid
emerged
.
###
But
Saatchi
's
troubles
have
only
whipped
up
interest
among
outsiders
interested
in
picking
off
pieces
of
its
ad
businesses
.
###
While
Saatchi
's
major
agency
networks
--
Backer
Spielvogel
and
Saatchi
&
Saatchi
Advertising
--
would
be
difficult
for
any
ad
firm
to
buy
because
of
potential
client
conflicts
,
its
smaller
businesses
are
quite
attractive
.
###
Campbell-Mithun-Esty
,
for
example
,
has
had
big
problems
at
its
New
York
office
,
but
offers
strong
offices
in
other
areas
of
the
country
,
including
Minneapolis
and
Chicago
.
###
That
would
would
make
it
appealing
to
a
network
such
as
Interpublic
that
already
has
a
healthy
New
York
presence
.
###
While
there
would
be
some
client
conflicts
,
they
would
n't
be
nearly
as
onerous
as
with
Saatchi
's
other
agencies
.
-RRB-
###
Campbell-Mithun
also
would
be
a
sizable
addition
to
an
agency
network
:
It
has
billings
of
about
$
850
million
and
blue-chip
clients
including
General
Mills
,
and
Dow
Brands
.
###
Rowland
,
meanwhile
,
has
expanded
aggressively
,
and
now
ranks
as
the
fifth-largest
U.S.
public
relations
firm
,
according
to
O'Dwyer's
Directory
of
Public
Relations
Firms
.
###
It
would
be
attractive
to
an
agency
such
as
Interpublic
,
one
of
the
few
big
agency
groups
without
an
affiliated
public
relations
firm
of
its
own
.
###
Other
Saatchi
units
include
ad
agency
McCaffrey
&
McCall
,
which
has
the
Mercedes
account
and
which
has
been
attempting
to
buy
itself
back
;
and
Howard
Marlboro
,
a
sports
and
event
marketing
firm
.
###
Despite
Saatchi
's
firm
stand
against
selling
its
ad
units
,
U.S.
analysts
believe
the
company
may
ultimately
sell
some
of
the
smaller
units
.
###
Mr.
Louis-Dreyfus
,
in
a
recent
interview
,
said
he
might
sell
``
a
marginal
agency
or
office
.
''
###
Analysts
believe
he
may
ultimately
dispose
of
some
of
the
non-advertising
businesses
.
###
Prudential
's
Final
Four
###
Prudential
Insurance
Co.
of
America
said
it
selected
four
agencies
to
pitch
its
$
60
million
to
$
70
million
account
.
###
In
addition
to
Backer
Spielvogel
Bates
,
a
Saatchi
unit
that
has
handled
the
account
since
1970
,
the
other
agencies
include
Lowe
Marschalk
,
a
unit
of
the
Lowe
Group
;
Grey
Advertising
;
and
WPP

's
Scali
,
McCabe

for

insurance
and
financial
services
firm

Jamaica
Fires
Back
###
The
Jamaica
Tourist
Board
,
in
the
wake
of
Young
&
Rubicam
's
indictment
on
charges
that
it
bribed
Jamaican
officials
to
win
the
account
in
1981
,
released
a
scathing
memo
blaming
the
agency
for
the
embarrassing
incident
.
###
The
memo
attempts
to
remove
the
tourist
board
as
far
as
possible
from
the
agency
,
which
pleaded
innocent
to
the
charges
.
###
Among
other
things
,
the
memo
contends
that
Young
&
Rubicam
gave
false
assurances
that
the
investigation
would
n't
uncover
any
information
that
would
``
embarrass
the
government
of
Jamaica
or
the
Jamaica
Tourist
Board
.
''
###
It
also
contends
that
Young
&
Rubicam
never
told
the
tourist
board
about
its
relationship
with
Ad
Ventures
,
a
Jamaican
firm
hired
by
the
agency
.
###
The
U.S.
indictment
charges
Ad
Ventures
was
a
front
used
to
funnel
kickbacks
to
the
then-minister
of
tourism
.
###
The
memo
also
chastises
the
agency
for
the
timing
of
its
announcement
Thursday
that
it
would
no
longer
handle
the
$
5
million
to
$
6
million
account
.
###
The
agency
declined
comment
,
but
said
it
will
continue
work
until
a
new
agency
is
chosen

###
David
Baltimore
,
who
has
just
been
named
president
of
Rockefeller
University
,
already
knows
what
it
's
like
to
go
through
life
with
``
Nobel
laureate
''
appended
to
one
's
name
.
###
He
is
currently
experiencing
what
it
's
like
to
have
the
phrase
,
``
under
investigation
for
scientific
fraud
,
''
also
attached
to
his
name
.
###
The
Nobel
committee
made
the
first
addition
;
John
Dingell
's
congressional
committee
created
the
second
.
###
Both
of
Dr.
Baltimore
's
public
faces
have
been
on
view
the
past
few
weeks
while
he
was
under
consideration
to
succeed
Joshua
Lederberg
as
head
of
the
prestigious
Rockefeller
research
institution
.
###
It
came
to
light
that
a
substantial
number
of
Rockefeller
's
faculty
were
upset
over
or
even
opposed
to
Dr.
Baltimore
's
impending
appointment
.
###
They
were
disturbed
at
what
they
regarded
as
Dr.
Baltimore
's
confrontational
attitude
toward
the
Dingell
committee
,
which
held
hearings
on
a
dispute
over
the
lab
notebooks
of
a
researcher
who
had
co-authored
a
scientific
paper
with
Dr.
Baltimore
.
###
Readers
of
these
columns
-LRB-
``
The
Science
Police
,
''
May

-RRB-
will
recall
that
Dr.
Baltimore
was
merely
the
most
well-known
part
of
the
Dingell
committee
's
larger
investigation
,
which
touched
MIT
,
Tufts
,
Duke
,
the
National
Institutes
of
Health
and
elsewhere
.
###
Rep.
Dingell
even
managed
to
enlist
the
services
of
the
Secret
Service
in
his
investigation
of
the
Baltimore
paper
.
###
Insofar
as
Mr.
Dingell
has
a
special
interest
in
NIH
and
the
institutions
that
receive
its
funding
,
the
Rockefeller
scientists
were
no
doubt
discomfited
by
Dr.
Baltimore
's
unflattering
public
opinion
of
this
congressional
patron
,
whose
behavior
reminded
Dr.
Baltimore
of
the
McCarthy
era
.
###
This
well
may
be
the
first
time
that
the
venerable
Rockefeller
University
has
brushed
up
publicly
against
the
intimidations
now
common
in
American
science
.

are

still
think
that

movement
in
this
country
is

their

could

,
by
the
way

has
decreed

speaking
out

Scientists
need
to
understand

while
they
tend
to
believe
their
work

primarly
about

today
it

In

may

Roland

George

is
quite
clear
:
No
new

.
###
But
what
about
all
those
non-duck
ducks
flapping
over
Washington
?
###
We
see
a
whole
flock
of
programs
that
will
impose
significant
costs
on
the
American
economy
in
the
form
of
burdensome
regulation
and
higher
liabilities

###
The
Bush
White
House
is
breeding
non-duck
ducks
the
same
way
the
Nixon
White
House
did
:
It
hops
on
an
issue
that
is
unopposable
--
cleaner
air
,
better
treatment
of
the
disabled
,
better
child
care
.
###
It
comes
up
with
a
toned-down
version
of
a
Democratic
proposal
.
###
The
bill
gets
signed
into
law
and
then
the
administration
watches
helplessly
,
wondering
where
all
the
``
unexpected
''
costs
came
from
.
###
Consider
,
for
instance
,
the
very
fat
fowl
known
as
federalized
child
care
.
###
The
President
came
up
with
a
good
bill
,
but
now
may
end
up
signing
the
awful
bureaucratic
creature
hatched
on
Capitol
Hill
.
###
It
would
create
38,000
local
day-care
commissions
,
answerable
to
the
Department
of
Health
and
Human
Services
.
###
They
'd
determine
where
parents
could
store
their
kids
during
the
day
,
and
they
'd
regulate
the
storage
facilities
.
###
The
initial
costs
are
said
to
be
in
the
$
2
billion
a
year
range
,
but
that
's
only
the
beginning
.
###
New
entitlements
tend
to
grow
,
creating
a
rationale
for
new
taxes
.
###
The
administration
claims
that
its
Clean
Air
bill
will
cost
businesses
between
$
14
billion
and
$
19
billion
annually
,
but
economist
Michael
Evans
estimates
that
the
costs
for
firms
will
actually
be
in
the
$
60
billion
a
year
range
.
###
The
House
bill
also
distorts
economic
efficiency
in
all
sorts
of
perverse
ways
.
###
For
example
,
the
administration
proposal
imposes
extremely
tough
emissions
standards
on
new
power
plants
.
###
So
instead
of
building
more
efficient
modern
plants
,
utilities
stick
scrubbers
on
the
old
plants
.
###
The
money
spent
on
scrubbers
is
diverted
from
planned
research
on
new
,
cleaner
technology
.
###
The
bill
also
imposes
the
California
auto-emissions
standards
on
all
cars
nationwide
,
as
if
a
car
registered
in
Big
Sky
,
Montana
,
needed
to
be
as
clean
as
one
driven
in
Los
Angeles
.
###
Proponents
of
the
nationwide
standards
say
the
cost
for
car
buyers
would
be
about
$
500
per
car
.
###
Other
analysts
say
that
estimate
is
low
.
###
Nobody
knows
how
many
billions
of
dollars
the
Americans
With
Disabilities
Act
will
cost
,
because
nobody
knows
what
the
bill
entails
.
###
It
is
an
intentionally
vague
document
that
will
create
a
wave
of
litigation
.
###
Judges
will
write
the
real
bill
as
suits
roll
through
the
courts
.
###
Lawyers
will
benefit
.
###
Private
companies
,
and
ultimately
their
customers
,
will
end
up
footing
the
huge
bill
.
###
The
effect
of
Nixon
era
non-duck
ducks
was
an
economy
clogged
up
with
regulations
and
distortions
.
###
All
this
was
recognized
and
documented
in
the
succeeding
years
by
economists
,
some
of
whom
worked
in
the
Reagan
administration
to
lift
this
burden
from
the
American
people
,
states
and
local
governments
.
###
Running
for
President
in
1980
and
1988
,
George
Bush
also
persuasively
diagnosed
the
economic
stagnation
of
the
1970s
.
###
In
fact
,
during
last
year
's
campaign
,
the
entire
nation
constantly
heard
Mr.
Bush
tout
his
accomplishments
as
head
of
the
Task
Force
on
Regulatory
Relief
.
###
``
Government
continues
to
inhibit
the
productivity
of
our
citizenry
and
the
international
competitiveness
of
American
business
,
''
the
vice
president
declared
when
he
was
head
of
the
task
force
.
###
But
with
the
impending
passage
of
these
new
programs
,
Mr.
Bush
will
surely
be
sending
many
people
hurtling
back
into
the
regulatory
thicket
that
he
had
helped
cut
back
.
###
By
1986
,
the
number
of
federal
regulators
was
down
to
about
103,000
.
###
Then
it
turned
up
,
and
by
one
estimate
the
number
will
be
up
to
about
109,000
regulators
by
next
year
.
###
Holding
the
dam
on
taxes
is
the
most
important
task
of
the
Bush
presidency
.
###
We
would
have
thought
by
now
,
though
,
that
there
was
a
significant
core
of
people
involved
in
government
life
who
understood
that
direct
taxation
is
n't
the
only
way
to
slow
down
an
economy
.
###
It
is
merely
the
most
obvious
.
###
What
is
even
more
ironic
is
that
all
over
the
world
nations
are
learning
that
well-intentioned
public
programs
often
backfire
.
###
But
while
they
are
unloading
these
burdens
,
the
United
States
is
close
to
creating
three
more
big
ones
.
###
The
Bush
administration
ought
to
be
setting
aside
some
of
its
buckshot
for
the
non-duck
ducks
.
###
Confidence
in
the
pound
is
widely
expected
to
take
another
sharp
dive
if
trade
figures
for
September
,
due
for
release
tomorrow
,
fail
to
show
a
substantial
improvement
from
July
and
August
's
near-record
deficits
.
###
Chancellor
of
the
Exchequer
Nigel
Lawson
's
restated
commitment
to
a
firm
monetary
policy
has
helped
to
prevent
a
freefall
in
sterling
over
the
past
week
.
###
But
analysts
reckon
underlying
support
for
sterling
has
been
eroded
by
the
chancellor
's
failure
to
announce
any
new
policy
measures
in
his
Mansion
House
speech
last
Thursday
.
###
This
has
increased
the
risk
of
the
government
being
forced
to
increase
base
rates
to
16
%
from
their
current
15
%
level
to
defend
the
pound
,
economists
and
foreign
exchange
market
analysts
say
.
###
``
The
risks
for
sterling
of
a
bad
trade
figure
are
very
heavily
on
the
down
side
,
''
said
Chris
Dillow
,
senior
U.K.
economist
at
Nomura
Research
Institute
.
###
``
If
there
is
another
bad
trade
number
,
there
could
be
an
awful
lot
of
pressure
,
''
noted
Simon
Briscoe
,
U.K.
economist
for
Midland
Montagu
,
a
unit
of
Midland
Bank
PLC
.
###
Forecasts
for
the
trade
figures
range
widely
,
but
few
economists
expect
the
data
to
show
a
very
marked
improvement
from
the
#
2
billion
-LRB-
$
3.2
billion
-RRB-
deficit
in
the
current
account
reported
for
August
.
###
The
August
deficit
and
the
#
2.2
billion
gap
registered
in
July
are
topped
only
by
the
#
2.3
billion
deficit
of
October
1988
.
###
Sanjay
Joshi
,
European
economist
at
Baring
Brothers
&
Co.
,
said
there
is
no
sign
that
Britain
's
manufacturing
industry
is
transforming
itself
to
boost
exports
.
###
At
the
same
time
,
he
remains
fairly
pessimistic
about
the
outlook
for
imports
,
given
continued
high
consumer
and
capital
goods
inflows
.
###
He
reckons
the
current
account
deficit
will
narrow
to
only
#
1.8
billion
in
September
.
###
However
,
Mr.
Dillow
said
he
believes
that
a
reduction
in
raw
material
stockbuilding
by
industry
could
lead
to
a
sharp
drop
in
imports
.
###
Combined
with
at
least
some
rebound
in
exports
after
August
's
unexpected
decline
,
the
deficit
could
narrow
to
as
little
as
#
1.3
billion
.
###
Mr.
Briscoe
,
who
also
forecasts
a
#
1.3
billion
current
account
gap
,
warns
that
even
if
the
trade
figures
are
bullish
for
sterling
,
the
currency
wo
n't
advance
much
because
investors
will
want
to
see
further
evidence
of
the
turnaround
before
adjusting
positions
.
###
Nevertheless
,
he
noted
,
``
No
one
will
want
to
go
into
the
trade
figures
without
a
flat
position
''
in
the
pound
.
###
Meanwhile
,
overall
evidence
on
the
economy
remains
fairly
clouded
.
###
In
his
Mansion
House
speech
,
Mr.
Lawson
warned
that
a
further
slowdown
can
be
expected
as
the
impact
of
the
last
rise
in
interest
rates
earlier
this
month
takes
effect
.
###
U.K.
base
rates
are
at
their
highest
level
in
eight
years
.
###
But
consumer
expenditure
data
released
Friday
do
n't
suggest
that
the
U.K.
economy
is
slowing
that
quickly
.
###
The
figures
show
that
spending
rose
0.1
%
in
the
third
quarter
from
the
second
quarter
and
was
up
3.8
%
from
a
year
ago
.
###
This
compares
with
a
1.6
%
rise
in
the
second
from
the
first
quarter
and
a
5.4
%
increase
from
the
second
quarter
of
1988
.
###
Mr.
Dillow
said
the
data
show
the
economy
``
is
still
quite
strong
,
''
but
suggestions
that
much
of
the
spending
went
on
services
rather
than
consumer
goods
should
reduce
fears
of
more
import
rises
.
###
Certainly
,
the
chancellor
has
made
it
clear
that
he
is
prepared
to
increase
interest
rates
again
if
necessary
to
both
ensure
that
a
substantial
slowdown
does
take
place
and
that
sterling
does
n't
decline
further
.
###
Thursday
,
he
reminded
his
audience
that
the
government
``
can
not
allow
the
necessary
rigor
of
monetary
policy
to
be
undermined
by
exchange
rate
weakness
.
''
###
Analysts
agree
there
is
little
holding
sterling
firm
at
the
moment
other
than
Mr.
Lawson
's
promise
that
rates
will
be
pushed
higher
if
necessary
.
###
And
,
they
warn
,
any
further
drop
in
the
government
's
popularity
could
swiftly
make
this
promise
sound
hollow
.
###
Sterling
was
already
showing
some
signs
of
a
lack
of
confidence
in
Mr.
Lawson
's
promise
Friday
.
###
In
European
trading
it
declined
to
$
1.5890
and
2.9495
marks
from
$
1.5940
and
2.9429
marks
late
Thursday
.
###
Economists
suggested
that
if
the
pound
falls
much
below
2.90
marks
,
the
government
will
be
forced
to
increase
rates
to
16
%
,
both
to
halt
any
further
decline
and
ensure
that
the
balance
of
monetary
policy
remains
unchanged
.

Freight
rates
,
declining
for
most
of
the
decade
because
of
competition
spurred
by
deregulation
,
are
bottoming
out
,
turning
upward
and
threatening
to
fuel
inflation
.
###
Trucking
,
shipping
and
air-freight
companies
have
announced
rate
increases
,
scheduled
for
this
fall
or
early
next
year
,
reflecting
higher
costs
and
tightened
demand
for
freight
transport
.
###
Major
shippers
say
they
expect
freight
rates
to
rise
at
least
as
fast
as
inflation
and
maybe
faster
in
the
next
few
years
.
###
That
's
a
big
change
from
recent
years
when
freight
haulage
was
a
bright
spot
for
U.S.
productivity
,
helping
to
restrain
inflation
and
make
U.S.
industry
more
competitive
abroad
.
###
``
Demand
has
caught
up
with
the
supply
of
certain
types
of
freight
transportation
,
and
rates
are
starting
to
move
up
''
at
a
rate
``
close
to
or
slightly
more
than
the
inflation
rate
,
''
said
Clifford
Sayre
,
director
of
logistics
at
Du
Pont
Co
.
###
Shippers
surveyed
recently
by
Ohio
State
University
said
they
expect
their
freight-transport
,
storage
and
distribution
costs
to
rise
about
4
%
this
year
.
###
Only
10
%
of
the
250
shippers
polled
expected
their
freight-transport
costs
to
decrease
,
compared
with
30
%
who
had
looked
to
freight
transport
to
reduce
costs
in
past
years
.
###
``
This
is
the
first
year
since
transportation
deregulation
in
1980
that
we
have
had
such
a
dramatic
and
broad-based
upturn
in
perceived
transportation
rates
,
''
said
Bernard
LaLonde
,
a
transportation
logistics
professor
at
Ohio
State
in
Columbus
.
###
The
deregulation
of
railroads
and
trucking
companies
that
began
in
1980
enabled
shippers
to
bargain
for
transportation
.
###
Carriers
could
use
their
equipment
more
efficiently
,
leading
to
overcapacity
they
were
eager
to
fill
.
###
Shippers
cut
about
$
35
billion
from
their
annual
,
inter-city
truck
and
rail
costs
,
to
about
$
150
billion
,
or
about
6.4
%
of
gross
national
product
,
down
from
8
%
of
GNP
in
1981
.
###
But
with
much
of
the
inefficiency
squeezed
out
of
the
freight-transport
system
,
rising
costs
are
likely
to
be
reflected
directly
in
higher
freight
rates
.
###
``
Shippers
are
saying
`
the
party
's
over
,
'
''
said
Mr.
LaLonde
.
###
``
Shippers
wo
n't
be
able
to
look
for
transportation-cost
savings
as
they
have
for
the
last
eight
or
nine
years
.
###
Transport
rates
wo
n't
be
an
opportunity
for
offsetting
cost
increases
in
other
segments
of
the
economy
.
''
###
Robert
Delaney
,
a
consultant
at
Arthur
D.
Little
Inc.
,
Cambridge
,
Mass.
,
said
``
We
've
gotten
all
the
benefits
of
deregulation
in
freight-cost
reductions
.
###
Now
we
are
starting
to
see
real
freight-rate
increases
as
carriers
replace
equipment
,
pay
higher
fuel
costs
and
pay
more
for
labor
.
###
You
'll
see
carriers
try
to
recoup
some
of
the
price
cutting
that
occurred
previously
.
''
###
Not
everyone
believes
that
the
good
times
are
over
for
shippers
.
###
``
There
's
still
a
lot
of
pressure
on
rates
in
both
rail
and
truck
,
''
said
Gerard
McCullough
,
lecturer
in
transportation
at
Massachusetts
Institute
of
Technology
.
###
Less-than-truckload
companies
,
which
carry
the
freight
of
several
shippers
in
each
truck
trailer
,
discounted
away
a
4.7
%
rate
increase
implemented
last
April
.
###
The
carriers
were
competing
fiercely
for
market
share
.
###
Railroad-rate
increases
are
likely
to
be
restrained
by
weakening
rail-traffic
levels
and
keen
competition
for
freight
from
trucks
.
###
An
official
at
Consolidated
Freightways
Inc.
,
a
Menlo
Park
,
Calif.
,
less-than-truckload
carrier
,
said
rate
discounting
in
that
industry
has
begun
to
``
stabilize
.
''
###
Consolidated
Freightways
plans
to
raise
its
rates
5.3
%
late
this
year
or
early
next
year
,
and
at
least
two
competitors
have
announced
similar
increases
.
###
Truckers
are
``
trying
to
send
signals
that
they
need
to
stop
the
bloodletting
,
forget
about
market
share
and
go
for
higher
rates
,
''
said
Michael
Lloyd
,
an
analyst
at
Salomon
Bros
.
###
And
``
shippers
are
getting
the
feeling
that
they
have
played
one
trucker
off
against
another
as
much
as
they
can
,
''
he
said
.
###
Air-freight
carriers
raised
their
rates
for
U.S.
products
going
across
the
Pacific
to
Asia
by
about
20
%
earlier
this
month
.
###
And
Japan
Air
Lines
said
it
plans
to
boost
its
rates
a
further
25
%
over
the
next
two
years
.
###
Such
rate
increases
``
will
increase
the
total
cost
of
U.S.
products
and
slow
down
the
rate
of
increase
of
U.S.
exports
,
''
said
Richard
Connors
,
a
senior
vice
president
of
Yusen
Air

Sea
Service

Inc.

U.S.

.
###
Ship
companies
carrying
bulk
commodities
,
such
as
oil
,
grain
,
coal
and
iron
ore
,
have
been
able
to
increase
their
rates
in
the
last
couple
of
years
.
###
Some
bulk
shipping
rates
have
increased
``
3
%
to
4
%
in
the
past
few
months
,
''
said
Salomon
's
Mr.
Lloyd
.
###
And
ship
lines
carrying
containers
are
also
trying
to
raise
their
rates
.
###
Carriers
boosted
rates
more
than
10
%
in
the
North
Atlantic
between
the
U.S.
and
Europe
last
September
,
hoping
to
partly
restore
rates
to
earlier
levels
.
###
Ship
lines
operating
in
the
Pacific
plan
to
raise
rates
on
containers
carrying
U.S.
exports
to
Asia
about
10
%
,
effective
next
April
.
###
MGM

it
filed

statement

million
common

###
The
Beverly

said
it

###
Bob
Stone
stewed
over
a
letter
from
his
manager
putting
him
on
probation
for
insubordination
.
###
Mr.
Stone
thought
the
discipline
was
unfair
;
he
believed
that
his
manager
wanted
to
get
rid
of
him
for
personal
reasons
.
###
Unable
to
persuade
the
manager
to
change
his
decision
,
he
went
to
a
``
company
court
''
for
a
hearing
.
###
At
the
scheduled
time
,
Mr.
Stone
entered
a
conference
room
in
a
building
near
where
he
worked
.
###
After
the
three
members
of
the
court
introduced
themselves
,
the
chairman
of
the
panel
said
:
``
Go
ahead
and
tell
us
what
happened
.
###
We
may
ask
questions
as
you
go
along
,
or
we
may
wait
until
the
end
.
''
###
No
lawyers
or
tape
recorders
were
present
.
###
The
only
extra
people
were
a
couple
of
personnel
specialists
,
one
of
whom
knew
Mr.
Stone
's
case
intimately
and
would
help
fill
in
any
facts
needed
to
give
the
court
the
full
picture
.
###
Over
a
cup
of
coffee
,
Mr.
Stone
told
his
story
.
###
He
talked
about
20
minutes
.
###
When
he
was
through
,
the
court
members
asked
many
questions
,
then
the
chairman
said
they
would
like
to
hear
his
manager
's
side
and
talk
to
witnesses
.
###
The
chairman
promised
Mr.
Stone
a
decision
within
two
weeks
.
###
Bob
Stone
is
a
fictional
name
,
but
the
incident
described
is
real
.
###
It
happened
at
Northrop
Corp.
in
Los
Angeles
.
###
The
court
is
called
the
Management
Appeals
Committee
,
or
just
``
MAC
,
''
and
it
is
likely
to
hear
a
couple
of
dozen
cases
a
year
.
###
Alter
some
details
of
this
example
and
it
could
be
taking
place
today
at
Federal
Express
in
Memphis
,
the
Defense
and
Underseas
Systems
divisions
of
Honeywell
in
Minneapolis
,
a
General
Electric
plant
in
Columbia
,
Md.
,
or
a
number
of
other
companies
.
###
These
firms
are
pioneers
in
a
significant
new
trend
in
the
corporate
world
:
the
rise
of
what
I
call
corporate
due
process
.
###
Although
corporate
due
process
is
practiced
today
in
few
companies
--
perhaps
40
to
60
--
it
is
one
of
the
fastest
developing
trends
in
industry
.
###
In
the
coming
decade
a
majority
of
people-oriented
companies
are
likely
to
adopt
it
.
###
Corporate
due
process
appeals
to
management
for
a
variety
of
reasons
.
###
It
reduces
lawsuits
from
disgruntled
employees
and
ex-employees
,
with
all
that
means
for
reduced
legal
costs
and
better
public
relations
.
###
It
helps
to
keep
out
unions
.
###
It
increases
employee
commitment
to
the
company
,
with
all
that
means
for
efficiency
and
quality
control
.
###
What
must
your
management
team
do
to
establish
corporate
due
process
?
###
Here
are
four
key
steps
:
###
1
.
Make
sure
you
have
a
strong
personnel
department
.
###
It
must
be
able
to
handle
most
of
the
complaints
that
can
not
be
solved
in
the
trenches
by
managers
and
their
subordinates
,
else
the
company
court
or
adjudicators
will
be
inundated
with
cases
.
###
At
Polaroid
,
the
Personnel
Policy
Planning
Committee
may
hear
only
about
20
cases
a
year
;
the
rest
of
the
many
hundreds
of
complaints
are
resolved
at
earlier
stages
.
###
At
TWA
,
the
System
Board
of
Adjustment
hears
50
to
75
cases
a
year
,
only
a
fraction
of
the
complaints
brought
to
personnel
specialists
.
###
At
Citicorp
,
the
Problem
Review
Board
may
hear
only
12
or
so
cases
because
of
personnel
's
skill
in
complaint-resolution
.
###
In
a
typical
year
,
up
to
20
%
of
the
work
force
goes
to
personnel
specialists
with
complaints
of
unfair
treatment
.
###
In
a
large
company
that
means
many
hundreds
of
complaints
for
personnel
to
handle
.
###
2
.
Formally
or
informally
,
train
all
your
managers
and
supervisors
in
the
company
's
due-process
approach
.
###
See
that
they
know
company
personnel
policy
backwards
and
forwards
,
for
it
is
the
``
law
''
governing
company
courts
and
adjudicators
.
###
Coach
them
in
handling
complaints
so
that
they
can
resolve
problems
immediately
.
###
In
case
managers
and
personnel
specialists
are
unsuccessful
and
subordinates
take
their
complaints
to
a
company
court
or
adjudicator
,
teach
managers
to
accept
reversals
as
a
fact
of
business
life
,
for
in
a
good
due-process
system
they
are
bound
to
happen
.
###
In
the
15
companies
I
studied
,
reversal
rates
range
on
the
average
from
20
%
to
40
%
.
###
3
.
Decide
whether
you
want
a
panel
system
or
a
single
adjudicator
.
###
A
panel
system
like
that
in
the
Bob
Stone
example
enjoys
such
advantages
as
high
credibility
and
,
for
the
panelists
,
mutual
support
.
###
An
adjudicator
system
--
that
is
,
an
investigator
who
acts
first
as
a
fact-finder
and
then
switches
hats
and
arbitrates
the
facts
--
has
such
advantages
as
speed
,
flexibility
and
maximum
privacy
.
###
International
Business
Machines
and
Bank
of
America
are
among
the
companies
using
the
single-adjudicator
approach
.
###
4
.
Make
your
due-process
system
visible
.
###
It
wo
n't
do
any
good
for
anybody
unless
employees
know
about
it
.
###
Most
managements
hesitate
to
go
all
out
in
advertising
their
due-process
systems
for
fear
of
encouraging
cranks
and
chronic
soreheads
to
file
complaints
.
###
On
the
other
hand
,
they
make
sure
at
a
minimum
that
their
systems
are
described
in
their
employee
handbooks
and
talked
up
by
personnel
specialists
.
###
Smith-Kline
Beecham
goes
further
and
sometimes
features
its
grievance
procedure

programs

###
Naturally
,
one
of
the
best
ways
to
guarantee
visibility
for
your
due-process
system
is
for
top
management
to
support
it
.

But
further
major

foreseen
this

figure
in

,
traders
said
.
###

.
###
Housings

###
London
share
prices
were
influenced
largely
by
declines
on
Wall
Street
and
weakness
in
the
British
pound
.
###
The
key
Financial
Times-Stock
Exchange
100-share
index
ended
10.2
points
lower
at
2179.1
,
above
its
intraday
low
of
2176.9
,
but
off
the
day
's
high
of
2189
.
###
The
index
finished
2.4
%
under
its
close
of
2233.9
the
previous
Friday
,
although
it
recouped
some
of
the
sharp
losses
staged
early
last
week
on
the
back
of
Wall
Street
's
fall
.
###
London
was
weak
throughout
Friday
's
trading
,
however
,
on
what
dealers
attributed
to
generally
thin
interest
ahead
of
the
weekend
and
this
week
's
potentially
important
U.K.
trade
figures
for

.
###
The
FT-SE

largely
remained
within
an
11-point
range
establshed
within
the
first
hour
of
trading
before
it
eased
to
an
intraday
low
late
in
the
session
when
a
flurry
of
program
selling
pushed
Wall

lower
.
###
The
FT
30-share

closed
11.0
points
lower
at

.
###
Volume
was
extremely
thin
at
351.3
million
shares
,
the
lightest
volume
of
the
week
and
modestly
under
Thursday
's
387.4
million
shares
.
###
Dealers
said
the
day
's
action
was
featureless
outside
some
response
to
sterling
's
early
weakness
against
the
mark
,
and
fears
that
Wall
Street
might
open
lower
after
its
strong
leap
forward
Thursday
.
###
They
added
that
market-makers
were
largely
sidelined
after
aggressively
supporting
the
market
Thursday
in
their
quest
to
cover
internal
shortages
of
FT-SE
100
shares
.
###
Interest
may
remain
limited
into
tomorrow
's
U.K.
trade
figures
,
which
the
market
will
be
watching
closely
to
see
if
there
is
any
improvement
after
disappointing
numbers
in
the
previous
two
months
.
###
The
key
corporate
news
of
the
day
was
that
British
Airways
decided
to
withdraw
from
a
management-led
bid
for
UAL
Corp.
,
the
parent
of
United
Airlines
.
###
British
Airways
rose
initially
after
announcing
its
withdrawal
from
the
UAL
deal
.
###
Dealers
said
they
viewed
the
initial

390-million
-LRB-
$
622
million
-RRB-
outlay
for
a
15
%
stake
in
the
airline
as
a
bit
much
.
###
Its
shares
slid
in
late
dealings
to
close
a
penny

lower
at

The

was
the
most
active

The
next
most

top-tier
stock
was

###
The
company
gained
shareholder
approval
Thursday
to
restructure
in
a
bid
to
fend
off
the
hostile
takeover
.
###
Sir
James
said
Thursday
night
that
his
plans
for
the
takeover
had
n't
changed
.
###
B.A.T
ended
the

at

,
down

,
on

of

###
To
make
them
directly
comparable
,
each
index
is
based
on
the
close
of
1969
equaling
100
.
###
The
percentage
change
is
since
year-end
.
###
The
U.S.
is
required
to
notify
foreign
dictators
if
it
knows
of
coup
plans
likely
to
endanger
their
lives
,
government
officials
said
.
###
The
notification
policy
was
part
of
a
set
of
guidelines
on
handling
coups
outlined
in
a
secret
1988
exchange
of
letters
between
the
Reagan
administration
and
the
Senate
Intelligence
Committee
.
###
The
existence
of
the
guidelines
has
become
known
since
President
Bush
disclosed
them
privately
to
seven
Republican
senators
at
a
White
House
meeting
last
Monday
.
###
Officials
familiar
with
the
meeting
said
Mr.
Bush
cited
the
policy
as
an
example
of
the
sort
of
congressional
requirements
the
administration
contends
contribute
to
the
failure
of
such
covert
actions
as
this
month
's
futile
effort
to
oust
Panamanian
dictator
Manuel
Noriega
.
###
According
to
the
officials
,
Mr.
Bush
even
read
to
the
senators
selections
from
a
highly
classified
letter
from
the
committee
to
the
White
House
discussing
the
guidelines
.
###
They
said
the
president
conceded
the
notification
requirement
did
n't
affect
his
decision
to
lend
only
minor
support
to
this
month
's
Panama
coup
effort
.
###
No
notification
was
ever
considered
,
officials
said
,
apparently
because
the
U.S.
did
n't
think
the
coup
plotters
intended
to
kill
Mr.
Noriega
,
but
merely
sought
to
imprison
him
.
###
What
's
more
,
both
administration
and
congressional
officials
hint
that
the
notification
requirement
is
likely
to
be
dropped
from
the
guidelines
on
coup
attempts
that
are
being
rewritten
by
the
panel
and
the
White
House
.
###
The
rewriting
was
launched
at
a
meeting
between
Mr.
Bush
and
intelligence
committee
leaders
Oct.
12
,
a
few
days
before
the
meeting
at
which
the
president
complained
about
the
rules
.
###
However
,
the
disclosure
of
the
guidelines
,
first
reported
last
night
by
NBC
News
,
is
already
being
interpreted
on
Capitol
Hill
as
an
unfair
effort
to
pressure
Congress
.
###
It
has
reopened
the
bitter
wrangling
between
the
White
House
and
Congress
over
who
is
responsible
for
the
failure
to
oust
Mr.
Noriega
and
,
more
broadly
,
for
difficulties
in
carrying
out
covert
activities
abroad
.
###
A
statement
issued
by
the
office
of
the
committee
chairman
,
Sen.
David
Boren
-LRB-
D.
,
Okla.
-RRB-
,
charged
that
the
disclosure
is
part
of
a
continuing
effort
to
shift
the
criticism
for
the
failure
of
the
recent
coup
attempt
in
Panama
.
###
The
statement
added
,
``
Someone
has
regrettably
chosen
to
selectively
summarize
portions
of
highly
classified
correspondence
between
the
two
branches
of
government
.
###
Not
only
does
this
come
close
to
a
violation
of
law
,
it
violates
the
trust
we
have
all
worked
to
develop
.
''
###
Sen.
Boren
said
,
``
It
's
time
to
stop
bickering
and
work
together
to
develop
a
clear
and
appropriate
policy
to
help
the
country
in
the
future
.
###
I
've
invited
the
president
to
send
his
suggestions
to
the
committee
.
''
###
Republican
Sen.
William
Cohen
of
Maine
,
the
panel
's
vice
chairman
,
said
of
the
disclosure
that
``
a
text
torn
out
of
context
is
a
pretext
,
and
it
is
unfair
for
those
in
the
White
House
who
are
leaking
to
present
the
evidence
in
a
selective
fashion
.
''
###
Sen.
Boren
said
the
committee
could
n't
defend
itself
by
making
the
documents
public
because
that
would
violate
classification
rules
.
###
But
the
chairman
and
other
committee
members
stressed
that
the
notification
guideline
was
n't
imposed
on
the
White
House
by
a
meddling
Congress
.
###
Instead
,
both
congressional
and
administration
officials
agreed
,
it
grew
out
of
talks
about
coup-planning
in
Panama
that
were
initiated
by
the
administration
in
July
1988
and
stretched
into
last
October
.
###
The
guideline
was
n't
a
law
,
but
a
joint
interpretation
of
how
the
U.S.
might
operate
during
foreign
coups
in
light
of
the
longstanding
presidential
order
banning
a
U.S.
role
in
assassinations
.
###
In
fact
,
yesterday
the
administration
and
Congress
were
still
differing
on
what
had
been
agreed
to
.
###
One
administration
official
said
notification
was
required
even
if
the
U.S.
``
gets
wind
''
of
somebody
else
's
coup
plans
that
seem
likely
to
endanger
a
dictator
's
life
.
###
But
a
congressional
source
close
to
the
panel
said
the
rule
only
covered
coup
plans
directly
involving
the
U.S
.
###
Although
the
notification
guideline
was
n't
carried
out
in
this
month
's
coup
attempt
,
some
administration
officials
argue
that
it
may
have
led
to
hesitation
and
uncertainty
on
the
part
of
U.S.
intelligence
and
military
operatives
in
Panama
.
###
One
senior
administration
official
called
the
guideline
``
outrageous
''
and
said
it
could
make
U.S.
operatives
reluctant
to
even
listen
to
coup
plans
for
fear
they
may
get
into
legal
trouble
.
###
The
issue
came
to
a
head
last
year
,
officials
recalled
,
partly
because
the
Reagan
administration
had
sought
unsuccessfully
to
win
committee
approval
of
funding
for
new
Panama
coup
efforts
.
###
In
addition
,
both
administration
and
congressional
officials
said
the
need
for
guidelines
on
coups
and
assassinations
was
partly
spurred
by
a
White
House
desire
to
avoid
nasty
overseas
surprises
during
the
election
campaign
.
###
Though
the
assassination
ban
is
a
White
House
order
that
Congress
never
voted
on
,
the
intelligence
committees
can
exercise
influence
over
its
interpretation
.
###
Last
week
,
Central
Intelligence
Agency
Director
William
Webster
publicly
called
on
Congress
to
provide
new
interpretations
of
the
assassination
order
that
would
permit
the
U.S.
more
freedom
to
act
in
coups
.
###
The
administration
has
reacted
to
criticism
that
it
mishandled
the
latest
coup
attempt
by
seeking
to
blame
Congress
for
restrictions
the
White
House
said
have
hampered
its
freedom
of
action
.
###
However
,
last
week
Mr.
Webster
's
two
top
CIA
deputies
said
congressional
curbs
had
n't
hampered
the
spy
agency
's
role
in
the
coup
attempt
in
Panama
.
###
Nevertheless
,
the
administration
's
criticisms
appeared
to
have
made
some
headway
with
Sens.
Boren
and
Cohen
after
their
Oct.
12
meeting
with
the
president
.
###
The
three
men
agreed
to
rewrite
the
guidelines
,
without
changing
the
basic
assassination
ban
,
to
clear
up
any
ambiguities
that
may
have
hampered
U.S.
encouragement
of
coups
against
anti-American
leaders
.
###
The
new
argument
over
the
notification
guideline
,
however
,
could
sour
any
atmosphere
of
cooperation
that
existed
.

During
its
centennial
year
,
The
Wall
Street
Journal
will
report
events
of
the
past
century
that
stand
as
milestones
of
American
business
history
.
-RRB-
###
MUTUAL
FUNDS
ARRIVED
IN
THE
U.S.
during
the
Roaring
Twenties
-LRB-
they
had
been
in
Britain
for
a
century
-RRB-
,
but
they
did
n't
boom
until
the
money
market
fund
was
created
in
the
1970s
.
###
By
1980
,
there
were
more
than
100
such
funds
.
###
Besides
creating
a
vehicle
for
investors
,
money
market
funds
also
helped
rewrite
banking
regulations
.
###
The
idea
was
to
let
small
investors
,
the
backbone
of
the
fund
business
,
deal
in
the
money
market
's
high
short-term
interest
rates
.
###
This
had
been
the
exclusive
province
of
those
rich
enough
to
use
six-figure
sums
to
get
income
that
was
figured
beyond
the
third
or
fourth
decimal
place
.
###
The
now-standard
price
of
$
1
a
share
came
about
by
accident
.
###
An
early
fund
had
filed
a
registration
with
the
Securities
and
Exchange
Commission
that
included
a
fixed
$
1
price
.
###
It
arrived
just
as
the
regulator
handling
such
operations
was
retiring
.
###
His
successor
approved
the
$
1
price
in
the
process
of
clearing
the
backed-up
papers
on
his
desk
.
###
When
Dreyfus
started
the
first
advertising-backed
retail
fund
in
February
1974
,
it
was
priced
at
$
10
a
share
-LRB-
and
reached
$
1
billion
in
assets
in
one
year
.
-RRB-
###
Dreyfus
moved
to
the
$
1
price
after
the
SEC
set
standards
--
an
average
120-day
maturity
of
high-grade
paper
--
that
are
still
the
rule
.
###
Keeping
the
listed
price
at
a
dollar
is
primarily
a
convenience
.
###
Actually
,
the
funds
do
fluctuate
,
but
beyond
the
third
decimal
place
.
###
Rounding-off
keeps
them
at
$
1
.
###
Eventually
,
the
money
funds
'
success
forced
relaxation
of
curbs
on
bank
interest
rates
to
allow
banks
to
offer
competing
yields
.
###
The
new
instrument
also
introduced
many
to
the
industry
--
30
%
of
fund
owners
-LRB-
there
are
more
than
54
million
accounts
-RRB-
started
with
a
money
fund
.
###
Today
more
than
470
money
market
funds
have
total
assets
exceeding
$
350
billion
.
###
-LRB-
The
companion
tax-exempt
funds
add
$
71
billion
.
-RRB-
###
Dreyfus
alone
has
seen
its
money
market
funds
grow
from
$
1
billion
in
1975
to
closes
to
$
15
billion
today
.

,
in
which
Daimler-Benz
will
acquire

%

But
agreement
aparently
could
n't
be
reached
because
of
opposition
from
the
states

Hamburg

Bremen
,
which
are
demanding
more
influence
over
the
German

operations
and
a
better

losses
in
the
troubled
Northern
German
region
.
###
The
two
states
and
the
state
of
Bavaria
still
hold
a

their

will
fall

issues
its

on
third-quarter
real

product
this
week
in

report
that
is

to
disclose
much
tamer
inflation
.
###
The
consensus
view
on
real
GNP
,
the
total
value
of
the
nation
's
output
of
goods
and
services
adjusted
for
inflation
,
calls
for
a
2.3
%
gain
,
down
from
the
second
quarter
's
2.5
%
,
according
to
MMS
International
,
a
unit
of
McGraw-Hill
Inc.
,
New

.
###
But
inflation
,
as
measured
by
the
GNP
deflator
in
Thursday
's
report
,
is
expected
to
rise
only
3.5
%
,
down
from
4.6
%
in
the
second
quarter
.
###
``
Inflation
could
be
a
real
surprise
,
''
said
Samuel
D.
Kahan
,
chief
financial
economist
at
Kleinwort
Benson
Government
Securities
Inc.
,
in
Chicago
.
###
``
If
that
gets
people
excited
,
it
could
serve
as
an
impetus
to
the
fixed-income
markets
to
lower
their
rates
,
''
he
added
.
###
The
week
's
other
notable
indicators
include
mid-October
auto
sales
,
September
durable
goods
orders
as
well
as
September
personal
income
,
personal
consumption
and
the
saving
rate
.
###
Most
are
expected
to
fall
below
previous-month
levels
.
###
Many
economists
see
even
slower
GNP
growth
for
the
remainder
of
the
year
,
with
some
leaning
more
strongly
toward
a
possible
recession
.
###
In
addition
to
softer
production
data
,
weaker
housing
starts
and
lower
corporate
profits
currently
in
evidence
,
some
analysts
believe
the
two
recent
natural
disasters
--
Hurricane
Hugo
and
the
San
Francisco
earthquake
--
will
carry
economic
ramifications
in
the
fourth
quarter
.
###
The
recent
one-day
,
190-point
drop
in
the
Dow
Jones
Industrial
Average
seems
to
be
significant
to
economists
mainly
for
its
tacit
comment
on
the
poor
quality
of
third-quarter
profits
now
being
reported
.
###
``
The
stock
market
is
sick
because
profits
are
crumbling
,
''
says
Michael
K.
Evans
,
president
of
Evans
Economics
Inc.
,
Washington
.
###
The
economy
,
he
noted
,
moves
the
market
,
not
vice
versa
.
###
On
the
other
hand
,
Mr.
Evans
expects
the
hurricane
and
the
earthquake
``
to
take
a
hunk
out
of
fourth-quarter
GNP
.
''
###
His
estimate
of
3.3
%
for
third-quarter
GNP
is
higher
than
the
consensus
largely
because
he
believes
current
inventories
are
n't
as
low
as
official
figures
indicate
.
###
Demand
,
he
believes
,
is
being
met
from
overhang
rather
than
new
production
.
###
By
and
large
,
economists
believe
the
two
natural
catastrophes
will
limit
economic
damage
to
their
regions
.
###
Edward
J.
Campbell
,
economist
at
Brown
Brothers
Harriman
&
Co.
,
New
York
,
noted
that
large
increases
in
construction
activity
along
with
government
and
private
relief
efforts
could
offset
loss
of
production
in
those
areas
.
###
Gary
Ciminero
,
economist
at
Financial
Group
,
Providence
,
R.I.
,
expects
the
deflator
to
rise
3.7
%
,
well
below
the
second
quarter
's
4.6
%
,
partly
because
of
what
he
believes
will
be
temporarily
better
price
behavior
.
###
He
expects
real
GNP
growth
of
only
2.1
%
for
the
quarter
,
noting
a
wider
trade
deficit
,
slower
capital
and
government
spending
and
the
lower
inventory
figures
.
###
Sung
Won
Sohn
,
chief
economist
at
Norwest
Corp.
,
Minneapolis
,
holds
that
the
recent
stock-market
volatility
``
increases
the
possibility
of
economic
recession
and
reinforces
the
bad
news
''
from
recent
trade
deficit

consensus
calls
for

said
Hurrican
Hugo
shaved
0.1
%
to
0.2

because
of
greatly
diminished
rental
income

When
Rune
Andersson
set
out
to
revive
flagging
Swedish
conglomerate
Trelleborg
AB
in
the
early
1980s
,
he
spurned
the
advice
of
trendy
management
consultants
.
###
``
All
these
consultants
kept
coming
around
telling
us
we
should
concentrate
on
high
technology
,
electronics
or
biotechnology
,
and
get
out
of
mature
basic
industries
,
''
Mr.
Andersson
recalls
.
###
Yet
under
its
45-year-old
president
,
Trelleborg
moved
aggressively
into
those
unfashionable
base
industries
--
first
strengthening
its
existing
rubber
and
plastics
division
,
later
adding
mining
as
well
as
building
and
construction
materials
.
###
It
was
a
gutsy
move
for
a
little-known
executive
,
fired
after
only
two
months
as
president
of
his
previous
company
.
###
But
going
against
the
grain
has
never
bothered
Mr.
Andersson
.
###
Stroking
his
trademark
white
goatee
during
a
recent
interview
,
the
diminutive
Swede
quips
:
``
It
turned
out
to
be
lucky
for
us
.
###
If
the
whole
market
thinks
what
you
're
doing
is
crazy
you
do
n't
have
much
competition
.
''
###
Mr.
Andersson
is
anxious
to
strengthen
Trelleborg
's
balance
sheet
.
###
Characteristically
,
he
did
n't
waste
much
time
getting
started
.
###
On
Tuesday
,
Trelleborg
's
directors
announced
plans
to
spin
off
two
big
divisions
--
minerals
processing
,
and
building
and
distribution
--
as
separately
quoted
companies
on
Stockholm
's
Stock
Exchange
.
###
At
current
market
prices
,
the
twin
public
offerings
to
be
completed
next
year
would
add
an
estimated
2.5
billion
Swedish
kronor
-LRB-
$
386
million
-RRB-
to
Trelleborg
's
coffers
,
analysts
say
.
###
The
board
had
also
been
expected
to
approve
a
SKr1.5
billion
international
offering
of
new
Trelleborg
shares
.
###
But
that
share
issue
--
intended
to
make
Trelleborg
better
known
among
international
investors
--
was
postponed
until
market
conditions
stabilize
,
people
familiar
with
the
situation
say
.
###
Trelleborg
's
internationally
traded
``
Bfree
''
series
stock
plunged
SKr29
-LRB-
$
4.48
-RRB-
to
SKr205
-LRB-
$
31.65
-RRB-
in
volatile
trading
Monday
in
Stockholm
.
###
Tuesday
,
the
shares
regained
SKr20
,
closing
at
SKr225
.
###
Mr.
Andersson
says
he
is
confident
that
taking
parts
of
the
company
public
will
help
erase
the
``
conglomerate
stigma
''
that
has
held
down
Trelleborg
's
share
price
.
###
Trelleborg
plans
to
remain
the
dominant
shareholder
with
stakes
of
slightly
less
than
50
%
of
both
units
.
###
The
spinoff
should
solve
a
problem
for
the
parent
.
###
A
family
foundation
set
up
by
late
founder
Henry
Dunker
controls
59
%
of
Trelleborg
's
voting
shares
outstanding
.
###
But
the
foundation
bylaws
require
the
entire
Trelleborg
stake
to
be
sold
in
the
open
market
if
control
drops
below
50
%
.
###
That
possibility
had
crept
closer
as
repeated
new
share
offerings
to
finance
Trelleborg
's
rapid
growth
steadily
diluted
the
foundation
's
holding
.
###
That
growth
is
the
result
of
Mr.
Andersson
's
shopping
spree
,
during
which
he
has
bought
and
sold
more
than
100
companies
during
the
past
five
years
.
###
Most
of
the
new
additions
were
barely
profitable
,
if
not
outright
loss
makers
.
###
Applying
prowess
gained
during
earlier
stints
at
appliance
maker
AB
Electrolux
,
Mr.
Andersson
and
a
handful
of
loyal
lieutenants
aggressively
stripped
away
dead
wood
--
and
got
quick
results
.
###
The
treatment
turned
Trelleborg
into
one
of
Scandinavia
's
biggest
and
fastest-growing
industrial
concerns
.
###
Between
1985
and
1988
,
sales
multipled
more
than
10
times
and
pretax
profit
surged
almost
twelvefold
.
###
Many
analysts
expect
Mr.
Andersson
,
who
owns
1.7
%
of
the
company
,
to
be
named
Trelleborg
's
new
chairman
when
Ernst
Herslow
steps
down
next
year
.
###
But
the
promotion
is
n't
likely
to
alter
a
management
style
Mr.
Andersson
describes
as
``
being
the
driving
force
leading
the
troops
,
not
managing
by
sitting
back
with
a
cigar
waiting
for
people
to
bring
me
ideas
.
''
###
Last
month
,
in
his
boldest
move
yet
,
Mr.
Andersson
and
Trelleborg
joined
forces
with
Canada
's
Noranda
Inc.
in
a
joint
$
2
billion
hostile
takeover
of
another
big
Canadian
mining
concern
,
Falconbridge
Ltd
.
###
Industry
analysts
suggest
that
the
conquest
of
Falconbridge
could
vault
Trelleborg
from
a
regional
Scandinavian
success
story
to
a
world-class
mining
concern
.
###
``
Trelleborg
is
n't
in
the
same
league
yet
as
mining
giants
such
as
RTZ
Corp.
or
Anglo-American
Corp.
,
''
says
Mike
Kurtanjek
,
a
mining
analyst
at
James
Capel
&
Co.
,
London
.
###
``
But
we
certainly
like
what
we
've
seen
so
far
.
''
###
But
Trelleborg
still
must
clear
some
tough
hurdles
.
###
Mr.
Andersson
acknowledges
that
the
company
's
mining
division
``
will
be
busy
for
a
while
digesting
its
recent
expansion
.
''
###
Booming
metals
prices
have
fueled
Trelleborg
's
recent
profit
surge
,
raising
mining
's
share
of
pretax
profit
to
68
%
this
year
from
a
big
loss
two
years
earlier
.
###
But
analysts
caution
an
expected
fall
in
metal
prices
next
year
could
slow
profit
growth
.
###
Mining
is
likely
to
remain
Trelleborg
's
main
business
.
###
Analysts
say
its
chances
of
success
will
likely
hinge
on
how
well
Trelleborg
manages
to
cooperate
with
Noranda
in
the
Falconbridge
venture
.
###
Noranda
and
Trelleborg
each
came
close
to
winning
Falconbridge
alone
before
the
successful
joint
bid
.
###
Some
analysts
say
Noranda
would
prefer
to
break
up
Falconbridge
,
and
that
the
Swedes
--
relatively
inexperienced
in
international
mining
operations
--
could
have
problems
holding
their
own
with
a
much
bigger
partner
like
Noranda
operating
on
its
home
turf
.
###
Mr.
Andersson
insists
that
Trelleborg
and
Noranda
have
n't
discussed
a
Falconbridge
break-up
.
###
Falconbridge
,
he
says
,
will
continue
operating
in
its
current
form
.
###
``
We
'd
be
reluctant
to
accept
50-50
ownership
in
a
manufacturing
company
.
###
But
such
partnerships
are
common
in
mining
,
where
there
are
n't
problems
or
conflict
of
interest
or
risk
of
cheating
by
a
partner
,
''
Trelleborg
's
president
says
.
###
Perhaps
more
important
,
both
companies
share
Mr.
Andersson
's
belief
in
the
coming
renaissance
of
base
industries
.
###
``
If
the
1980s
were
a
decade
of
consumption
,
the
'90s
will
be
the
investment
decade
,
''
Mr.
Andersson
says
.
###
``
The
whole
of
Europe
and
the
industrialized
world
is
suffering
from
a
breakdown
in
infrastructure
investment
,
''
he
says
.
###
``
That
's
beginning
to
change
.
###
And
investment
is
the
key
word
for
base
metals
,
and
most
other
businesses
Trelleborg
is
in
.

prospective
investors
gathered
in
the
board
room
of
the
Philippine
government
's
Asset
Privatization
Trust
for
the
sale
of
a
36
%
interest
in
the
country
's
largest
paper
mill
.
###
The
agency
expects
the
bids
to
be
equivalent
of
more
than
$
80
million
.
###
Not
a
peso
is
offered
.
###
Mr.
Bince
,
the
trust
's
associate
executive
trustee
,
declares
the
bidding
a
failure
.
###
``
It
's
getting
harder
to
sell
,
''
he
mutters
as
he
leaves
the
room
.
###
Indeed
.
Recently
,
the
trust
failed
to
auction
off
the
paper
mill
,
a
bank
,
an
office
building
and
a
small
cotton-ginning
plant
.
###
Of
the
four
,
only
the
bank
and
the
plant
drew
bids
--
one
apiece
.
###
In
October
1987
,
President
Corazon
Aquino
vowed
that
her
government
would
``
get
out
of
business
''
by
selling
all
or
part
of
the
state
's
holdings
in
the
many
companies
taken
over
by
the
government
during
the
20-year
rule
of
Ferdinand
Marcos
.
###
Two
years
later
,
Mrs.
Aquino
's
promise
remains
largely
unfulfilled
.
###
October
is
a
critical
month
for
the
privatization
program
.
###
Manila
is
offering
several
major
assets
for
the
first
time
and
is
trying
to
conclude
sales
already
arranged
.
###
In
addition
,
the
government
is
scheduled
to
unveil
plans
for
privatizing
Philippine
Airlines
,
the
national
carrier
,
an
effort
that
lawyer
and
business
columnist
Rodolfo
Romero
calls
``
the
bellwether
of
privatization
.
''
###
All
told
,
there
are
assets
on
the
line
valued
at
up
to
$
1.03
billion
.
###
The
privatization
program
is
designed
to
rid
the
government
of
hundreds
of
assets
and
to
raise
critically
needed
funds
.
###
Much
of
the
money
from
the
sales
is
earmarked
for
a
multibillion-dollar
agrarian-reform
program
.
###
But
efforts
have
been
thwarted
by
official
indifference
,
bureaucratic
resistance
,
a
legal
system
that
operates
at
a
snail
's
pace
,
political
opposition
and
government
misjudgments
.
###
Most
recently
,
a
lack
of
buyers
has
been
added
to
the
list
.
###
Rather
than
gathering
momentum
,
the
program
is
in
danger
of
slowing
even
more
as
the
government
tackles
several
big
assets
.
###
The
axiom
appears
to
be
that
the
more
valuable
the
asset
,
the
harder
the
privatization
process
.
###
``
You
just
do
n't
see
a
whole
lot
happening
,
''
says
an
international
economist
.
###
To
be
sure
,
the
program
has
n't
completely
stalled
.
###
The
Asset
Privatization
Trust
,
the
agency
chiefly
responsible
for
selling
government-held
properties
,
has
recorded
sales
of
more
than
$
500
million
since
it
began
functioning
in
December
1986
.
###
But
its
success
has
been
largely
in
the
sale
of
small
,
nonperforming
companies
,
which
are
valued
for
their
assets
.
###
Dealing
with
the
sales
this
month
could
be
particularly
challenging
because
almost
every
problem
that
has
hobbled
the
program
in
the
past
is
popping
up
again
.
###
Ramon
Garcia
,
the
Asset
Trust
's
executive
trustee
,
admits
to
what
he
calls
``
temporary
setbacks
.
''
###
In
light
of
the
poor
results
recently
,
he
says
,
the
agency
is
adopting
an
``
attitude
of
flexibility
.
''
###
October
's
troubles
began
when
the
trust
failed
to
sell
a
state-owned
commercial
bank
,
Associated
Bank
,
for
the
minimum
price
of
671
million
pesos
-LRB-
$
31
million
-RRB-
.
###
At
the
end
of
the
month
,
the
agency
again
will
offer
the
bank
.
###
But
instead
of
a
minimum
price
,
only
a
target
price
will
be
established
.
###
Bankers
say
,
however
,
that
the
government
may
have
difficulty
selling
the
institution
even
without
a
floor
price
.
###
The
bank
has
a
negative
net
worth
,
they
say
.
###
In
addition
,
special
bidding
rules
give
the
bank
's
former
owner
,
Leonardo
Ty
,
the
right
to
match
the
highest
bid
.
###
Mr.
Ty
lost
control
to
the
government
in
1980
when
a
government
bank
made
emergency
loans
to
the
cash-strapped
institution
.
###
In
1983
,
the
loans
were
converted
into
equity
,
giving
Manila
98
%
of
the
bank
,
but
with
the
understanding
that
Mr.
Ty
had
repurchase
rights
.
###
His
ability
to
match
any
bid
has
scared
off
many
potential
buyers
.
###
Separately
,
the
government
will
try
again
within
a
month
to
sell
the
36
%
stake
in
Paper
Industries
Corp.
of
the
Philippines
,
or
Picop
,
as
the
paper
mill
is
known
.
###
The
price
will
depend
on
how
much
Picop
shares
fetch
on
the
local
stock
market
.
###
But
according
to
bankers
and
stock
analysts
who
have
studied
the
paper
mill
,
price
is
n't
the
only
consideration
.
###
As
it
stands
now
,
the
government
would
continue
to
hold
45
%
of
Picop
after
the
36
%
stake
is
sold
.
###
-LRB-
About
7.5
%
of
Picop
is
publicly
traded
and
other
shareholders
own
the
rest
of
the
equity
.
-RRB-
###
Potential
buyers
,
mostly
foreign
companies
,
are
reluctant
to
take
a
non-controlling
stake
in
a
company
that
,
by
the
government
's
own
reckoning
,
needs
some
$
100
million
in
new
capital
for
rehabilitation
.
###
The
prospect
of
buying
into
a
cash-hungry
company
without
getting
management
control
persuaded
at
least
three
foreign
buyers
,
including
a
member
of
the
Elders
group
of
Australia
,
to
pull
out
of
the
bidding
,
the
bankers
and
analysts
say
.
###
Mr.
Garcia
acknowledges
the
problem
and
says
the
Asset
Trust
will
study
why
the
bidding
failed
and
what
changes
the
agency
may
be
able
to
offer
.
###
Under
government
regulations
,
however
,
foreign
ownership
of
Picop
's
equity
is
limited
to
40
%
.
###
Even
though
the
government
would
retain
the
45
%
stake
in
Picop
,
critics
have
accused
the
trust
of
selling
out
to
foreigners
.
###
A
series
of
newspaper
articles
accused
the
trust
of
short-changing
the
government
over
the
Picop
sale
.
###
Mr.
Garcia
says
he
has
been
notified
of
congressional
hearings
on
the
Picop
bidding
and
possible
legislation
covering
the
paper
mill
's
sale
,
both
prompted
by
the
criticism
of
the
agency
.
###
The
question
of
control
could
further
hinder
long-delayed
plans
for
the
government
to
divest
itself
of
Philippine
Airlines
,
in
which
it
has
a
99
%
stake
.
###
The
carrier
has
valuable
trans-Pacific
and
Asian
routes
but
it
remains
debt-laden
and
poorly
managed
.
###
This
maker
of
electronic
measuring
devices
named
two
new
directors
,
increasing
board
membership
to
nine
.
###
The
new
directors
are

Guillermo
Ortiz
's
Sept.
15
Americas
column
,
``
Mexico
's
Been
Bitten
by
the
Privatization
Bug
,
''
is
a
refreshingly
clear
statement
of
his
government
's
commitment
to
privatization
,
and
must
be
welcomed
as
such
by
all
Americans
who
wish
his
country
well
.
###
The
Mexico-United
States
Institute
is
glad
to
see
such
a
high
official
as
Mexico
's
undersecretary
of
finance
view
his
country
's
reforms
``
in
the
context
of
a
larger
,
world-wide
process
''
of
profound
change
toward
free-market
economics
,
especially
in
the
statist
countries
.
###
Having
said
that
,
we
must
caution
against
an
apparent
tendency
to
overstate
the
case
.
###
It
is
not
quite
true
,
for
example
,
that
the
Mexican
government
has
``
privatized
''
Mexicana
de
Aviacion
,
as
Mr.
Ortiz
claims
.
###
In
the
same
sentence
he
contradicts
himself
when
he
reports
that
the
government
still
retains
40
%
of
the
total
equity
of
the
airline
.
###
How
can
a
company
be
considered
``
privatized
''
if
the
state
is
so
heavily
represented
in
it
?
###
-LRB-
True
,
the
Mexican
government
has
granted
``
control
''
over
the
airline
to
a
new
private
consortium
,
but
its
propensity
to
take
back
what
it
gives
is
too
well
known
to
permit
one
to
be
sanguine
.
-RRB-
###
Regrettably
,
too
,
Mr.
Ortiz
resorts
to
the
familiar
``
numbers
game
''
when
he
boasts
that
``
fewer
than
392
-LCB-
state
enterprises
-RCB-
currently
remain
in
the
public
sector
,
''
down
from
the
``
1,155
public
entities
that
existed
in
1982
.
###
''
But
the
enterprises
still
in
state
hands
include
the
biggest
and
most
economically
powerful
ones
in
Mexico
;
indeed
,
they
virtually
constitute
the
economic
infrastructure
.
###
I
refer
essentially
to
petroleum
,
electric
power
,
banking
and
newsprint
.
###
Those
enterprises
,
however
,
are
not
going
to
be
privatized
.
###
They
are
officially
considered
``
strategic
,
''
and
their
privatization
is
prohibited
by
the
Mexican
Constitution
.
###
In
language
that
sidesteps
the
issue
,
Mr.
Ortiz
writes
,
``
The
divestiture
of
nonpriority
and
nonstrategic
public
enterprises
is
an
essential
element
of
President
Carlos
Salinas
's
plan
to
modernize
Mexico
's
economy
.
.
.
.
''
###
Yet
clearly
,
modernization
must
embrace
its
key
industries
before
it
can
be
said
to
have
caught
the
``
privatization
bug
.
''
###
The
bottom
line
,
however
,
is
not
economic
but
political
reform
.
###
A
long
succession
of
Mexican
presidents
arbitrarily
nationalized
whatever
industry
they
took
a
fancy
to
,
without
having
to
answer
to
the
public
.
###
To
guarantee
that
Mexicana
de
Aviacion
and
other
companies
will
really
be
privatized
,
Mexico
needs
a
pluri-party
political
system
that
will
ensure
democracy
and
hence
accountability
.
###
Daniel
James
President
Mexico-United
States
Institute
###
The
board
of
this
Ponce
,
Puerto
Rico
concern
voted
to
suspend
payment
of
its
quarterly
of
11
cents
a
share
for
the
third
quarter
.
###
The
third-largest
thrift
institution
in
Puerto
Rico
also
said
it
expects
a
return
to
profitability
in
the
third
quarter
when
it
reports
operating
results
this
week
.
###
Ponce
Federal
said
the
dividend
was
suspended
in
anticipation
of
more
stringent
capital
requirements
under
the
Financial
Institutions
Reform
,
Recovery
,
and
Enforcement
Act
of
1989
.
###
A
labor-management
group
is
preparing
a
revised
buy-out
bid
for
United
Airlines
parent
UAL
Corp.
that
would
transfer
majority
ownership
to
employees
while
leaving
some
stock
in
public
hands
,
according
to
people
familiar
with
the
group
.
###
The
group
has
been
discussing
a
proposal
valued
in
a
range
of
$
225
to
$
240
a
share
,
or
$
5.09
billion
to
$
5.42
billion
.
###
But
to
avoid
the
risk
of
rejection
,
the
group
does
n't
plan
to
submit
the
plan
formally
at
a
UAL
board
meeting
today
.
###
Instead
,
the
group
is
raising
the
proposal
informally
to
try
to
test
the
board
's
reaction
.
###
People
familiar
with
the
company
say
the
board
is
n't
likely
to
give
quick
approval
to
any
offer
substantially
below
the
$
300-a-share
,
$
6.79
billion
buy-out
bid
that
collapsed
last
week
after
banks
would
n't
raise
needed
loans
and
after
a
key
partner
,
British
Airways
PLC
,
dropped
out
.
###
In
composite
trading
Friday
on
the
New
York
Stock
Exchange
,
UAL
closed
at
$
168.50
a
share
,
down
$
21.625
.
###
But
the
pilots
union
,
which
has
been
pushing
for
a
takeover
since
1987
,
appears
to
be
pressing
ahead
with
the
revised
bid
to
avoid
further
loss
of
momentum
even
though
it
has
n't
found
a
partner
to
replace
British
Air
.
###
Although
the
bidding
group
has
n't
had
time
to
develop
its
latest
idea
fully
or
to
discuss
it
with
banks
,
it
believes
bank
financing
could
be
obtained
.
###
After
the
collapse
of
the
last
effort
,
the
group
does
n't
plan
to
make
any
formal
proposal
without
binding
commitments
from
banks
covering
the
entire
amount
to
be
borrowed
.
###
Under
the
type
of
transaction
being
discussed
,
the
pilot-management
group
would
borrow
several
billion
dollars
from
banks
that
could
then
be
used
to
finance
a
cash
payment
to
current
holders
.
###
Those
current
holders
would
also
receive
minority
interests
in
the
new
company
.
###
For
example
,
the
group
could
offer
$
200
a
share
in
cash
plus
stock
valued
at
$
30
a
share
.
###
UAL
currently
has
22.6
million
shares
,
fully
diluted
.
###
The
new
structure
would
be
similar
to
a
recapitalization
in
which
holders
get
a
special
dividend
yet
retain
a
controlling
ownership
interest
.
###
The
difference
is
that
current
holders
would
n't
retain
majority
ownership
or
control
.
###
The
failed
takeover
would
have
given
UAL
employees
75
%
voting
control
of
the
nation
's
second-largest
airline
,
with
management
getting
10
%
control
and
British
Air
15
%
.
###
It
was
n't
clear
how
the
ownership
would
stack
up
under
the
new
plan
,
but
employees
would
keep
more
than
50
%
.
###
Management
's
total
could
be
reduced
,
and
the
public
could
get
more
than
the
15
%
control
that
had
been
earmarked
for
British
Air
.
###
One
option
the
board
is
likely
to
consider
today
is
some
sort
of
cooling-off
period
.
###
Although
the
pilots
are
expected
to
continue
to
pursue
the
bid
,
UAL
Chairman
Stephen
Wolf
may
be
asked
to
withdraw
from
the
buy-out
effort
,
at
least
temporarily
,
and
to
return
to
running
the
company
full
time
.
###
The
board
could
eventually
come
under
some
pressure
to
sell
the
company
because
its
members
can
be
ousted
by
a
majority
shareholder
vote
,
particularly
since
one-third
of
UAL
stock
is
held
by
takeover
stock
speculators
who
favor
a
sale
.
###
The
labor-management
buy-out
group
plans
to
keep
its
offer
on
the
table
in
an
apparent
attempt
to
maintain
its
bargaining
position
with
the
board
.
###
However
,
the
only
outsider
who
has
emerged
to
lead
such
a
shareholder
vote
,
Los
Angeles
investor
Marvin
Davis
,
who
triggered
the
buy-out
with
a
$
5.4
billion
bid
in
early
August
,
is
hanging
back
--
apparently
to
avoid
being
blamed
for
contributing
to
the
deal
's
collapse
.
###
Three
top
advisers
to
Mr.
Davis
visited
New
York
late
last
week
,
at
least
in
part
to
confer
with
executives
at
Citicorp
.
###
Mr.
Davis
had
paid
$
6
million
for
Citicorp
's
backing
of
his
last
bid
.
###
But
Citicorp
has
lost
some
credibility
because
it
also
led
the
unsuccessful
effort
to
gain
bank
loans
for
the
labor-management
group
.
###
On
Friday
,
British
Air
issued
a
statement
saying
it
``
does
not
intend
to
participate
in
any
new
deal
for
the
acquisition
of
UAL
in
the
foreseeable
future
.
''
###
However
,
several
people
said
that
British
Air
might
yet
rejoin
the
bidding
group
and
that
the
carrier
made
the
statement
to
answer
questions
from
British
regulators
about
how
it
plans
to
use
proceeds
of
a
securities
offering
previously
earmarked
for
the
UAL
buy-out
.
###
Also
late
last
week
,
UAL
flight
attendants
agreed
to
participate
with
the
pilots
in
crafting
a
revised
offer
.
###
But
the
machinists
union
,
whose
opposition
helped
scuttle
the
first
buy-out
bid
,
is
likely
to
favor
a
recapitalization
with
a
friendly
third-party
investor
.
###
One
advantage
the
buy-out
group
intends
to
press
with
the
board
is
that
pilots
have
agreed
to
make
$
200
million
in
annual
cost
concessions
to
help
finance
a
bid
.
###
Speculation
has
also
arisen
that
the
UAL
executive
most
closely
identified
with
the
failure
to
gain
bank
financing
,
chief
financial
officer
John
Pope
,
may
come
under
pressure
to
resign
.
###
However
,
people
familiar
with
the
buy-out
group
said
Mr.
Pope
's
departure
would
weaken
the
airline
's
management
at
a
critical
time
.
###
Despite
the
buy-out
group
's
failure
to
obtain
financing
,
UAL
remains
obligated
to
pay
$
26.7
million
in
investment
banking
and
legal
fees
to
the
group
's
advisers

Lazard
Freres

is
such
a
contradictory
figure
that
nobody
has
even
come
up
with
any
good
jokes
about
him
.
###
``
You
have
to
have
clear
feelings
about
someone
before
you
can
make
jokes
,
''
says
an
East
German
mother
of
two
who
loves
swapping
political
barbs
with
her
friends
.
###
``
With
Krenz
,
we
just
do
n't
know
what
to
expect
.
''
###
Mr.
Krenz
does
n't
seem
to
be
the
knee-jerk
hardliner
many
initially
thought
he
was
when
the
52-year-old
Politburo
member
was
selected
last
week
to
succeed
Erich
Honecker
.
###
But
he
does
n't
appear
to
be
ready
to
make
broad
changes
either
.
###
According
to
East
Germany
's
ADN
news
agency
,
Mr.
Krenz
spoke
to
Soviet
leader
Mikhail
Gorbachev
by
telephone
over
the
weekend
and
acknowledged
East
Germany
could
learn
from
Moscow
's
glasnost
policies
.
###
Already
last
week
,
Mr.
Krenz
started
overhauling
East
Germany
's
heavily
censored
and
notoriously
boring
news
media
.
###
On
Thursday
,
a
day
after
he
took
office
,
East
German
television
broke
into
regular
programming
to
launch
a
talk
show
in
which
viewers
call
in
questions
for
a
panel
of
officials
to
answer
.
###
The
regular
nightly
news
program
and
daily
newspapers
are
also
getting
a
visible
injection
of
Soviet-style
glasnost
.
###
``
It
was
quite
a
shock
,
''
says
a
43-year-old
East
German
shopkeeper
.
###
``
For
the
first
time
in
my
life
,
I
was
n't
sure
whether
I
was
listening
to
our
news
or
West
German
television
.
''
###
Other
changes
,
including
easing
restrictions
on
travel
for
East
Germans
,
are
expected
.
###
But
whether
such
moves
can
win
back
the
confidence
of
East
Germans
,
who
have
taken
to
the
streets
by
the
thousands
in
recent
weeks
to
demand
democratic
changes
,
depends
largely
on
whether
they
feel
they
can
trust
Mr.
Krenz
.
###
And
that
's
a
problem
.
###
Mr.
Krenz
is
not
only
closely
identified
with
his
mentor
,
Mr.
Honecker
,
but
also
blamed
for
ordering
violent
police
action
against
protesters
this
month
and
for
praising
China
for
sending
tanks
against
student
demonstrators
.
###
``
I
hope
he
grows
with
the
job
,
''
says
Rainer
Eppelmann
,
a
Protestant
pastor
in
East
Berlin
.
###
``
The
most
important
thing
is
that
he
have
a
chance
.
''
###
Although
Mr.
Krenz
is
dedicated
to
East
Germany
's
conservative
vein
of
communism
,
there
is
much
about
his
style
that
sets
him
apart
from
his
party
comrades
.
###
Unlike
Mr.
Honecker
,
who
tended
to
lecture
people
about
socialist
values
,
Mr.
Krenz
enjoys
asking
questions
.
###
Indeed
,
one
of
his
first
actions
as
leader
was
to
visit
a
gritty
machine
factory
on
the
outskirts
of
Berlin
and
wander
among
the
workers
--
a
la
Gorbachev
.
###
He
was
later
shown
on
television
,
fielding
questions
.
###
At
one
point
,
he
asked
a
worker
whether
he
thought
East
Germans
were
fleeing
the
country
because
of
restrictive
travel
policies
.
###
The
worker
's
tart
reply
:
``
It
's
more
than
just
travel
.
People
have
a
sense
the
government
is
ignoring
the
real
problems
in
our
society
.
''
###
The
exchange
was
all
the
more
remarkable
in
that
authorities
released
television
footage
to
Western
news
agencies
.
###
This
same
tendency
toward
openness
impressed
a
group
of
visiting
U.S.
congressmen
this
spring
.
###
Rather
than
trying
to
``
lecture
us
,
''
says
one
congressional
aide
who
attended
the
two-hour
meeting
,
Mr.
Krenz
``
wanted
to
listen
.
''
###
Rep.
Ronnie
Flippo
-LRB-
D.
,
Ala.
-RRB-
,
one
of
the
members
of
the
delegation
,
says
he
was
particularly
impressed
by
Mr.
Krenz
's
ready
admission
that
East
Germany
needed
to
change
.
###
``
He
's
a
very
tough
man
,
but
one
who
's
also
open
to
arguments
,
''
adds
an
aide
to
West
German
Chancellor
Helmut
Kohl
.
###
But
there
's
another
side
to
Mr.
Krenz
.
###
Born
in
a
Baltic
town
in
an
area
which
is
now
part
of
Poland
,
he
has
dedicated
his
life
to
the
party
apparatus
.
###
He
moved
quickly
through
the
ranks
with
the
help
of
his
patron
,
Mr.
Honecker
,
and
emerged
as
the
heir
apparent
.
###
Barbara
Donovan
,
an
expert
on
East
Germany
at
Radio
Free
Europe
in
Munich
,
says
Mr.
Krenz
may
project
a
smooth
image
,
but
she
doubts
he
's
a
true
reformer
.
###
Even
if
he
is
,
she
adds
,
he
appears
to
have
only
limited
room
for
maneuver
within
the
Communist
Party
's
ruling
Politburo
.
###
Against
this
background
,
the
new
East
German
leader
must
move
quickly
to
shore
up
his
government
's
standing
.
###
The
sudden
growth
of
the
opposition
movement
,
together
with
the
steady
outflow
of
citizens
escaping
through
Poland
and
Hungary
,
has
plunged
the
country
into
its
deepest
political
crisis
since
an
anti-Soviet
workers
'
uprising
in
1953
.
###
``
He
does
n't
have
any
honeymoon
period
,
''
says
a
Western
diplomat
based
in
East
Berlin
.
###
``
But
if
he
's
sharp
and
quick
,
he
has
a
chance
.
''
###
The
diplomat
adds
that
Mr.
Krenz
has
several
things
going
for
him
.
###
The
East
German
economy
is
strong
compared
with
other
East
bloc
nations
.
###
And
his
relative
youth
could
help
him
project
a
more
vibrant
image
,
contrasting
with
the
perception
of
Mr.
Honecker
as
an
out-of-touch
old
man
.
###
For
average
East
Germans
,
Mr.
Krenz
remains
a
puzzle
.
###
``
Either
he
was
n't
being
real
in
the
past
,
or
he
is
n't
being
real
right
now
,
''
says
a
30-year-old
East
German
doctor
.
###
``
Either
way
,
I
have
a
problem
with
how
quickly
he
's
changed
.
''
###
The
doctor
was
among
dozens
of
people
milling
through
East
Berlin
's
Gethsemane
Church
Saturday
morning
.
###
The
walls
of
the
church
are
covered
with
leaflets
,
news
clippings
,
and
handwritten
notes
associated
with
the
country
's
political
opposition
.
###
``
I
have
to
come
here
to
read
the
walls
,
''
says
the
doctor
,
``
because
it
's
information
I
still
ca
n't
get
through
the
newspapers
.
''
###
Meanwhile
,
East
Germany
's
growing
openness
may
even
allow
the
state-controlled
news
media
to
display
a
muted
sense
of
humor
.
###
Television
last
week
carried
a
new
report
on
East
Berlin
's
main
wallpaper
factory
and
the
need
to
boost
production
.
###
East
Germans
remember
a
comment
a
few
years
ago
by
Kurt
Hager
,
the
government
's
top
ideologist
,
that
just
because
a
neighbor
hangs
new
wallpaper
,
there
's
no
reason
to
change
your
own
.
###
His
point
was
there
is
no
reason
for
East
Germany
to
copy
Soviet-style
changes
.
###
``
It
's
hard
to
know
whether
it
was
intended
to
be
funny
,
''
says
the
East
Berlin
shopkeeper
,
``
But
everyone
I
know
laughed
about
it
.
###
The
list
of
laboratories
claiming
to
be
producing
inexplicable
amounts
of
heat
from
``
cold
fusion
''
experiments
is
slowly
growing
.
###
But
the
experiments
continue
to
be
plagued
by
lack
of
firm
evidence
that
the
extra
heat
is
coming
from
the
fusing
of
hydrogen
atoms
.
###
New
experiments
at
some
of
the
big
national
laboratories
are
still
unable
to
find
hints
of
nuclear
fusion
reactions
,
leaving
only
the
finding
of
tritium
in
a
Texas
experiment
to
support
University
of
Utah
chemists
'
claim
of
achieving
hydrogen
fusion
at
room
temperatures
.
###
The
latest
developments
in
cold
fusion
research
were
presented
in
24
reports
delivered
at
the
fall
meeting
here
of
the
Electrochemical
Society
,
the
first
scientific
meeting
in
five
months
to
hear
formal
reports
on
cold
fusion
experiments
.
###
The
meeting
offered
stark
evidence
of
a
dramatic
fall
in
scientific
interest
in
cold
fusion
research
.
###
Of
the
1,300
chemists
registered
for
the
society
's
weeklong
meeting
,
fewer
than
200
sat
through
the
day
and
a
half
of
cold
fusion
presentations
at
week
's
end
.
###
This
was
in
contrast
with
the
society
's
meeting
last
May
,
at
the
height
of
the
controversy
,
when
more
than
1,500
scientists
,
along
with
scores
of
reporters
and
TV
crews
,
crowded
into
a
Los
Angeles
hotel
ballroom
for
a
tumultuous
special
night
session
on
the
subject
.
###
Neither
of
the
two
chemists
whose
Utah
experiments
triggered
the
cold
fusion
uproar
,
Martin
Fleischmann
and
B.
Stanley
Pons
,
were
at
the
meeting
.
###
But
some
members
of
an
ad
hoc
expert
committee
set
up
by
the
Department
of
Energy
to
evaluate
the
cold
fusion
research
were
in
the
audience
.
###
The
committee
is
to
recommend
at
the
end
of
the
month
whether
DOE
should
support
cold
fusion
research
.
###
Most
of
the
two
dozen
scientists
taking
the
podium
reported
results
with
new
,
more
sophisticated
variations
of
the
seemingly
simple
electrolysis-of-water
experiments
described
last
March
by
Messrs.
Fleischmann
and
Pons
.
###
The
experiments
involve
encircling
a
thin
rod
of
palladium
metal
with
a
wire
of
platinum
and
plunging
the
two
electrodes
into
``
heavy
''
water
in
which
the
hydrogen
atoms
are
a
doubly
heavy
form
known
as
deuterium
.
###
When
an
electric
current
is
applied
to
the
palladium
and
platinum
electrodes
,
the
heavy
water
did
begin
to
break
up
,
or
dissociate
.
###
Ordinarily
the
electrolysis
,
or
breakup
,
of
the
water
would
consume
almost
all
of
the
electrical
energy
.
###
But
Messrs.
Fleischmann
and
Pons
said
their
experiments
also
produced
large
amounts
of
heat
.
###
The
heat
energy
plus
the
energy
consumed
by
the
breakup
of
the
water
molecules
added
to
far
more
energy
coming
out
of
the
apparatus
than
electrical
energy
going
in
,
they
reported
.
###
Because
they
also
detected
tritium
and
indications
of
nuclear
radiation
,
they
asserted
that
the
``
excess
''
heat
energy
must
be
coming
from
energy
released
by
the
nuclear
fusion
of
deuterium
atoms
inside
the
palladium
rod
.
###
As
of
last
weekend
,
a
dozen
labs
also
have
reported
measuring
``
excess
''
heat
from
similar
electrolytic
experiments
,
although
amounts
of
such
heat
vary
widely
.
###
One
of
the
seven
reports
presented
here
of
excess
heat
production
was
given
by
Richard
A.
Oriani
,
professor
of
chemical
engineering
at
the
University
of
Minnesota
.
###
Mr.
Oriani
said
his
skepticism
of
the
Utah
claims
was
initially
confirmed
when
his
first
experiments
last
spring
failed
to
produce
results
.
###
But
he
then
borrowed
a
palladium
rod
from
chemists
at
Texas
A&M
who
said
they
were
getting
excess
heat
.
###
``
The
results
were
fascinating
,
''
he
said
.
###
On
the
fourth
``
run
''
with
the
borrowed
rod
,
the
experiment
began
producing
excess
heat
.
###
The
experiment
was
stopped
briefly
to
change
an
instrument
.
###
When
it
was
restarted
,
heat
output
``
really
took
off
''
and
produced
excess
heat
for
several
hours
before
dying
down
,
he
said
.
###
Typical
of
other
experiments
,
Mr.
Oriani
said
his
experiment
was
``
very
erratic
.
''
###
It
would
go
along
doing
nothing
but
dissociating
the
heavy
water
and
then
at
totally
unpredictable
times
,
it
would
begin
producing
excess
heat
for
as
long
as
10
or
11
hours
before
quieting
down
.
###
The
excess
heat
was
15
%
to
20
%
more
than
the
energy
involved
in
the
electrolysis
of
water
.
###
Mr.
Oriani
said
the
heat
bursts
were
too
large
and
too
long
to
be
explained
by
the
sudden
release
of
energy
that
might
have
slowly
accumulated
during
the
experiments
'
quiescent
times
,
as
some
scientists
have
suggested
.
###
``
There
is
a
reality
to
the
excess
energy
,
''
he
said
.
###
Other
scientists
said
they
also
were
getting
sporadic
bursts
of
excess
heat
lasting
several
hours
at
a
time
.
###
The
bursts
often
occur
,
they
said
,
after
they
``
perturbed
''
the
experiments
by
raising
or
lowering
the
amount
of
electric
current
being
applied
,
or
switching
the
current
off
and
on
.
###
One
chemist
privately
suggested
this
hinted
that
some
``
anomalous
''
chemical
reactions
might
be
producing
the
heat
.
###
One
reason
questions
surround
the
heat
experiments
is
that
they
involve
unusually
meticulous
measurements
.
###
Typically
,
the
input
energy
ranges
from
a
third
of
a
watt
to
one
watt
and
the
excess
energy
is
measured
in
tenths
of
a
watt
.
###
One
exception
is
a
continuing
experiment
at
Stanford
University
where
as
much
as
10
watts
of
energy
are
being
put
into
the
electrolytic
cells
.
###
A
cell
filled
with
heavy
water
is
producing
1.0
to
1.5
watts
more
heat
than
an
identical
electrolytic
cell
filled
with
ordinary
water
next
to
it
,
reported
Turgut
M.
Gur
,
an
associate
of
materials
scientist
Robert
A.
Huggins
,
head
of
the
Stanford
experimental
team
.
###
One
of
the
few
hints
the
excess
heat
might
be
produced
by
fusion
came
from
brief
remarks
by
chemist
John
Bockris
of
Texas
A&M
University
.
###
Mr.
Bockris
previously
reported
getting
bursts
of
excess
heat
and
of
detecting
increasing
amounts
of
tritium
forming
in
the
heavy
water
.
###
He
said
that
within
the
past
few
days
,
he
's
gotten
evidence
that
there
is
a
``
weak
correlation
''
between
the
time
the
heat
bursts
occur
and
the
production
of
tritium
.
###
There
is
n't
any
way
to
continuously
measure
the
amount
of
tritium
in
the
heavy
water
,
so
it
's
been
difficult
to
tell
whether
the
tritium
formation
is
related
to
the
heat
bursts
or
some
other
phenomenon
.
###
Increasingly
careful
attempts
to
measure
neutrons
,
which
would
be
strong
evidence
of
fusion
reactions
,
continue
to
be
negative
.
###
Messrs.
Fleischmann
and
Pons
initially
reported
indirect
evidence
of
neutrons
being
produced
in
their
experiment
but
later
conceded
the
measurements
were
questionable
.
###
Researchers
at
Sandia
National
Laboratories
in
Albuquerque
,
N.M.
,
reported
they
went
so
far
as
to
take
a
``
cold
fusion
''
experiment
and
three
neutron
detectors
into
a
tunnel
under
300
feet
of
granite
to
shield
the
detectors
from
cosmic
rays
.
###
A
number
of
times
they
detected
neutrons
in
one
,
sometimes
two
,
of
the
three
detectors
,
but
only
once
during
411
hours
of
the
experiment
did
they
detect
a
neutron
burst
in
all
three
detectors
--
and
they
think
that
was
a
spurious
event
.
###
Shimson
Gottesfeld
of
Los
Alamos
National
Laboratory
said
researchers
there
detected
a
burst
of
neutrons
from
an
early
cold
fusion
experiment
last
April
but
decided
not
to
announce
it
until
they
could
confirm
it
.
###
In
subsequent
experiments
,
one
of
two
neutron
detectors
occasionally
indicated
a
burst
of
neutrons
but
neutron
bursts
were
never
recorded
in
both
detectors
at
the
same
time
.
###
They
concluded
the
indications
of
neutrons
stemmed
from
faults
in
the
detectors
rather
than
from
the
cold
fusion
experiment
.
###
At
the
Lawrence
Berkeley
Laboratory
in
California
,
new
experiments
indicated
that
the
lithium
added
to
the
heavy
water
so
it
will
conduct
a
current
can
produce
previously
unsuspected
electrical
effects
on
the
surface
of
the
palladium
rod
--
which
Messrs.
Fleischmann
and
Pons
might
have
misinterpreted
,
reported
Philip
Ross
from
the
California
laboratory
.

###
It
owns
67
%
of
Telerate

a

.
###
Reflecting
the
impact
of
lower
semiconductor
prices
and
cuts
in
defense
spending
,
Texas
Instruments
Inc.
said
third-quarter
net
income
fell
31
%
and
sales
dropped
slightly
from
a
year
earlier
.
###
Net
fell
to
$
65
million
,
or
67
cents
a
common
share
,
from
$
93.7
million
or
$
1.03
a
share
,
a
year
ago
.
###
Sales
fell
2.5
%
to
$
1.54
billion
from
$
1.58
billion
.
###
For
the
nine
months
,
the
electronics
and
defense
concern
had
net
of
$
255.8
million
,
or
$
2.70
a
share
,
down
5.6
%
from
$
271
million
,
or
$
3.01
a
share
,
in
the
year-ago
period
.
###
Sales
were
$
4.66
billion
,
up
1.3
%
from
$
4.6
billion
.
###
Jerry
Junkins
,
chairman
,
president
and
chief
executive
officer
,
said
sluggish
consumer-electronics
sales
reduced
demand
for
semiconductors
.
###
That
,
coupled
with
lower
semiconductor
prices
and
higher
semiconductor-depreciation
expense
,
contributed
to
the
decline
in
sales
and
profit
.
###
In
addition
,
cost
increases
related
to
fixed-price
defense
contracts
and
a
$
10
million
charge
to
reduce
the
work
force
of
Texas
Instruments
'
defense-electronics
division
also
reduced
net
.
###
However
,
the
quarter
results
included
$
28
million
in
royalty
income
from
patent
licenses
,
up
from
$
21
million
in
the
year-earlier
period
.
###
The
nine
months
include
$
125
million
of
royalty
income
,
up
from
$
98
million
last
year
.
###
Mr.
Junkins
was
n't
optimistic
about
the
short-term
outlook
,
hinting
that
further
workforce
reductions
may
be
needed
.
###
``
We
expect
near-term
sluggishness
in
the
electronics
market
,
''
he
said
,
``
and
we
will
take
ongoing
cost-reduction
actions
as
necessary
to
keep
operations
aligned
with
demand
.
''
###
Further
,
he
said
,
an
internal
reorganization
to
combine
several
divisions
into
the
Information
Technology
Group
is
expected
to
affect
fourth-quarter
results
by
an
undisclosed
amount
.
###
Lynch
Corp.
said
its
Lynch
Telephone
Corp.
subsidiary
completed
the
acquisition
of
Western
New
Mexico
Telephone
Co.
for
$
20
million
plus
assumption
of
$
24
million
of
debt
.
###
Western
New
Mexico
Telephone
,
Silver
City
,
had
net
income
of
$
1.9
million
on
revenue
of
about
$
10
million
last
year
.
###
It
is
an
independent
phone
company
with
a
service
area
of
15,000
square

.
###
It
is
also
a
partner
in
the
wireline
cellular
franchise
covering
most
of
western
New
Mexico
.
###
The
transaction
represents
Lynch
's
entry
into
the
telephone
business
.
###
The
company
,
which
has
interests
in
television
,
trucking
services
,

said
it
plans
to
make
other

in
the
telephone
industry

###
Nelson
Bunker
Hunt
on
silver
a
decade
ago
is
still
haunting
the
market
in
this
metal
.
###
Silver
,
now
trading
around
$
5
an
ounce
,
surged
to
an
all-time
peak
of
$
50
an
ounce
in
January
1980
from
around
$
9
in
mid-1979
.
###
``
Mr.
Hunt
's
attempt
to
squeeze
the
silver
market
10
years
ago
is
still
indirectly
to
blame
for
today
's
market
depression
,
''
says
Lesley
Edgar
,
managing
director
of
Sharps
Pixley
Ltd.
,
London
bullion
brokers
.
###
While
some
100
million
ounces
of
silver
once
held
by
Mr.
Hunt
and
Middle
Eastern
associates
are
n't
hanging
over
the
market
anymore
,
the
price
surge
of
1979-80
precipitated
an
expansion
of
mine
production
and
scrap
recovery
and
encouraged
silver
consumers
to
economize
on
silver
use
,
Mr.
Edgar
says
.
###
Photographic
developers
,
for
example
,
bought
equipment
to
recover
silver
from
spent
photographs
,
negatives
and
processing
solutions
.
###
Meanwhile
,
the
photographic
industry
,
which
accounts
for
44
%
of
silver
consumption
,
continues
to
look
for
substitutes
.
###
Japanese
and
U.S.
photographic
firms
are
beginning
to
produce
electronic
cameras
and
X-rays
that
do
n't
require
silver
,
dealers
say
.
###
Silver
's
history
of
volatility
is
also
discouraging
investors
,
dealers
say
.
###
Even
in
the
present
uncertain
investment
climate
,
investors
are
preferring
``
quality
assets
''
such
as
Treasury
bills
and
bonds
to
gold
,
silver
and
platinum
,
dealers
say
.
###
Although
prices
rallied
briefly
following
the
tumble
on
world
stock
markets
earlier
this
month
and
the
related
decline
of
the
dollar
,
precious
metals
are
out
of
favor
for
the
moment
because
of
high
interest
rates
and
a
determination
by
industrial
nations
to
curb
inflation
,
dealers
say
.
###
Silver
,
however
is
in
a
deeper
slump
than
are
gold
and
platinum
.
###
Some
analysts
contend
that
silver
is
cheap
now
that
prices
are
languishing
at
levels
last
seen
in
the
mid-1970s
.
###
``
Bargain
hunters
believe
that
silver
offers
the
best
value
amongst
precious
metals
,
''
says
Frederick
R.
Demler
,
analyst
at
Drexel
Burnham
Lambert
Inc
.
###
A
further
decline
in
prices
will
lead
to
mine
production
cuts
in
the
U.S.
,
he
says
.
###
Scrap
merchants
are
converting
smaller
quantities
of
metal
into
silver
,
while
low
prices
are
discouraging
exports
from
India
and
the
Soviet
Union
.
###
Silver
prices
could
also
be
boosted
by
strikes
in
leading
producing
nations
Peru
and
Mexico
,
Mr.
Demler
says
.
###
Meanwhile
,
total
fabrication
demand
for
silver
has
risen
six
years
in
a
row
,
he
says
.
###
Japanese
demand
grew
by
70
%
in
the
first
half
of
this
year
and
the
nation
plans
an
issue
of
a
silver
commemorative
coin
that
will
require
4.5
million
ounces
.
###
Compared
with
huge
annual
surpluses
of
more
than
100
million
ounces
in
the
first
half
of
the
1980s
,
world
silver
supplies
and
consumption
are
now
nearly
in
balance
,
Mr.
Demler
says
.
###
Despite
intermittent
rallies
in
the
past
few
years
,
improvements
in
the
supply-demand
balance
have
n't
managed
to
push
silver
prices
into
a
higher
range
.
###
``
There
's
just
too
much
silver
around
,
''
says
Tom
Butler
,
an
analyst
at
Samuel
Montagu
&
Co.
,
a
London
bullion
house
.
###
A
huge
silver
stockpile
at
exchanges
,
refiners
,
consuming
industries
and
government
warehouses
of
at
least
617
million
ounces
is
the
market
depressant
,
says
Shearson
Lehman
Hutton
Inc.
in
a
report
.
###
This
year
alone
,
inventories
at
the
Commodity
Exchange
of
New
York
jumped
``
by
a
staggering
46
million
to
221
million
ounces
''
because
of
producer
deliveries
,
de-stocking
by
fabricators
and
sales
by
disenchanted
investors
,
says
Rhona
O'Connell
,
London-based
precious
metals
analyst
at
Shearson
Lehman
Hutton
.
###
``
Silver
production
is
also
in
an
inexorable
upward
trend
,
''
Ms.
O'Connell
says
.
###
Moreover
,
while
Asian
and
Middle
Eastern
investors
hoard
gold
and
help
underpin
its
price
,
silver
does
n't
have
the
same
mystique
,
dealers
say
.
###
Investors
have
gotten
burned
on
silver
so
often
that
they
are
far
more
partial
to
gold
,
says
Urs
Seiler
,
senior
vice
president
at
Union
Bank
of
Switzerland
.
###
Yet
if
gold
prices
improve
,
silver
prices
could
rally
sharply
,
he
says
.
###
However
,
dealers
caution
that
any
increase
would
be
$
1
to
$
2
at
most
.
###
Looking
ahead
to
other
commodity
markets
this
week
:
Livestock
and
Meats
Analysts
expect
the
prices
of
live
cattle
futures
contracts
to
rise
in
trading
today
in
the
wake
of
a
government
quarterly
census
that
found
fewer-than-expected
cattle
on
feedlots
.
###
After
the
close
of
trading
Friday
,
the
Agriculture
Department
reported
that
feedlots
in
the
13
biggest
ranch
states
held
8.06
million
cattle
on
Oct.
1
,
down
6
%
from
that
date
a
year
earlier
.
###
Most
analysts
had
expected
the
government
to
report
a
4
%
decline
.
###
Feedlots
fatten
young
cattle
for
slaughter
,
so
a
decline
signals
a
tightening
supply
of
beef
.
###
The
government
reported
that
the
number
of
young
cattle
placed
on
feedlots
during
the
quarter
dropped
5
%
compared
with
the
year-earlier
quarter
.
###
Many
industry
analysts
had
been
projecting
a
3
%
decline
in
placements
for
the
quarter
.
###
In
the
1988
quarter
,
many
farmers
were
forced
to
sell
their
cattle
to
feedlot
operators
because
the
drought
dried
out
the
pasture
on
their
ranches
.
###
The
number
of
cattle
moving
onto
feedlots
in
the
recent
quarter
was
also
lower
because
fattening
cattle
is
less
profitable
.
###
A
shortage
of
young
cattle
has
made
them
more
expensive
for
feedlot
operators
to
buy
.
###
The
Agriculture
Department
also
said
that
the
number
of
fattened
cattle
slaughtered
in
the
quarter
dropped
by
5
%
from
the
1988
quarter
,
which
was
in
line
with
projections
by
analysts
.
###
Energy
Friday
's
44-cent-a-barrel
price
drop
to
$
19.98
in
the
expiring
November
contract
for
West
Texas
Intermediate
crude
may
well
set
the
tone
for
trading
this
week
in
petroleum
futures
on
the
New
York
Mercantile
Exchange
.
###
Most
traders
and
analysts
attributed
the
decline
to
technical
factors
associated
with
the
contract
's
going
off
the
board
.
###
Others
said
that
the
drop
continued
the
downward
correction
that
's
been
due
in
the
petroleum
pits
and
that
such
a
trend
could
well
continue
in
the
next
several
trading
sessions
.
###
Barring
any
petroleum-related
news
events
,
trading
in
the
days
ahead
should
further
test
recent
projections
by
oil
economists
and
other
market
watchers
that
strong
fourth-quarter
demand
will
keep
prices
firm
.
###
Copper
prices
fell
sharply
Friday
afternoon
.
###
For
example
,
copper
for
December
delivery
settled
4.5
cents
lower
at
$
1.2345
a
pound
.
###
Pressure
came
from
several
developments
including
the
settlement
of
two
long-term
strikes
.
###
On
Friday
,
one
analyst
said
,
rank-and-file
workers
ratified
a
new
labor
agreement
ending
a
three-month
strike
at
the
Highland
Valley
mine
in
British
Columbia
.
###
In
Mexico
,
the
analyst
added
,
employees
at
the
Cananea
mine
,
who
have
been
out
of
work
since
late
August
when
the
mine
was
declared
bankrupt
by
the
government
,
accepted
a
35
%
cut
in
the
3,800-man
work
force
.
###
The
mine
is
expected
to
return
to
production
in
about
a
week
.
###
On
Friday
,
selling
dominated
the
afternoon
``
curb
''
session
in
London
,
which
takes
place
at
noon
EDT
.
###
The
premium
of
cash
copper
to
the
three-month
forward
offerings
narrowed
,
indicating
weaker
demand
for
cash
copper
.
###
Long-term
support
for
the
December
contract
was
believed
to
be
at
$
1.25
a
pound
.
###
A
technical
analyst
said
there
were
a
number
of
stop-loss
orders
under
that
level
that
were
touched
off
when
the
contract
's
price
fell
below
it
.
###
That
brought
in
considerable
fund
selling
,
which
continued
until
the
close
of
trading
.
###
``
In
general
,
it
was
a
bearish
close
,
''
said
Ben
Hanauer
,
a
copper
trader
at
Rudolph
Wolff
&
Co.
,
a
major
commodities
trading
and
brokerage
firm
.
###
But
whether
this
price
break
has
implications
for
this
week
,
he
said
,
``
we
will
know
more
when
the
London
Metal
Exchange
copper
stock
levels
are
released
Monday
morning
.
''
###
Another
analyst
said
he
expected
LME
inventories
to
be
down
by
about
15,000
tons
when
the
weekly
report
is
issued
.
###
Bernard
Savaiko
,
senior
commodities
analyst
at
PaineWebber
Inc.
,
said
that
when
traders
saw
the
market
was
n't
reacting
positively
to
the
forecasts
of
lower
LME
stocks
,
they
perceived
a
bearish
sign
.
###
He
also
noted
that
the
Japanese
,
who
had
been
buying
at
prices
just
above
the
$
1.25
level
,
apparently
pulled
back
from
the
market
on
Friday
.
###
Mr.
Savaiko
said
he
sees
a
possibility
of
the
December
contract
dropping
to
$
1.05
a
pound
.
###
Hewlett-Packard
Co.
will
announce
today
a
software
program
that
allows
computers
in
a
network
to
speed
up
computing
tasks
by
sending
the
tasks
to
each
other
.
###
Called
Task
Broker
,
the
program
acts
something
like
an
auctioneer
among
a
group
of
computers
wired
together
.
###
If
a
machine
has
a
big
computing
task
,
Task
Broker
asks
other
computers
in
the
network
for
``
bids
''
on
the
job
.
###
It
then
determines
which
machine
is
free
to
do
the
task
most
quickly
and
sends
the
task
to
that
machine
.
###
Hewlett-Packard
claims
that
the
software
allows
a
network
to
run
three
times
as
many
tasks
as
conventional
networks
and
will
run
each
task
twice
as
fast
.
###
The
new
Hewlett-Packard
program
,
said
analyst
John
McCarthy
at
Forrester
Research
Inc.
,
a
computer-market
research
company
,
``
is
a
key
building
block
as
people
move
to
this
new
model
of
distributed
processing
.
''
###
In
today
's
computer
networks
,
some
machines
often
sit
idle
while
others
are
overtaxed
.
###
With
the
Hewlett-Packard
program
,
he
said
,
``
You
get
more
bang
for
the
buck
you
've
spent
on
computers
.
''
###
The
program
,
which
will
be
shipped
in
January
1990
,
runs
on
the
Unix
operating
system
.
###
Hewlett-Packard
will
charge
$
5,000
for
a
license
covering
10
users
.
###
The
program
now
works
on
all
Hewlett-Packard
and
Apollo

###
The
Task
Broker
differs
from
other
programs
that
spread
computing
tasks
around
a
network
.
###
A
previously
available
program
called
Network
Computing
System
,
developed
by
Hewlett-Packard
's
Apollo
division
,
for
instance
,
takes
a
task
and
splits
it
up
into
parts
,
divvying
up
those
parts
to
several
computers
in
a
network
for
simultaneous
processing
.
###
But
programs
in
individual
computers
must
be
revised
in
order
to
work
with
that
system
.
###
Applications
wo
n't
have
to
be
rewritten
to
work
with
Task
Broker
,
Hewlett-Packard
said
,
and
the
user
of
a
computer
wo
n't
be
able
to
tell
that
another
machine
is
doing
the
work
.
###
The
Task
Broker
``
turns
that
network
into
--
as
far
as
the
user
is
concerned
--
one
giant
computer

###
Price
wars
between
the
fast-food
giants
are
starting
to
clobber
the
fast-food
little
guys
:
the
franchisees
.
###
``
When
elephants
start
fighting
,
ants
get
killed
,
''
says
Murray
Riese
,
co-owner
of
National
Restaurants
,
a
New
York
franchisee
for
Pizza
Hut
,
Roy
Rogers
and
other
chains
.
###
As
hamburger
and
pizza
outlets
saturate
one
area
after
another
,
franchisers
are
struggling
desperately
for
market
share
,
slashing
prices
and
stepping
up
costly
promotions
.
###
The
fight
is
putting
a
tight
squeeze
on
profits
of
many
,
threatening
to
drive
the
smallest
ones
out
of
business
and
straining
relations
between
the
national
fast-food
chains
and
their
franchisees
.
###
The
chains
``
used
to
offer
discounts
during
winter
when
business
was
slow
,
but
in
the
last
year
or
so
,
discounting
has
become
a
12-month
thing
,
''
says
Donald
Harty
,
president
of
Charisma
Group
Inc.
,
a
New
York
franchisee
of
Grand
Metropolitan
PLC
's
Burger
King
chain
.
###
Though
Charisma
's
sales
are
up
slightly
this
year
,
Mr.
Harty
says
profits
will
be
flat
or
lower
.
###
And
Bill
Konopnicki
,
a
Safford
,
Ariz.
,
licensee
of
McDonald
's
Corp.
who
is
chairman
of
the
company
's
National
Operators
Advisory
Board
,
says
some
fast-food
outlets
``
could
be
in
serious
trouble
,
based
on
the
amount
of
discounting
that
seems
to
be
going
on
.
''
###
Until
recently
,
the
huge
fast-food
industry
,
with
sales
of
about
$
60.1
billion
last
year
,
kept
price-skirmishing
to
a
minimum
.
###
But
early
this
year
,
PepsiCo
Inc.
's
Taco
Bell
unit
and
Wendy
's
International
Inc.
slashed
prices
and
stepped
up
promotions
,
says
John
Rohs
,
an
analyst
for
Wertheim
Schroder
&
Co
.
###
That
brought
a
chain
reaction
in
the
industry
.
###
The
situation
was
further
aggravated
early
this
month
,
when
McDonald
's
set
plans
to
heat
up
the
discounting
by
offering
coupons
.
###
It
also
decided
to
go
national
with
pizza
,
which
it
has
been
test-marketing
.
###
Now
,
two-for-one
deals
on
pizza
are
common
;
so
are
99-cent
specials
on
sandwiches
normally
priced
twice
as
high
.
###
The
discounting
,
say
fast-food
operators
,
occurs
on
a
scale
and
with
a
frequency
they
have
n't
seen
before
.
###
The
result
is
that
some
franchisees
are
running
hard
just
to
stay
even
,
laying
off
middle
managers
and
working
harder
to
make
less
.
###
Joe
Mack
,
a
district
manager
for
Cormack
Enterprises
Inc.
,
a
Burger
King
operator
in
Omaha
,
Neb.
,
says
discounting
is
so
prevalent
that
``
we
have
to
serve
15
%
to
20
%
more
customers
''
to
keep
sales
level
.
###
``
It
's
almost
as
if
you
're
doing
extra
work
to
give
away
the
food
,
''
he
says
.
###
Alan
D'Agosto
,
president
of
Panda
's
Inc.
,
an
operator
of
Arby
's
restaurants
in
Omaha
,
says
:
``
All
we
're
doing
is
keeping
the
customers
coming
,
but
we
are
n't
increasing
sales
.
''
###
With
fast-food
outlets
on
every
corner
,
he
,
like
many
,
does
n't
think
he
has
a
choice
in
the
price
war
:
``
Our
customers
say
that
they
wo
n't
go
into
a
fast-food
store
unless
they
get
a
coupon
.
''
###
If
the
battle
continues
much
longer
,
many
fast-food
businesses
will
close
or
merge
,
predicts
Vincent
Morrissey
,
who
owns
a
string
of
Kentucky
Fried
Chicken
stores
in
the
Midwest
.
###
``
The
industry
is
overbuilt
,
''
he
says
.
###
``
Fast-food
franchisers
have
managed
to
squeeze
in
stores
into
every
corner
available
.
''
###
The
National
Restaurant
Association
says
quick-service
restaurant
units
in
the
U.S.
rose
14
%
to
131,146
between
1983
and
1987
,
the
last
year
for
which
figures
are
available
.
###
With
the
market
so
crowded
,
says
a
spokesman
for
Wendy
's
in
Columbus
,
Ohio
,
``
If
you
're
doing
well
,
you
're
doing
well
at
someone
else
's
expense
.
''
###
Simply
put
,
there
is
n't
enough
business
for
every
store
to
grow
.
###
According
to
Mr.
Rohs
,
inflation-adjusted
,
same-store
sales
at
company-owned
Wendy
's
units
in
the
U.S.
have
trailed
year-earlier
levels
throughout
1989
,
except
for
August
.
###
``
McDonald
's
has
also
been
running
negative
all
year
,
''
the
analyst
says
.
###
Spokesmen
for
Wendy
's
and
McDonald
's
criticized
Mr.
Rohs
's
calculations
.
###
Jack
Greenberg
,
executive
vice
president
and
chief
financial
officer
of
McDonald
's
,
says
the
company
does
n't
compute
,
much
less
disclose
,
inflation-adjusted
,
same-store
sales
.
###
He
adds
that
short-term
comparisons
``
can
be
very
misleading
because
of
differences
in
timing
of
marketing
programs
from
year
to
year
.
''
###
Profit
margins
at
company-owned
McDonald
's
outlets
in
the
U.S.
``
are
holding
up
quite
nicely
,
''
says
Mr.
Greenberg
.
###
Profits
of
franchisees
have
n't
been
higher
since
the
mid-1970s
,
he
adds
.
###
But
Mr.
Greenberg
's
sanguine
outlook
is
n't
matched
by
many
fast-food
industry
observers
.
###
Smaller
chains
and
single-store
operators
will
be
the
first
to
fail
,
many
in
the
industry
predict
.
###
Big
franchise
groups
``
can
ride
out
the
storm
a
lot
longer
,
''
says
Mr.
Harty
,
the
Burger
King
operator
in
New
York
.
###
The
prolonged
price
pressures
are
driving
a
wedge
between
some
franchisers
and
their
franchisees
.
###
Mr.
Morrissey
,
the
Kentucky
Fried
Chicken
franchisee
,
notes
that
most
franchise
owners
must
absorb
increases
in
expenses
without
any
cut
in
the
royalties
,
or
portion
of
sales
,
that
they
must
pay
franchisers
.
###
Franchisees
ca
n't
be
forced
to
go
along
with
a
franchiser
's
discounting
.
###
But
once
a
franchisee
agrees
to
a
promotional
program
,
the
franchiser
can
demand
full
participation
to
the
very
end
,
says
Lew
Rudnick
,
a
principal
of
Rudnick
&
Wolfe
,
a
Chicago
law
firm
with
franchise
industry
clients
.
###
He
says
courts
have
held
that
antitrust
considerations
are
outweighed
in
such
cases
by
the
need
to
protect
consumers
from
deceptive
marketing
.
###
In
any
case
,
many
franchisees
,
in
order
to
stay
on
good
terms
with
franchisers
,
routinely
go
along
with
promotions
.
###
Says
Mr.
Riese
of
National
Restaurants
:
``
If
you
resisted
on
prices
,
maybe
you
would
never
get
that
telephone
call
about
a
new
franchise

million
sale
of
assets
from
its
Los
Angeles
area
real
estate
portfolio
for
net
income
of
$

CalMat
said
the

is
part
of
its
previously
announced
plan
to
sell
much
of

###
And
you
thought
the
only
reason
to
save
your
canceled
checks
was
to
prepare
for
an
IRS
audit
.
###
Reggie
Jackson
,
the
retired
baseball
star
,
has
found
another
use
for
them
.
###
Mr.
Jackson
,
who
won
the
nickname
``
Mr.
October
''
for
his
World
Series
exploits
,
is
selling
some
of
his
canceled
checks
to
autograph
collectors
through
a
dealer
for
as
much
as
$
500
each
.
###
Dealers
say
the
budding
trade
in
Mr.
Jackson
's
canceled
checks
is
unusual
.
###
``
I
do
n't
know
of
any
living
ballplayer
that
's
ever
done
it
,
''
says
Jack
Smalling
,
a
dealer
in
Ames
,
Iowa
,
and
a
recognized
expert
in
the
field
of
baseball
autographs
.
###
An
initial
batch
of
Mr.
Jackson
's
checks
was
on
sale
at
a
baseball-card
show
held
in
San
Francisco
over
Labor
Day
weekend
.
###
Mr.
Jackson
showed
up
at
the
affair
to
sign
autographs
for
a
fee
as
well
.
###
``
For
someone
who
has
everything
else
--
Reggie
's
jersey
,
cap
and
cards
--
his
checks
might
be
a
nice
addition
,
''
says
William
Vizas
,
owner
of
Bill
's
Sports
Collectibles
in
Denver
,
who
examined
the
checks
at
the
San
Francisco
card
show
.
###
For
years
,
the
canceled
checks
of
a
small
number
of
well-known
baseball
players
have
been
bought
and
sold
.
###
But
these
players
were
dead
.
###
``
Maybe
three
years
ago
,
there
were
a
lot
of
-LCB-
Ty
-RCB-
Cobbs
in
the
hobby
,
and
awhile
back
there
were
Babe
Ruth
checks
,
''
says
Mr.
Smalling
.
###
However
,
the
thought
of
a
living
player
selling
his
checks
rubs
some
people
the
wrong
way
.
###
``
Maybe
I
'm
a
little
stuffy
,
but
I
would
n't
sell
them
,
''
sniffs
Bob
Machon
,
owner
of
Papa
's
Sports
Cards
in
Menlo
Park
,
Calif
.
###
``
Who
knows
how
much
they
'll
be
worth
100
years
from
now
?
''
###
And
Mr.
Smalling
does
n't
believe
they
're
worth
all
that
much
now
.
###
``
I
do
n't
think
the
checks
are
worth
$
15
apiece
,
''
he
says
.
###
Why
Mr.
Jackson
,
who
could
n't
be
reached
for
comment
,
has
made
some
of
his
checks
available
for
sale
is
n't
clear
.
###
He
probably
has
n't
done
it
for
the
cash
.
###
``
I
would
say
he
's
definitely
not
in
need
of
money
,
''
says
Matt
Merola
,
an
agent
of
Mr.
Jackson
's
based
in
New
York
.
###
``
He
has
good
investments
.
''
###
And
Mr.
Jackson
probably
has
opened
new
checking
accounts
,
too
.
###
Or
at
least
he
should
.
###
``
I
assume
those
accounts
are
closed
,
''
says
Mr.
Smalling
,
referring
to
the
accounts
of
the
canceled
checks
.
###
``
I
do
n't
think
he
'd
want
to
give
out
his
current
account
numbers
.
###
USX
Corp.
and
its
Japanese
partner
,
Kobe
Steel
Ltd.
,
agreed
to
form
a
joint
venture
to
build
a
new
plant
to
produce
hot-dipped
galvanized
sheet
products
,
mainly
for
the
automotive
market
.
###
Terms
were
n't
disclosed
for
the
plant
,
which
will
have
annual
capacity
of
600,000
tons
.
###
The
move
by
the
nation
's
largest
steelmaker
follows
a
string
of
earlier
announcements
by
other
major
steel
companies
.
###
Bethlehem
Steel
Corp.
,
LTV
Corp.
and
Armco
Inc.
all
have
plans
to
build
additional
lines
for
such
coated
corrosion-resistant
steel
.
###
The
surge
in
production
,
analysts
say
,
raises
questions
about
capacity
outpacing
demand
.
###
They
note
that
most
of
the
new
plants
will
come
on
line
in
1992
,
when
the
current
import
trade
restraint
program
ends
,
which
could
result
in
.
###
``
There
's
too
much
capacity
,
''
contended
Charles
Bradford
,
an
analyst
with
Merrill
Lynch
Capital
Markets
.
###
``
I
do
n't
think
there
's
anyone
not
building
one
.
''
###
He
does
add
,
however
,
that
transplanted
Japanese
car
makers
are
boosting
the
levels
of
U.S.-made
steel
in
their
autos
,
instead
of
relying
heavily
on
imported
steel
.
###
That
trend
could
increase
demand
for
hot-dipped
galvanized
sheet
.
###
The
hot-dipped
galvanized
segment
is
one
of
the
fastest-growing
and
most
profitable
segments
of
the
steel
market
,
coveted
by
all
major
integrated
steelmakers
wanting
to
maintain
an
edge
over
smaller
minimills
and
reconstructed
mills
--
those
spun
off
to
employees
.
###
Indeed
,
USX
said
it
expects
the
market
for
coated
sheet
steel
to
reach
12
million
tons
annually
by
1992
,
compared
with
10.2
million
tons
shipped
in
1988
.
###
For
the
first
eight
months
of
1989
,
analysts
say
shipments
of
hot-dipped
galvanized
steel
increased
about
8
%
from
a
year
earlier
,
while
overall
steel
shipments
were
up
only
2.4
%
.
###
USX
and
Kobe
Steel
hope
to
reach
a
definitive
agreement
establishing
the
50-50
partnership
by
the
end
of
the
year
,
with
construction
tentatively
slated
for
the
spring
of
1990
and
production
by
1992
.
###
USX
already
has
six
lines
in
existing
plants
producing
hot-dipped
galvanized
steel
,
but
this
marks
the
first
so-called
greenfield
plant
for
such
production
.
###
Moreover
,
it
will
boost
by
50
%
USX
's
current
hot-dipped
capacity
of
1,275,000
tons
.
###
The
company
said
it
does
n't
expect
the
new
line
's
capacity
to
adversely
affect
the
company
's
existing
hot-dipped
galvanizing
lines
.
###
Steelmakers
have
also
been
adding
capacity
of
so-called
electrogalvanized
steel
,
which
is
another
way
to
make
coated
corrosion-resistant
steel
.
###
One
of
the
advantages
of
the
hot-dipped
process
is
that
it
allows
the
steel
to
be
covered
with
a
thicker
coat
of
zinc
more
quickly
.
###
ONCE
YOU
MAKE
UP
your
mind
about
an
investment
,
the
rest
is
easy
,
right
?
###
You
just
call
your
broker
and
say
``
buy
''
or
``
sell
.
''
###
Dream
on
.
###
There
are
all
sorts
of
ways
to
give
buy
and
sell
instructions
to
a
broker
--
and
just
as
many
ways
to
get
burned
if
you
do
n't
know
what
you
're
doing
.
###
So
here
's
a
rundown
of
the
most
common
types
of
market
orders
permitted
by
the
stock
and
commodity
exchanges
.
###
Two
things
to
keep
in
mind
:
Not
all
exchanges
accept
every
type
of
order
.
###
And
even
when
a
specific
order
is
acceptable
to
an
exchange
,
a
brokerage
firm
can
refuse
to
enter
it
for
a
customer
.
###
Market
Order
:
This
is
probably
the
most
widely
used
order
--
and
the
one
most
open
to
abuse
by
unscrupulous
floor
brokers
,
since
it
imposes
no
price
restrictions
.
###
With
a
market
order
,
an
investor
tells
a
broker
to
buy
or
sell
``
at
the
market
.
''
###
It
's
like
saying
,
``
get
me
in
now
''
or
``
get
me
out
now
.
''
###
For
example
,
if
wheat
is
being
offered
at
$
4.065
and
bid
at
$
4.060
,
a
market
order
to
buy
would
be
filled
at
the
higher
price
and
a
market
order
to
sell
at
the
lower
price
.
###
A
recent
indictment
alleges
that
some
floor
brokers
at
the
two
largest
Chicago
commodity
exchanges
used
market
orders
to
fill
customers
'
orders
at
unfavorable
prices
by
arranging
trades
with
fellow
brokers
.
###
Profits
realized
from
these
trades
would
then
be
shared
by
the
conspiring
brokers
.
###
Limit
Order
:
Limit
orders
are
used
when
investors
want
to
restrict
the
amount
they
will
receive
or
pay
for
an
investment
.
###
Investors
do
this
by
specifying
a
minimum
price
at
which
the
investment
may
be
sold
or
the
maximum
price
that
may
be
paid
for
it
.
###
Suppose
an
investor
wants
to
sell
a
stock
,
but
not
for
less
than
$
55
.
###
A
limit
order
to
sell
could
be
entered
at
that
price
.
###
One
risk
:
Investors
may
regret
the
restriction
if
the
stock
reaches
54
and
then
falls
.
###
Unless
the
market
goes
at
least
one
tick
-LRB-
the
smallest
price
increment
permitted
-RRB-
beyond
the
limit
price
,
investors
are
n't
assured
of
having
their
orders
filled
because
there
may
not
be
sufficient
trading
volume
to
permit
filling
it
at
the
specified
price
.
###
Stop
Order
:
Stop
orders
tell
a
floor
broker
to
buy
or
sell
an
investment
once
the
price
reaches
a
certain
level
.
###
Once
the
price
reaches
that
level
,
a
stop
order
turns
into
a
market
order
,
and
the
order
is
filled
at
whatever
price
the
broker
can
get
.
###
Stop
orders
are
sometimes
called
``
stop-loss
''
orders
because
they
are
frequently
used
to
protect
profits
or
limit
losses
.
###
While
stop
orders
sound
similar
to
limit
orders
,
there
is
a
difference
:
Sell
stops
must
be
entered
at
a
price
below
the
current
market
price
and
buy
stops
above
.
###
In
contrast
,
sell
limit
orders
must
be
placed
above
the
market
price
and
buy
limit
orders
are
placed
below
.
###
The
crash
in
October
1987
and
last
Friday
's
sell-off
painfully
taught
some
investors
exactly
what
stop
orders
will
and
wo
n't
do
.
###
An
investor
who
may
have
placed
a
stop-loss
order
at
$
90
under
a
stock
that
was
trading
at
$
100
a
share
on
the
Friday
before
the
crash
was
stunned
to
discover
that
the
order
was
filled
at
$
75
when
the
stock
opened
at
that
price
on
Monday
.
###
Stop-Limit
Order
:
Stop-limit
orders
turn
into
limit
orders
when
an
investment
trades
at
the
price
specified
in
the
order
.
###
Unlike
stop
orders
--
which
are
filled
at
the
market
price
when
the
stop
price
is
hit
--
stop-limit
orders
demand
that
the
trades
be
made
only
at
the
specified
price
.
###
If
it
ca
n't
be
made
at
that
price
,
it
does
n't
get
filled
.
###
Investors
who
wish
to
be
out
of
a
position
,
without
the
risk
of
receiving
a
worse-than-expected
price
from
a
market
order
,
may
use
this
type
of
order
to
specify
the
price
at
which
the
order
must
be
filled
.
###
But
if
the
market
moves
quickly
enough
,
it
may
be
impossible
for
the
broker
to
carry
out
the
order
because
the
investment
has
passed
the
specified
price
.
###
Market-If-Touched
Order
:
Market-if-touched
orders
are
like
stop
orders
in
that
they
become
market
orders
if
a
specified
price
is
reached
.
###
However
,
unlike
a
buy-stop
order
,
a
buy
market-if-touched
order
is
entered
at
a
price
below
the
current
price
,
while
a
sell
market-if-touched
order
is
entered
at
a
price
above
it
.
###
As
soon
as
the
market
trades
at
the
specified
price
the
floor
broker
will
fill
it
at
the
best
possible
price
.
###
Fill-Or-Kill
Order
:
The
fill-or-kill
order
is
one
of
several
associated
with
the
timing
of
trades
.
###
It
instructs
a
broker
to
buy
or
sell
an
investment
at
the
specified
price
or
better
.
###
But
if
the
investment
ca
n't
be
bought
or
sold
immediately
,
the
order
is
automatically
canceled
.
###
Gregory
Bessemer
,
who
came
in
second
in
the
stock
division
of
the
recently
completed
U.S.
Trading
Championship
,
says
he
uses
fill-or-kill
orders
almost
exclusively
when
trading
options
.
###
``
I
like
to
use
them
to
feel
out
the
market
,
''
he
says
.
###
``
If
they
do
n't
fill
it
immediately
,
then
I
can
start
over
at
a
new
price
or
try
again
with
the
same
price
.
''
###
Not-Held
Order
:
This
is
another
timing
order
.
###
It
is
a
market
order
that
allows
floor
brokers
to
take
more
time
to
buy
or
sell
an
investment
,
if
they
think
they
can
get
a
better
price
by
waiting
.
###
Not-held
orders
,
which
are
also
known
as
``
disregard
the
tape
''
orders
,
are
always
done
at
the
customer
's
risk
.
###
One-Cancels-The-Other
Order
:
This
is
really
two
orders
in
one
,
generally
for
the
same
security
or
commodity
,
instructing
floor
brokers
to
fill
whichever
order
they
can
first
and
then
cancel
the
other
order
.
###
In
a
fast-moving
market
,
it
prevents
an
investor
from
getting
stuck
with
having
made
two
trades
on
the
same
security
.
###
Specific-Time
Order
:
This
type
of
order
couples
many
of
the
orders
described
above
with
instructions
that
the
order
must
be
carried
out
at
or
by
a
certain
time
.
###
``
On
the
close
''
can
be
added
to
many
types
of
orders
.
###
For
example
,
``
market-on-close
orders
''
must
be
filled
during
the
last
few
minutes
of
trading
for
the
day
at
a
price
that
is
within
the
official
closing
range
of
prices
as
determined
by
the
exchange
.
###
``
Stop-close-only
orders
''
are
stop
orders
that
only
become
active
during
the
closing
minutes
of
trading
.
###
``
Day
orders
''
expire
at
the
end
of
the
day
on
which
they
are
entered
,
``
good-till-canceled
orders
''
have
no
expiration
date
.
###
Most
brokers
assume
that
all
orders
are
day
orders
unless
specified
otherwise
.
###
On
Oct.
19
,
1987
,
some
investors
learned
the
consequences
of
entering
``
good-til-canceled
limit
orders
''
and
then
forgetting
about
them
.
###
They
found
they
had
bought
stock
from
limit
orders
that
they
might
have
entered
weeks
or
months
earlier
and
had
forgotten
to
cancel
.
###
It
is
always
the
responsibility
of
investors
to
keep
track
of
the
orders
they
have
placed
.
###
Investors
who
change
their
mind
about
buying
or
selling
after
an
order
has
been
filled
are
,
usually
,
stuck
with
the
consequences
.
###
Mr.
Angrist
writes
on
the
options
and
commodities
markets
for
The
Wall
Street
Journal
.
###
IN
SIZING
UP
the
risks
of
stock-market
investments
,
there
's
probably
no
starting
place
better
than
``
beta
.
''
###
But
investors
better
not
ignore
its
limitations
,
either
.
###
Beta
is
a
handy
gauge
that
measures
the
volatility
of
a
stock
or
stock
mutual
fund
.
###
For
any
given
move
in
the
overall
market
,
it
suggests
how
steeply
that
particular
issue
might
rise
or
fall
.
###
Beta
figures
are
widely
available
and
easy
to
interpret
.
###
The
beta
of
the
broad
market
,
typically
defined
as
the
Standard
&
Poor
's
500-stock
index
,
is
always
1.0
.
###
So
a
stock
with
a
beta
of
0.5
is
half
as
volatile
,
one
at
1.5
is
50
%
more
volatile
,
and
so
on
.
###
Cautious
investors
should
generally
go
with
stocks
that
have
low
betas
.
###
Go
with
high-beta
stocks
to
get
the
biggest
payoff
from
a
bet
on
a
bull
market
.
###
Remember
,
though
,
that
beta
also
has
important
limitations
.
###
``
Beta
is
only
part
of
the
risk
in
a
stock
,
''
says
William
F.
Sharpe
,
the
Stanford
University
emeritus
professor
who
developed
the
measure
.
###
``
There
is
risk
that
is
not
associated
with
market
moves
,
and
the
beta
does
n't
tell
you
the
magnitude
of
that
.
''
###
In
particular
,
beta
does
n't
measure
the
company
-
and
industry-specific
risk
associated
with
an
individual
stock
.
###
That
``
business
''
risk
is
very
significant
for
an
investor
with
only
a
few
stocks
,
but
it
virtually
disappears
in
a
large
and
well-diversified
portfolio
.
###
Beta
is
also
a
poor
indicator
of
the
risk
in
stock
groups
that
march
to
their
own
drummer
.
###
In
particular
,
the
prices
of
gold
and
other
precious-metals
stocks
shoot
up
and
down
,
but
the
stocks
tend
to
have
low
betas
because
their
moves
are
not
market-inspired
.
###
Concern
that
investors
could
misinterpret
such
readings
led
the
American
Association
of
Individual
Investors
to
eliminate
beta
figures
for
precious-metals
funds
in
the
1989
edition
of
its
mutual-fund
guide
.
###
``
Our
fear
was
people
would
look
just
at
the
beta
-LCB-
of
a
gold
fund
-RCB-
and
say
here
is
an
investment
with
very
low
risk
,
''
says
John
Markese
,
director
of
research
for
the
Chicago-based
group
.
###
``
In
reality
it
's
very
volatile
,
but
the
movements
are
not
because
of
market
movements
.
###
READY
TO
REVIEW
the
riskiness
of
your
investment
portfolio
?
###
First
,
a
pop
quiz
.
###
When
you
think
of
the
words
``
risk
''
and
``
investment
,
''
what
's
the
specific
peril
that
comes
to
mind
?
###
Pencils
down
.
###
If
you
're
like
most
people
,
you
said
it
's
a
holding
that
goes
completely
sour
--
maybe
a
bond
that
defaults
or
a
stock
whose
value
disappears
in
a
bankruptcy
proceeding
.
###
``
People
tend
to
see
risk
primarily
on
that
one
dimension
,
''
says
Timothy
Kochis
,
national
director
of
personal
financial
planning
for
accountants
Deloitte
,
Haskins
&
Sells
.
###
But
therein
lies
another
aspect
of
investment
risk
:
the
hazard
of
shaping
your
portfolio
to
avoid
one
or
more
types
of
risk
and
being
blind-sided
by
others
.
###
This
is
clearly
not
good
news
to
all
you
people
who
sleep
like
babies
every
night
,
lulled
by
visions
of
your
money
sitting
risk-free
in
six-month
CDs
.
###
Risk
wears
many
disguises
,
and
investments
that
are
low
in
one
type
of
obvious
risk
can
be
distressingly
high
in
other
,
less
obvious
kinds
.
###
U.S.
Treasury
bonds
,
for
example
,
are
supersafe
when
it
comes
to
returning
money
at
maturity
.
###
But
their
value
as
investments
can
be
decimated
by
inflation
,
which
erodes
the
purchasing
power
of
bonds
'
fixed-dollar
interest
payments
.
###
Risk
is
also
a
function
of
time
.
###
When
financial
professionals
measure
risk
mathematically
,
they
usually
focus
on
the
volatility
of
short-term
returns
.
###
Stocks
are
much
riskier
than
Treasury
bills
,
for
example
,
because
the
range
in
performance
from
the
best
years
to
the
worst
is
much
wider
.
###
That
is
usually
measured
by
the
standard
deviation
,
or
divergence
,
of
annual
results
from
the
average
return
over
time
.
###
But
investors
who
are
preoccupied
with
short-term
fluctuations
may
be
paying
too
little
attention
to
another
big
risk
--
not
generating
enough
money
to
meet
long-term
financial
and
life-style
goals
.
###
For
instance
,
some
investors
have
sworn
off
stocks
since
the
1987
market
crash
;
last
Friday
's
debacle
only
reinforced
those
feelings
.
###
But
the
stock
market
,
despite
some
stomach-churning
declines
,
has
far
outperformed
other
securities
over
extended
periods
.
###
By
retreating
to
the
apparent
security
of
,
say
,
money-market
funds
,
investors
may
not
be
earning
enough
investment
return
to
pay
for
a
comfortable
retirement
.
###
``
That
's
the
biggest
risk
of
all
--
the
risk
of
not
meeting
your
objectives
,
''
says
Steven
B.
Enright
,
a
New
York
financial
planner
with
Seidman
Financial
Services
.
###
As
a
result
,
financial
advisers
say
they
take
several
steps
when
evaluating
the
riskiness
of
clients
'
portfolios
.
###
They
estimate
the
return
a
person
's
current
portfolio
is
likely
to
generate
over
time
,
along
with
a
standard
deviation
that
suggests
how
much
the
return
will
vary
year
by
year
.
###
They
try
to
figure
out
the
long-term
results
the
person
needs
to
meet
major
goals
.
###
And
they
eyeball
types
of
risk
that
are
not
easily
quantified
.
###
The
portfolios
of
two
hypothetical
families
,
one
a
couple
at
retirement
age
and
another
a
two-income
couple
at
age
45
,
illustrate
several
types
of
risk
that
investors
need
to
consider
.
###
For
instance
,
the
insured
municipal
bonds
that
dominate
the
older
couple
's
portfolio
were
probably
selected
in
large
part
for
their
low
repayment
risk
.
###
But
they
expose
the
holders
to
a
lot
of
inflation
risk
and
interest-rate
risk
.
###
The
younger
couple
's
stockholdings
involve
more
risk
than
a
diversified
stock
portfolio
because
the
bulk
of
the
money
is
in
a
single
issue
.
###
Note
that
the
younger
couple
's
portfolio
has
a
higher
expected
annual
return
,
10.1
%
vs.
8.8
%
,
as
calculated
by
Seidman
Financial
Services
,
which
is
the
financial-planning
affiliate
of
BDO
Seidman
.
###
That
largely
reflects
the
heavy
stockholdings
.
###
But
one
price
paid
for
the
higher
expected
return
is
greater
short-term
volatility
,
as
reflected
in
the
higher
standard
deviation
that
Seidman
estimates
for
the
younger
couple
's
portfolio
.
###
-LRB-
Here
's
how
to
interpret
a
standard
deviation
figure
:
Take
the
expected
return
and
add
one
standard
deviation
to
it
.
###
Then
take
the
expected
return
and
subtract
one
standard
deviation
.
###
In
two
of
three
years
,
the
actual
result
should
fall
within
that
range
if
all
the
assumptions
were
accurate
.
###
Then
add
and
subtract
two
standard
deviations
to
get
a
wider
range
.
###
There
's
a
95
%
probability
any
year
's
result
will
fall
in
the
range
.
-RRB-
###
Of
course
,
the
greater
volatility
of
the
younger
couple
's
portfolio
does
n't
necessarily
mean
those
investments
are
riskier
in
terms
of
meeting
the
holders
'
long-term
goals
.
###
Indeed
,
the
older
couple
's
portfolio
could
actually
be
riskier
in
that
sense
if
the
expected
return
wo
n't
generate
enough
dollars
to
meet
their
spending
plans
.

``
They
may
feel
emotionally

says

Cammack
,

Armstrong

But

or
20
years
in
the
future

###
When
it
comes
to
investing
,
trying
to
weigh
risk
and
reward
can
seem
like
throwing
darts
blindfolded
:
Investors
do
n't
know
the
actual
returns
that
securities
will
deliver
,
or
the
ups
and
downs
that
will
occur
along
the
way
.
###
Looking
to
the
past
can
provide
some
clues
.
###
Over
several
decades
,
for
instance
,
investors
who
put
up
with
the
stock
market
's
gyrations
earned
returns
far
in
excess
of
those
on
bonds
and
``
cash
''
investments
like
Treasury
bills
.
###
But
while
history
can
suggest
what
is
reasonable
to
expect
there
's
no
guarantee
that
the
past
will
repeat
itself
.
###
For
instance
,
some
analysts
believe
bond
returns
and
volatility
have
moved
permanently
closer
to
those
of
the
stock
market
.
###
And
returns
on
cash
investments
may
continue
to
exceed
inflation
by
a
wider
margin
than
they
did
over
the
long-term
past.

A
letter
from
Senator
John
Kerry
chides
us
today
for
implying
that
he
had
``
flip-flopped
''
on
Manuel
Noriega
.
###
He
correctly
says
he
has
been
down
on
Noriega
for
some
time
,
hence
his
criticism
of
administration
mishandling
of
the
attempted
coup
.
###
Our
October
12
editorial
should
have
been
more
precise
.
###
It
meant
to
convey
our
hope
that
the
Senator
and
other
members
of
the
congressional
left
are
broadening
their
dislike
of
Noriega
to
include
other
notorious
Central
American
drug
runners
.
###
The
Sandinistas
of
Nicaragua
,
for
example
,
also
are
part
of
the
Castro-Medellin
cartel
nexus

###
In
his
letter
and
on
the
basis
of
his
losing
vote
Tuesday
against
U.S.
aid
for
the
Nicaraguan
opposition
,
Senator
Kerry
makes
clear
he
has
not
made
that
intellectual
leap
.
###
We
were
wrong
.
###
THROUGHOUT
THE
1980s
,
investors
have
been
looking
for
creative
alternatives
to
traditional
modes
of
financial
planning
.
###
Capital
has
been
democratized
,
and
people
want
in
.
###
Too
often
,
however
,
small
investors
are
left
with
the
same
stale
solutions
that
appealed
to
previous
generations
of
fiduciary
strategists
.
###
Now
a
startling
new
approach
is
available
to
building
your
financial
portfolio
without
undue
risk
,
without
extensive
planning
and
without
hurting
your
life
style
one
bit
This
is
particularly
good
news
for
those
who
hate
risk
,
who
are
incapable
of
doing
extensive
amounts
of
planning
and
who
refuse
to
see
their
life
styles
hurt
in
any
way
.
###
You
know
who
you
are
.
###
My
revolutionary
system
is
also
useful
for
those
who
have
tried
customary
forms
of
growing
their
currency
cushion
.
###
Like
all
Americans
seeking
chronic
prosperity
,
I
do
find
it
necessary
to
plunge
certain
funds
into
conservative
monetary
tools
,
if
only
to
assuage
my
father-in-law
,
who
believes
in
such
things
.
###
So
throughout
the
decade
I
have
maintained
my
share
of
individual
retirement
accounts
and
CDs
,
and
tinkered
with
stocks
,
bonds
and
mutual
funds
,
as
well
as
preserving
my
necessary
position
in
the
residential
real-estate
market
.
###
Return
on
this
fine
portfolio
has
been
modest
when
it
has
not
been
negative
.
###
Figure
1
demonstrates
the
performance
of
those
businesses
I
've
invested
in
during
this
prosperous
decade
-LRB-
see
accompanying
illustration
--
WSJ
Oct.
20
,
1989
-RRB-
.
###
Oil-related
properties
suffered
a
huge
decline
until
I
divested
myself
of
all
such
stocks
in
1985
,
at
which
point
the
industry
,
while
not
lighting
up
any
Christmas
trees
,
began
a
slow
recovery
.
###
Likewise
,
mutual
funds
remained
relatively
flat
until
I
made
what
was
,
for
me
,
a
serious
investment
.
###
By
1987
,
these
properties
were
in
a
tailspin
,
causing
my
broker
at
Pru-Bache
to
remark
that
she
'd
``
never
seen
anything
like
it
.
''
###
Concerned
for
her
state
of
mind
,
I
dropped
them
--
and
the
market
instantly
began
its
steady
climb
back
to
health
.
###
Perhaps
most
dramatic
was
the
performance
of
the
metropolitan
New
York
real-estate
market
,
which
was
booming
until
I
entered
it
in
late
1988
,
at
which
time
it
posted
the
first
negative
compound
annual
growth
rate
in
years
.
###
Disgusted
,
I
cast
around
for
a
different
way
to
plan
my
asset
distribution
,
and
with
hardly
any
heavy
breathing
the
answer
struck
me
:
I
was
doing
it
already
We
've
all
got
money
to
spend
,
some
of
it
clearly
disposable
since
we
keep
disposing
of
it
.
###
Bank
it
?
###
Not
really
Sock
it
away
in
long-term
instruments
?
###
Nonsense
Daily
living
is
the
best
possible
investment
###
Your
priorities
may
be
different
,
but
here
in
Figure
2
is
where
I
've
chosen
to
build
for
the
future
:
personal
space
;
automotive
pursuits
;
children
's
toys
;
gardening
equipment
,
bulbs
and
shrubs
;
and
finally
,
entertainment
,
perhaps
the
best
investment
of
all
.
###
All
have
paid
off
for
me
in
double-digit
annual
growth
and
continue
to
provide
significant
potential
.
###
At
least
,
according
to
my
calculations
.
###
Personal
space
-LRB-
Figure
3
-RRB-
has
grown
35
%
annually
over
the
course
of
the
decade
,
a
performance
that
would
compare
positively
with
an
investment
in
,
say
,
synthetic-leather
products
for
the
interiors
of
cold-weather
vehicles
,
which
my
cousin
got
into
and
sort
of
regrets
to
this
day
.
###
The
assortment
of
expensive
children
's
toys
that
I
have
purchased
wisely
at
a
host
of
discount-toy
brokerage
firms
-LRB-
Figure
4
-RRB-
has
increased
handsomely
in
total
asset
value
far
beyond
any
personal
investment
except
,
perhaps
,
for
my
record
collection
,
whose
worth
,
I
think
it
's
safe
to
say
,
is
incalculable
.
###
Continued
investment
in
my
1984
subcompact
has
been
part
of
my
strategy
-LRB-
Figure
5
-RRB-
,
with
present
annual
contributions
now
equaling
more
than
60
%
of
the
car
's
original
value
.
###
According
to
my
calculations
,
these
outlays
should
have
brought
the
value
of
my
sedan
to
more
than
$
22,000
on
the
open
market
-LRB-
Figure
6
-RRB-
,
where
I
plan
to
offer
it
shortly
.
###
Expansion
of
my
living
space
has
produced
an
obvious
need
for
maintenance
and
construction
of
suitable
lawns
,
shrubs
and
bushes
fitting
to
its
suburban
locale
.
###
I
have
thus
committed
sufficient
personal
outlay
to
ensure
that
my
grounds
and
lodgings
will
never
be
short
of
greens
and
flowers
.
###
My
initial
stake
in
this
blooming
enterprise
has
grown
tenfold
,
according
to
my
conservative
calculations
.
###
At
the
same
time
,
my
share
in
a
wide
variety
of
entertainment
pursuits
has
given
perhaps
the
most
dramatic
demonstration
of
the
benefits
of
creative
personal
financial
planning
.
###
Over
the
course
of
the
decade
,
for
instance
,
my
return
on
investment
in
the
area
of
poker
alone
-LRB-
Figures
7A
and
7B
-RRB-
has
been
most
impressive
,
showing
bodacious
annual
expansion
with
--
given
the
way
my
associates
play
--
no
sign
of
abatement
into
the
1990s
and
beyond
.
###
With
this
personal
strategy
firmly
in
place
,
I
look
forward
to
years
of
fine
life-style
investments
and
increasing
widespread
leverage
.
###
My
kids
'
college
education
looms
as
perhaps
the
greatest
future
opportunity
for
spending
,
although
I
'll
probably
have
to
cash
in
their
toy
portfolio
to
take
advantage
of
it
.
###
But
with
every
step
I
take
,
I
'm
building
wealth
.
###
You
can
,
too
,
if
you
,
like
me
,
refuse
to
bite
the
bullet
.
###
So
go
out
there
and
eat
that
debt
.
###
You
're
right
there
in
the
mainstream
of
American
business
,
building
value
on
the
back
of
insupportable
expenditures
.
###
Henry
Kravis
,
watch
out
###
Mr.
Schwartz
is
a
business
executive
and
writer
in
New
York
.
###
WHEN
JAMES
SCHWARTZ
was
just
a
lad
his
father
gave
him
a
piece
of
career
advice
.
###
``
He
told
me
to
choose
an
area
where
just
by
being
mediocre
I
could
be
great
,
''
recalls
Mr.
Schwartz
,
now
40
.
###
He
tried
management
consulting
,
traded
in
turquoise
for
a
while
,
and
even
managed
professional
wrestlers
.
###
Now
he
has
settled
into
a
career
that
fits
the
bill
--
financial
planning
.
###
It
should
be
noted
that
Mr.
Schwartz
,
who
operates
out
of
Englewood
,
Colo.
,
is
a
puckish
sort
who
likes
to
give
his
colleagues
the
needle
.
###
But
in
this
case
the
needle
has
a
very
sharp
point
.
###
Though
it
's
probably
safe
to
assume
that
the
majority
of
financial
planners
are
honest
and
even
reasonably
competent
,
the
fact
remains
that
,
as
one
wag
puts
it
,
``
anybody
who
can
fog
a
mirror
''
can
call
himself
a
financial
planner
.
###
Planners
now
influence
the
investment
of
several
hundred
billion
dollars
,
but
in
effect
they
operate
in
the
dark
.
###
There
is
no
effective
regulation
of
planners
,
no
accepted
standard
for
admission
into
their
ranks
--
a
dog
got
into
one
trade
group
--
no
way
to
assess
their
performance
,
no
way
even
to
know
how
many
of
them
there
are
-LRB-
estimates
range
from
60,000
to
450,000
-RRB-
.
###
All
anyone
need
do
is
hang
up
a
shingle
and
start
planning
.
###
So
it
should
come
as
no
shock
that
the
profession
,
if
that
's
what
it
is
,
has
attracted
a
lot
of
people
whose
principal
talents
seem
to
be
frittering
away
or
flat-out
stealing
their
clients
'
money
.
###
Alarmed
,
state
and
federal
authorities
are
trying
to
devise
ways
to
certify
and
regulate
planners
.
###
Industry
groups
and
reputable
planners
who
are
members
of
them
want
comprehensive
standards
,
too
;
they
're
tired
of
seeing
practitioners
depicted
collectively
in
the
business
press
as
dumber
than
chimpanzees
and
greedier
than
a
herd
of
swine
.
###
But
reform
has
n't
taken
hold
yet
.
###
``
The
industry
is
still
pretty
much
in
its
Wild
West
days
,
''
says
Scott
Stapf
,
director
of
investor
education
for
the
North
American
Securities
Administrators
Association
.
###
An
admittedly
limited
survey
by
NASAA
,
whose
members
are
state
securities-law
regulators
,
found
that
between
1986
and
1988
``
fraud
and
abuse
''
by
financial
planners
cost
22,000
investors
$
400
million
.
###
The
rogues
'
gallery
of
planners
involved
includes
some
convicted
felons
,
a
compulsive
gambler
or
two
,
various
businessmen
who
had
planned
their
own
previous
ventures
right
into
bankruptcy
,
and
one
man
who
scammed
his
wife
's
grandmother
.
###
What
's
more
,
the
losses
they
and
the
others
caused
``
are
just
what
we
are
stumbling
over
,
''
says
Mr.
Stapf
,
adding
that
the
majority
of
misdeeds
probably
go
undetected
.
###
So
do
just
about
all
the
losses
that
could
be
attributed
to
the
sheer
incompetence
of
unqualified
planners
.
###
Nobody
can
estimate
the
toll
,
but
John
Gargan
,
a
Tampa
,
Fla.
,
planner
and
head
of
one
trade
group
,
the
International
Association
of
Registered
Financial
Planners
,
thinks
the
danger
to
investors
from
incompetence
is
``
humongous
,
''
far
greater
than
that
from
crookery
.
###
His
group
,
like
others
,
wants
minimum
standards
applied
to
all
who
call
themselves
financial
planners
.
###
Surveying
all
this
,
some
people
now
think
the
best
planner
might
be
no
planner
at
all
.
###
For
most
investors
``
the
benefits
just
are
n't
worth
the
risks
,
''
says
Barbara
Roper
,
who
follows
financial-planning
issues
for
the
Consumer
Federation
of
America
,
a
consumer-advocacy
organization
based
in
Washington
.
###
She
concedes
that
such
a
position
is
``
unfair
''
to
the
thousands
of
conscientious
and
qualified
people
plying
the
trade
,
but
as
a
consumer
advocate
she
feels
impelled
to
take
it
.
###
She
says
her
group
used
to
give
tips
on
selecting
planners
--
check
educational
and
experience
credentials
,
consult
regulators
and
Better
Business
Bureaus
--
but
found
that
even
some
people
who
took
these
steps
``
were
still
getting
ripped
off
.
''
###
The
bad
news
,
however
,
has
n't
been
bad
enough
to
kill
the
growing
demand
for
financial
planning
.
###
The
Tax
Reform
Act
of
1986
,
which
eliminated
many
tax
shelters
peddled
by
planners
,
and
the
stock
market
crash
the
next
year
did
cause
a
sharp
slump
in
such
demand
,
and
many
planners
had
to
make
an
unplanned
exit
from
the
business
.
###
But
membership
in
the
International
Association
of
Financial
Planners
-LRB-
IAFP
-RRB-
,
the
industry
's
biggest
trade
group
,
is
still
nearly
triple
what
it
was
in
1980
,
and
it
's
believed
that
the
ranks
of
planners
who
do
n't
belong
to
any
group
have
soared
as
well
.
###
An
estimated
10
million
Americans
are
now
using
financial
planners
,
and
the
pool
of
capital
they
influence
is
enormous
.
###
A
survey
of
54,000
of
them
conducted
by
the
IAFP
in
April
showed
that
these
practitioners
alone
had
controlled
or
guided
the
investment
of
$
154
billion
of
their
clients
'
money
in
the
previous
12
months
.
###
The
sheer
number
of
planners
makes
the
business
extremely
difficult
,
if
not
impossible
,
to
regulate
.
###
Even
the
minority
of
them
who
must
register
with
the
Securities
and
Exchange
Commission
as
``
investment
advisers
''
--
people
who
are
in
the
business
of
counseling
others
on
the
buying
and
selling
of
securities
specifically
--
have
been
enough
to
swamp
the
agency
's
capacity
.
###
The
SEC
has
only
about
200
staffers
assigned
to
keep
tabs
on
investment
advisers
--
about
the
same
as
in
1980
--
even
though
the
number
of
advisers
has
tripled
to
about
15,000
over
the
past
decade
.
###
Currently
,
a
registered
investment
adviser
can
expect
an
SEC
audit
only
once
every
12
years
.
###
A
lot
of
bad
things
can
happen
in
12
years
.
###
``
It
does
n't
take
a
rocket
scientist
to
figure
out
our
problem
,
''
says
Kathryn
McGrath
,
director
of
the
SEC
's
division
of
investment
management
.
###
So
the
SEC
has
proposed
to
Congress
that
much
of
the
job
of
oversight
be
turned
over
to
an
industry-funded
,
self-regulatory
organization
patterned
on
the
National
Association
of
Securities
Dealers
,
which
operates
in
the
brokerage
business
.
###
Such
an
organization
could
,
among
other
things
,
set
minimum
standards
for
competence
,
ethics
and
finances
and
punish
those
investment
advisers
who
broke
the
rules
.
###
The
proposal
has
set
off
a
lively
debate
within
an
industry
that
was
far
from
united
to
begin
with
.
###
Mr.
Schwartz
,
the
puckish
planner
from
Englewood
,
Colo.
,
says
that
allowing
the
business
to
police
itself
would
be
``
like
putting
Dracula
in
charge
of
the
blood
bank
.
''
###
Mr.
Gargan
,
the
Tampa
planner
who
heads
one
trade
group
,
favors
simply
assessing
the
industry
and
giving
the
money
to
the
SEC
to
hire
more
staff
.
###
-LRB-
Mr.
Gargan
's
views
are
not
greeted
with
wild
enthusiasm
over
at
the
IAFP
,
the
major
industry
organization
.
###
When
the
IAFP
recently
assembled
other
industry
groups
to
discuss
common
standards
that
might
be
applied
to
planners
,
Mr.
Gargan
's
group
was
excluded
.
###
That
may
be
because
Mr.
Gargan
,
smarting
at
what
he
considered
slurs
on
his
membership
standards
made
by
the
rival
group
,
enrolled
his
dog
,
Beauregard
,
as
a
member
of
the
IAFP
.
###
Then
he
sent
the
pooch
's
picture
with
the
certificate
of
membership
--
it
was
made
out
to
``
Boris
`
Bo
'
Regaard
''
--
to
every
newspaper
he
could
think
of
.
###
The
states
have
their
own
ideas
about
regulation
and
certification
.
###
NASAA
,
the
organization
of
state
securities
regulators
,
is
pushing
for
a
model
regulatory
statute
already
adopted
in
eight
states
.
###
It
requires
financial
planners
to
register
with
states
,
pass
competency
tests
and
reveal
to
customers
any
conflicts
of
interest
.
###
The
most
common
conflict
involves
compensation
.
###
NASAA
estimates
that
nearly
90
%
of
planners
receive
some
or
all
of
their
income
from
sales
commissions
on
securities
,
insurance
and
other
financial
products
they
recommend
.
###
The
issue
:
Is
the
planner
putting
his
clients
into
the
best
investments
,
or
the
ones
that
garner
the
biggest
commissions
?
###
In
1986
the
New
York
attorney
general
's
office
got
an
order
from
a
state
court
in
Albany
shutting
down
First
Meridian
Corp.
,
an
Albany
financial-planning
firm
that
had
invested
$
55
million
on
behalf
of
nearly
1,000
investors
.
###
In
its
notice
of
action
,
the
attorney
general
said
the
company
had
promised
to
put
clients
into
``
balanced
''
investment
portfolios
;
instead
,
the
attorney
general
alleged
,
the
company
consistently
shoved
unwary
customers
into
high-risk
investments
in
paintings
,
coins
and
Florida
condos
.
###
Those
investments
paid
big
commissions
to
First
Meridian
,
payments
investors
were
never
told
about
,
the
attorney
general
alleged
.
###
Investors
were
further
assured
that
only
those
with
a
minimun
net
worth
would
be
accepted
.
###
In
practice
,
the
attorney
general
alleged
in
an
affidavit
,
if
an
investor
had
access
to
cash
``
the
chances
of
being
turned
down
by
First
Meridian
were
about
as
probable
as
being
rejected
by
the
Book-of-the-Month
Club
.
''
###
And
,
the
attorney
general
added
,
First
Meridian
's
president
,
Roger
V.
Sala
,
portrayed
himself
as
a
``
financial
expert
''
when
his
qualifications
largely
consisted
of
a
high-school
diploma
,
work
as
a
real-estate
and
insurance
salesman
,
and
a
stint
as
supervisor
at
a
highway
toll
booth
.
###
First
Meridian
and
its
officials
are
currently
under
investigation
for
possible
criminal
wrongdoing
,
according
to
a
spokeswoman
for
the
attorney
general
.
###
Harry
Manion
,
Mr.
Sala
's
attorney
,
says
his
client
denies
any
wrongdoing
and
adds
that
the
attorney
general
's
contentions
about
First
Meridian
's
business
practices
are
incorrect
.
###
As
for
Mr.
Sala
's
qualifications
,
``
the
snooty
attorneys
for
the
state
of
New
York
decided
Mr.
Sala
was
n't
qualified
because
he
did
n't
have
a
Harvard
degree
,
''
says
Mr.
Manion
.
###
Civil
suits
against
planners
by
clients
seeking
recovery
of
funds
are
increasingly
common
.
###
Two
such
actions
,
both
filed
earlier
this
year
in
Georgia
state
court
in
Atlanta
,
could
be
particularly
embarrassing
to
the
industry
:
both
name
J.
Chandler
Peterson
,
an
Atlanta
financial
planner
who
is
a
founder
and
past
chairman
of
the
IAFP
,
as
defendant
.
###
One
suit
,
filed
by
more
than
three
dozen
investors
,
charges
that
Mr.
Peterson
misused
much
of
the
$
9.7
million
put
into
a
limited
partnership
that
he
operated
and
promoted
,
spending
some
of
it
to
pay
his
own
legal
bills
and
to
invest
in
other
companies
in
which
he
had
an
interest
.
###
Those
companies
,
in
turn
,
paid
Mr.
Peterson
commissions
and
fees
,
the
suit
alleges
.
###
The
other
suit
was
filed
by
two
men
in
a
dispute
over
$
100,000
investments
each
says
he
made
with
Mr.
Peterson
as
part
of
an
effort
to
purchase
the
Bank
of
Scottsdale
in
Scottsdale
,
Ariz
.
###
One
plaintiff
,
a
doctor
,
testified
in
an
affidavit
that
he
also
gave
Mr.
Peterson
$
50,000
to
join
a
sort
of
investment
club
which
essentially
gave
the
physician
``
the
privilege
of
making
additional
investments
''
with
Mr.
Peterson
.
###
In
affidavits
,
each
plaintiff
claims
Mr.
Peterson
promised
the
bank
purchase
would
be
completed
by
the
end
of
1988
or
the
money
returned
.
###
Mr.
Peterson
took
the
plaintiffs
'
and
other
investors
'
money
to
a
meeting
of
the
bank
's
directors
.
###
Wearing
a
business
suit
and
western-style
hat
and
boots
,
he
opened
up
his
briefcase
and
dumped
$
1
million
in
cash
on
a
table
in
front
of
the
directors
,
says
Myron
Diebel
,
the
bank
's
president
.
###
``
He
said
he
wanted
to
show
the
color
of
his
money
,
''
recalls
Mr.
Diebel
.
###
Bank
officials
,
however
,
showed
him
the
door
,
and
the
sale
never
came
off
.
###
According
to
the
suit
,
Mr.
Peterson
has
yet
to
return
the
plaintiffs
'
investment
.
###
They
want
it
back
.
###
Mr.
Peterson
declines
to
comment
on
specific
allegations
in
the
two
suits
,
saying
he
prefers
to
save
such
responses
for
court
.
###
But
he
does
say
that
all
of
his
activities
have
been
``
entirely
proper
.
''
###
On
the
suit
by
the
limited
partners
,
he
says
he
is
considering
a
defamation
suit
against
the
plaintiffs
.
###
The
suit
,
he
adds
,
``
is
almost
in
the
nature
of
a
vendetta
by
a
handful
of
disgruntled
people
.
''
###
Rearding
the
suit
over
the
bank
bid
,
Mr.
Peterson
says
it
is
filled
with
``
inflammatory
language
and
half
truths
.
''
###
He
declines
to
go
into
specifics
.
###
Mr.
Peterson
says
the
suits
against
him
are
less
a
measure
of
his
work
than
they
are
a
``
sign
of
the
times
''
in
which
people
generally
are
more
prone
to
sue
.
###
``
I
do
n't
know
anybody
in
the
industry
who
has
n't
experienced
litigation
,
''
he
says
.
###
Mr.
Peterson
also
says
he
does
n't
consider
himself
a
financial
planner
anymore
.
###
He
now
calls
himself
an
``
investment
banker
.
''
###
In
many
scams
or
alleged
scams
involving
planners
,
it
's
plain
that
only
a
modicum
of
common
sense
on
the
part
of
the
investors
would
have
kept
them
out
of
harm
's
way
.
###
Using
it
,
would
n't
a
proessional
hesitate
to
pay
tens
of
thousands
of
dollars
just
for
a
chance
to
invest
witha
planner
?
###
Other
cases
go
to
show
that
an
old
saw
still
applies
:
If
it
sounds
too
good
to
be
true
,
it
probably
is
.
###
Certificates
of
deposit
do
n't
pay
23
%
a
year
,
for
example
,
but
that
did
n't
give
pause
to
clients
of
one
Alabama
planner
.
###
Now
they
're
losers
and
he
's
in
jail
in
Mobile
County
.
###
CDs
yielding
40
%
are
even
more
implausible
--
especially
when
the
issuing
``
bank
''
in
the
Marshall
Islands
is
merely
a
mail
drop
watched
over
by
a
local
gas-station
operator
--
but
investors
fell
for
that
one
too
.
###
And
the
Colorado
planner
who
promised
to
make
some
of
his
clients
millionaires
on
investments
of
as
litle
as
$
100
?
###
Never
mind
.
###
You
already
know
the
answer
.
###
Mr.
Emshwiller
is
a
staff
reporter
in
The
Wall
Street
Journal
's
Los
Angeles
bureau
.
###
At
the
ritzy
Fashion
Island
Shopping
Center
,
the
tanned
and
elegant
ladies
of
this
wealthy
Southern
California
beach
community
disembark
from
their
Mercedes-Benzes
and
BMWs
for
another
day
of
exercising
their
credit
cards
.
###
They
root
among
the
designer
offerings
at
Neiman-Marcus
and
Bullocks
Wilshire
.
###
They
stroll
through
the
marble-encased
corridors
of
the
Atrium
Court
.
###
They
graze
at
the
Farmers
Market
,
a
combination
gourmet
food
court
and
grocery
store
,
while
a
pianist
accompanies
the
noon
fashion
show
with
a
selection
of
dreamy
melodies
.
###
``
The
beautiful
look
of
wool
,
''
croons
the
show
's
narrator
,
``
slightly
Victorian
in
its
influence
...
.
''
###
Meanwhile
,
in
the
squat
office
buildings
that
ring
Fashion
Island
,
the
odds
are
good
that
someone
is
getting
fleeced
.
###
Law-enforcement
authorities
say
that
at
any
given
time
,
a
host
of
fraudulent
telemarketing
operations
mingle
with
the
many
legitimate
businesses
here
.
###
``
They
seem
to
like
these
industrial
parks
,
''
says
Kacy
McClelland
,
a
postal
inspector
who
specializes
in
mail
fraud
.
###
``
We
call
them
fraud
farms

''
###
Welcome
to
that
welter
of
contradictions
known
as
Newport
Beach
.
###
This
city
of
more
than
70,000
is
known
for
sunshine
,
yachts
and
rich
residents
.
###
It
is
also
known
as
the
fraud
capital
of
the
U.S.
,
dubbed
by
investigators
and
the
media
as
the
``
Cote
de
Fraud
''
.
###
How
does
a
community
famous
for
its
high
living
end
up
as
a
haven
for
low-lifes
?
###
Clearly
,
the
existence
of
the
former
lures
the
latter
.
###
The
places
renowned
for
breeding
bunco
,
like
the
Miami
neighborhood
known
as
the
``
Maggot
Mile
''
and
Las
Vegas
's
flashy
strip
of
casinos
,
invariably
offer
fast
cars
,
high
rollers
,
glamorous
women
and
lots
of
sunshine
.
###
You
do
n't
hear
much
about
unusual
concentrations
of
fraud
in
Green
Bay
or
Buffalo
.
###
Con
men
hate
snow
.
###
Newport
Beach
fits
the
scam
artists
'
specifications
perfectly
.
###
What
more
could
a
con
man
in
search
of
the
easy
life
ask
for
?
###
Nothing
seems
hard
here
.
###
The
breezes
are
soft
,
the
waves
lap
gently
and
the
palm
trees
sway
lazily
.
###
Nightlife
is
plentiful
.
###
Moreover
,
ostentation
is
appreciated
.
###
The
median
price
of
homes
is
$
547,000
;
more
than
9,000
vessels
fill
what
the
chamber
of
commerce
calls
the
nation
's
largest
pleasure-boat
harbor
.
###
``
Blondes
,
cocaine
and
Corvettes
,
''
mutters
Mr.
McClelland
.
###
``
That
's
what
they
're
after
.
''
###
The
rich
image
of
Newport
Beach
also
helps
lend
the
con
artists
'
operation
an
air
of
respectability
.
###
``
One
reason
they
use
Newport
Beach
is
that
it
sounds
swankier
than
most
addresses
,
''
says
David
Katz
,
a
U.S.
attorney
who
,
until
recently
,
headed
a
multi-agency
Southern
California
fraud
task
force
.
###
``
Newport
Beach
is
known
in
Rhode
Island
for
having
a
lot
of
rich
people
.
''
###
No
wonder
all
kinds
of
big-time
scams
have
flourished
here
,
from
phony
tax-sheltered
Bible
sales
to
crooked
car
dealers
to
bogus
penny-stock
traders
.
###
But
above
all
,
this
is
the
national
headquarters
for
boiler-room
operators
,
those
slick-talking
snake-oil
salesmen
who
use
the
telephone
to
extract
money
from
the
gullible
and
the
greedy
and
then
vanish
.
###
Because
only
a
fraction
of
them
are
ever
prosecuted
,
nobody
really
knows
how
much
money
bogus
telemarketing
operators
really
harvest
.
###
``
I
've
heard
that
there
is
$
40
billion
taken
in
nationwide
by
boiler
rooms
every
year
,
''
Mr.
McClelland
says
.
###
``
If
that
's
true
,
Orange
County
has
to
be
at
least
10
%
of
that
.
''
###
And
most
of
the
truly
big
scams
in
Orange
County
seem
to
originate
in
Newport
Beach
or
one
of
the
other
well-heeled
communities
that
surround
this
sliver-like
city
that
hooks
around
a
point
of
land
on
the
California
coast
south
of
Los
Angeles
.
###
In
fact
,
sophisticated
big-bucks
boiler-room
scams
are
known
generically
among
law-enforcement
types
as
``
Newport
Beach
''
operations
.
###
That
contrasts
with
the
penny-ante
sales
of
things
such
as
pen-and-pencil
sets
and
office
supplies
that
are
known
as
``
Hollywood
''
scams
.
###
Newport
Beach
telemarketers
concentrate
on
precious
metals
and
oil-leasing
deals
that
typically
cost
thousands
of
dollars
a
shot
.
###
The
investors
range
from
elderly
widows
to
affluent
professionals
.
###
In
one
ingenious
recent
example
of
a
Newport
Beach
boiler
room
,
prospective
investors
in
Capital
Trust
Inc.
were
allegedly
told
that
their
investment
in
precious
metals
was
insured
against
losses
``
caused
by
employees
due
to
dishonesty
,
destruction
or
disappearance
,
''
according
to
an
indictment
handed
up
by
a
federal
grand
jury
in
Los
Angeles
last
month
.
###
Thus
falsely
reassured
,
investors
sent
$
11.4
million
to
the
Newport
Beach
company
,
most
of
which
was
diverted
to
unauthorized
uses
,
the
indictment
charges
.
###
Douglas
Jones
,
an
attorney
representing
Richard
O.
Kelly
Sr.
,
the
chairman
and
president
of
Capital
Trust
,
says
his
client
denies
that
there
was
any
attempt
to
defraud
investors
.
###
``
There
were
some
business
deals
that
went
bad
,
''
Mr.
Jones
says
,
``
but
no
intent
to
defraud
.
''
###
Newport
Beach
operations
differ
from
the
Hollywood
boiler
rooms
in
style
as
well
as
in
dollars
.
###
Traditionally
,
boiler
rooms
operate
on
the
cheap
,
since
few
,
if
any
,
customers
ever
visit
their
offices
.
###
Indeed
,
the
name
derives
from
the
tendency
among
telemarketing
scammers
to
rent
cheap
basement
space
,
near
the
boiler
room
.
###
But
,
says
Mr.
Katz
,
the
U.S.
attorney
,
``
the
interesting
thing
about
Newport
Beach
operations
is
that
they
give
themselves
the
indulgence
of
beautiful
offices
,
with
plush
furnishings
.
###
When
we
go
there
,
it
's
quite
different
from
these
Hollywood
places
where
the
sandwiches
are
spread
out
on
the
table
and
the
people
are
picking
their
noses
.
''
###
The
Newport
Beach
operators
also
tend
to
indulge
themselves
privately
.
###
Investigators
cite
the
case
of
Matthew
Valentine
,
who
is
currently
serving
a
six-year
sentence
at
Lompoc
Federal
Prison
for
his
role
in
Intech
Investment
Corp.
,
which
promised
investors
returns
of
as
much
as
625
%
on
precious
metals
.
###
Mr.
Valentine
,
who
pleaded
guilty
to
five
counts
of
fraud
in
federal
court
in
Los
Angeles
,
drove
a
leased
Mercedes
and
lived
in
an
expensive
home
on
Lido
Isle
,
an

YOU
WENT
to
college
and
thought
you
got
an
education
.
###
Now
you
discover
that
you
never
learned
the
most
important
lesson
:
How
to
send
your
kids
to
college
.
###
True
,
when
you
went
to
college
,
there
was
n't
that
much
to
learn
.
###
Stick
some
money
in
an
interest-bearing
account
and
watch
it
grow
.
###
Now
,
investment
salesmen
say
it
's
time
to
take
some
risks
if
you
want
the
kind
of
returns
that
will
buy
your
toddler
a
ticket
to
Prestige
U.
in
18
years
.
###
In
short
,
throw
away
the
passbook
and
go
for
the
glory
.
###
The
reason
is
cost
.
###
Nothing
in
the
annals
of
tuition
readied
parents
for
the
1980s
.
###
Tuitions
at
private
colleges
rose
154
%
in
the
10
years
ended
in
June
of
this
year
;
that
's
twice
the
77
%
increase
in
consumer
prices
for
the
same
period
.
###
A
year
at
Harvard
now
goes
for
$
19,395
.
###
By
2007
,
when
this
year
's
newborns
hit
campus
,
a
four-year
Ivy
League
sheepskin
will
cost
$
300,000
,
give
or
take
a
few
pizzas-with-everything
at
exam
time
.
###
Stanford
,
MIT
and
other
utmosts
will
cost
no
less
.
###
So
what
's
a
parent
to
do
?
###
Some
investment
advisers
are
suggesting
,
in
effect
,
a
bet
on
a
start-up
investment
pool
--
maybe
even
on
margin
.
###
Others
prefer
deep-discount
zero-coupon
bonds
.
###
Still
others
say
,
Why
not
take
a
chance
on
a
high-octane
growth
fund
?
###
``
You
're
not
going
to
make
it
in
a
5
%
bank
account
,
''
says
James
Riepe
,
director
of
mutual
funds
at
T.
Rowe
Price
.
###
To
get
the
necessary
growth
,
adds
Murray
Ruffel
,
a
marketing
official
at
the
Financial
Programs
mutual-fund
group
,
``
you
need
to
go
to
the
stock
market
.
''
###
In
other
words
,
a
little
volatility
never
hurt
.
###
It
never
hurt
anyone
,
that
is
,
unless
the
growth
funds
do
n't
grow
when
you
need
them
to
.
###
Or
the
zero-coupon
bonds
turn
out
not
to
have
been
discounted
deeply
enough
to
pay
your
kid
's
tuition
.
###
That
's
the
dilemma
for
today
's
parent
.
###
Although
many
experts
are
advising
risk
,
no
one
has
a
good
answer
for
you
if
the
risk
does
n't
pay
off
.
###
Help
may
be
on
the
way
.
###
The
antitrust
division
of
the
Justice
Department
is
investigating
the
oddly
similar
tuition
charges
and
increases
among
the
top
schools
.
###
Fear
of
the
price
police
could
help
cool
things
off
in
the
1990s
.
###
And
then
there
's
always
State
U
.
###
But
parents
'
craving
for
a
top-rated
education
for
their
children
is
growing
like
their
taste
for
fancy
wheels
and
vintage
wine
.
###
Belatedly
aware
of
public
concern
,
lawmakers
and
financial
middlemen
are
working
overtime
to
create
and
sell
college
savings
and
investment
schemes
.
###
Their
message
,
explicit
or
implicit
,
is
that
a
good
college
will
cost
so
much
by
whenever
you
want
it
that
the
tried
and
true
wo
n't
do
anymore
.
###
Forget
about
Treasury
bills
or
a
money-market
fund
.
###
The
latest
wave
of
marketing
is
instructive
.
###
Several
outfits
--
including
the
Financial
Programs
,
Franklin
,
and
T.
Rowe
Price
mutual-fund
groups
and
the
Edward
D.
Jones
brokerage
house
--
are
advertising
``
college
planner
''
tables
and
charts
that
tell
you
how
much
you
need
to
put
aside
regularly
.
###
The
calculations
generally
rely
on
an
after-tax
rate
of
return
of
8
%
annually
--
a
rate
historically
obtainable
by
the
individual
in
only
one
place
,
the
stock
market
.
###
Most
of
the
mailers
are
free
,
but
Denver-based
Financial
Programs
sells
,
for
$
15
,
a
version
customized
to
the
age
of
the
child
and
the
college
of
choice
.
###
The
figures
are
shocking
.
###
To
build
a
nest
egg
that
would
pay
for
Stanford
when
a
current
first-grader
reaches
college
age
,
parents
would
need
to
set
aside
$
773.94
a
month
--
for
12
years
.
###
They
can
cut
this
to
$
691.09
a
month
if
the
investing
keeps
up
through
college
.
###
And
they
can
further
reduce
the
monthly
amount
if
they
start
saving
earlier
--
when
mother
and
child
come
home
from
the
hospital
.
###
Plugging
a
cheaper
college
into
the
formulas
still
does
n't
generate
an
installment
most
people
can
live
with
.
###
Using
a
recent
average
private-school
cost
of
about
$
12,500
a
year
,
T.
Rowe
Price
's
planner
prescribes
$
450
monthly
if
the
plan
begins
when
the
child
is
six
.
###
Since
the
formula
assumes
an
8
%
before-tax
return
in
a
mutual
fund
,
there
would
also
be
$
16,500
in
taxes
to
pay
over
the
12
years
.
###
Not
everyone
is
so
pessimistic
.
###
``
People
are
basically
peddling
a
lot
of
fear
,
''
says
Arthur
Hauptman
,
a
consultant
to
the
American
Council
on
Education
in
Washington
.
###
He
takes
issue
with
projections
that
do
n't
factor
in
students
'
own
contribution
,
which
reduces
most
parents
'
burden
substantially
.
###
Still
,
he
says
,
``
it
's
no
bad
thing
''
if
all
the
marketing
prods
people
into
putting
aside
a
little
more
.
``
###
The
situation
you
want
to
avoid
is
having
somebody
not
save
anything
and
hope
they
'll
be
able
to
do
it
out
of
current
income
,
''
he
says
.
###
``
That
's
crazy
.
''
###
His
advice
:
Do
n't
panic
.
###
Parents
,
he
says
,
should
aim
at
whatever
regular
investment
sum
they
can
afford
.
###
Half
the
amount
that
the
investment
tables
suggest
might
be
a
good
goal
,
he
adds
.
###
That
way
,
parents
will
reduce
borrowings
and
outlays
from
current
income
when
the
time
comes
to
pay
tuition
.
###
Mr.
Hauptman
reckons
that
the
best
investment
choice
is
mutual
funds
because
they
are
managed
and
over
time
have
nearly
kept
up
with
the
broad
stock
averages
.
###
He
favors
either
an
all-stock
fund
or
a
balanced
fund
that
mixes
both
stocks
and
bonds
.
###
In
their
anxiety
,
however
,
parents
and
other
student
benefactors
are
flocking
to
new
schemes
.
###
They
have
laid
out
about
$
1
billion
for
so-called
baccalaureate
zero-coupon
municipal
bonds
--
so
far
offered
by
Connecticut
,
Illinois
,
Virginia
and
eight
other
states
.
###
And
they
have
bought
about
$
500
million
in
prepaid-tuition
plans
,
offered
in
Michigan
,
Florida
and
Wyoming
.
###
The
prepaid
plans
take
payment
today
--
usually
at
current
tuitions
or
at
a
slight
discount
--
for
a
promise
that
tuition
will
be
covered
tomorrow
.
###
The
baccalaureate
bonds
--
tax-free
,
offered
in
small
denominations
and
usually
containing
a
provision
that
they
wo
n't
be
called
before
maturity
--
seem
to
be
tailor-made
for
college
savers
.
###
Like
other
zeros
,
they
pay
all
their
interest
at
maturity
,
meaning
that
buyers
can
time
things
so
that
their
bonds
pay
off
just
when
Junior
graduates
from
high
school
.
###
Their
compounding
effect
is
also
alluring
.
###
In
June
,
Virginia
sold
bonds
for
$
268.98
that
will
pay
$
1,000
in
2009
.
###
But
Richard
Anderson
,
head
of
the
Forum
for
College
Financing
Alternatives
,
at
Columbia
University
,
a
research
group
partly
financed
by
the
federal
government
,
says
zeros
are
particularly
ill-suited
.
###
Their
price
falls
further
than
that
of
other
bonds
when
inflation
and
interest
rates
kick
up
.
###
That
wo
n't
matter
if
they
are
held
to
maturity
,
but
if
,
for
any
reason
,
the
parents
need
to
sell
them
before
then
,
there
could
be
a
severe
loss
of
principal
.
###
Had
zeros
been
available
in
1972
and
had
parents
bought
a
face
amount
equal
to
four
years
'
tuition
at
the
time
,
aiming
for
their
children
's
1988
enrollment
,
they
would
have
been
left
with
only
enough
to
pay
for
two
years
,
Mr.
Anderson
figures
.
###
Most
other
bonds
,
however
,
would
probably
not
have
fared
much
better
.
###
The
prepaid
plans
may
be
a
good
bet
,
provided
the
guarantee
of
future
tuition
is
secure
.
###
Issuing
states
generally
limit
the
guarantees
to
in-state
institutions
,
however
,
and
buyers
get
refunds
without
much
interest
if
the
children
do
n't
attend
the
specified
schools
.
###
Two
private
groups
are
seeking
Securities
and
Exchange
Commission
approval
for
plans
that
could
be
more
broadly
transferable
.
###
Mr.
Anderson
wants
the
prestige
colleges
to
sponsor
such
a
plan
.
###
The
issue
here
may
be
the
soundness
of
the
guarantee
.
###
Prepayments
,
much
like
mutual-fund
purchases
,
are
pooled
for
investment
.
###
Sponsors
are
naturally
counting
on
their
ability
to
keep
ahead
of
tuition
inflation
with
investment
returns
.
###
But
buyers
are
essentially
betting
on
a
start-up
investment
fund
with
no
track
record
--
and
some
have
been
encouraged
to
borrow
to
do
so
.
###
One
problem
is
that
the
Internal
Revenue
Service
has
decided
that
the
investment
earnings
and
gains
of
the
sponsors
'
funds
are
taxable
.
###
The
colleges
,
as
educational
institutions
,
had
hoped
that
would
n't
be
the
case
.
###
Based
on
historical
rates
of
return
,
Mr.
Anderson
reckons
a
100
%
stock
portfolio
,
indexed
to
the
market
,
would
have
kept
up
with
tuition
and
taxes
in
the
20th
century
.
###
But
sponsors
might
not
pick
the
stocks
that
will
match
the
market
.
###
And
they
're
leaning
more
toward
fixed
income
,
whose
returns
after
tax
have
trailed
tuition
increases
.
###
``
I
'm
not
sure
they
're
going
to
make
it
work
,
''
says
Mr.
Anderson
.
###
What
happens
if
the
sponsors
do
n't
have
the
cash
to
pay
the
tuitions
?
###
Florida
and
Wyoming
have
backed
up
their
guarantees
with
the
full
faith
and
credit
of
the
state
governments
,
meaning
that
taxpayers
will
pick
up
any
slack
.
###
Not
so
Michigan
.
###
Its
plan
is
set
up
as
an
independent
agency
.
###
The
state
says
there
's
no
worry
--
investment
returns
,
combined
with
fees
and
the
gains
from
unused
plans
,
will
provide
all
the
cash
it
needs
.

Mr.
Putka

education

The

Street
Journal

Boston
bureau

If
you
start
saving
for
your
child
's
eduction
on
Jan.
1
,
1990
,
here
's
the
monthly
sum
you
will
need
to
invest
to
pay
for
four
years
at

AMONG
THE
CATFISH
farmers
in
the
watery
delta
land
of
Humphreys
County
,
Miss.
,
Allen
D.
Tharp
of
Isola
was
one
of
the
best
known
and
most
enterprising
.
###
He
sold
quarter-inch
fingerlings
to
stock
other
farmers
'
ponds
,
and
he
bought
back
one-pound-or-so
food-fish
that
he
``
live-hauled
''
to
market
along
with
his
own
whiskery
crop
.
###
And
he
nearly
always
bought
and
sold
for
cash
.
###
Along
the
way
,
Mr.
Tharp
omitted
a
total
of
$
1.5
million
from
his
receipts
reported
on
federal
tax
returns
for
three
years
.
###
The
returns
landed
in
the
hands
of
an
Internal
Revenue
Service
criminal
investigator
,
Samuel
James
Baker
.
###
Mr.
Baker
interviewed
or
wrote
to
hundreds
of
catfish
farmers
,
live-haulers
and
processors
throughout
the
South
before
coming
up
with
detailed
estimates
of
purchases
and
sales
,
in
pounds
and
dollars
,
by
Mr.
Tharp
and
others
.
###
Unknown
to
Mr.
Tharp
,
he
had
fouled
his
net
on
a
special
IRS
project
to
catch
catfish
farmers
and
haulers
inclined
to
cheat
on
their
taxes
.
###
Confronted
with
the
evidence
,
Mr.
Tharp
pleaded
guilty
to
one
charge
of
filing
a
false
return
and
was
fined
$
5,000
and
sentenced
to
18
months
in
prison
.
###
He
also
owes
a
lot
of
back
taxes
,
interest
and
civil
fraud
penalties
.
###
A
lot
of
taxpayers
out
there
are
n't
as
paranoid
as
one
might
think
.
###
Federal
and
state
tax
enforcers
develop
many
group
targets
for
investigation
,
on
the
basis
of
occupation
,
high
income
,
type
of
income
,
or
some
other
characteristic
that
may
signal
an
opportunity
or
tendency
to
hide
income
or
exaggerate
deductions
.
###
Many
professions
long
have
seemed
to
be
targets
because
of
the
exotic
or
ludicrous
efforts
of
some
members
to
offset
high
income
with
fake
losses
from
phony
tax
shelters
:
dentists
who
invested
in
dubiously
dubbed
foreign
films
or
airline
pilots
who
raised
racehorses
on
their
days
off
.
###
Mail-order
ministers
have
been
squelched
.
###
Now
,
television
and
radio
evangelists
are
under
scrutiny
.
###
The
IRS
recently
won
part
of
its
long-running
battle
with
the
Church
of
Scientology
over
exemptions
when
the
U.S.
Supreme
Court
held
that
members
'
payments
to
the
church
were
n't
deductible
because
the
members
received
services
in
return
.
###
IRS
statistics
show
that
the
more
persistent
hiders
of
income
among
sole
proprietors
of
businesses
include
used-car
dealers
,
entertainment
producers
,
masons
,
roofers
,
and
taxi
owners
.
###
Small
businesses
in
general
account
for
almost
40
%
of
unreported
personal
income
,
the
IRS
has
said
.
###
Once
such
abuses
become
so
pervasive
,
the
IRS
builds
another
factor
into
its
secret
computer
formula
for
selecting
returns
for
audit
and
does
n't
need
special
projects
for
them
.
###
San
Franciscans
have
a
much
higher
incidence
of
audits
than
average
because
more
of
them
score
high
under
that
formula
,
not
because
IRS
agents
envy
their
life
styles
.
###
Many
openings
for
mass
cheating
,
such
as
questionable
tax
shelters
and
home
offices
,
have
gaped
so
broadly
that
Congress
has
passed
stringent
laws
to
close
them
.
###
Deductions
of
charitable
gifts
of
highly
valued
art
now
must
be
accompanied
by
appraisals
.
###
And
laws
requiring
the
reporting
of
more
varieties
of
transactions
have
enabled
the
IRS
to
rely
on
computers
to
ferret
out
discrepancies
with
returns
and
to
generate
form-letter
inquiries
to
taxpayers
.
###
Unreported
alimony
income
can
be
spotted
by
computer
because
a
payer
of
alimony
-LRB-
who
gets
a
deduction
-RRB-
must
report
the
former
spouse
's
Social
Security
number
.
###
Passport
applicants
now
must
give
Social
Security
numbers
,
enabling
the
IRS
to
see
whether
Americans
living
abroad
are
filing
required
U.S.
returns
.
###
But
while
IRS
computers
focus
routinely
on
target
groups
like
these
,
the
agency
has
assigned
many
agents
to
special
projects
that
need
more
personal
attention
.
###
In
most
cases
,
the
IRS
says
,
these
projects
are
local
or
regional
,
rather
than
national
,
and
arise
because
auditors
in
an
area
detect
some
pattern
of
abuse
among
,
say
,
factory
workers
claiming
that
having
a
multitude
of
dependents
frees
them
from
tax
withholding
or
yacht
owners
deducting
losses
from
sideline
charter
businesses
.
###
The
national
office
currently
has
21
noncriminal
audit
projects
,
according
to
Marshall
V.
Washburn
,
deputy
assistant
commissioner
for
examination
.
###
Auditors
involved
in
noncriminal
projects
ca
n't
send
anyone
to
jail
,
but
they
can
make
life
miserable
in
other
ways
--
for
one
,
by
imposing
some
of
the
150
different
civil
penalties
for
negligence
,
failure
to
file
a
return
,
and
the
like
.
###
The
targeted
audit
groups
include
direct
sellers
--
people
who
sell
cosmetics
,
housewares
and
other
items
door
to
door
or
at
home
parties
--
and
employers
who
label
workers
as
independent
contractors
instead
of
employees
,
to
avoid
the
employer
share
of
payroll
taxes
.
###
Other
projects
look
for
offenders
among
waiters
who
get
cash
tips
,
people
who
engage
in
large
cash
transactions
,
and
people
whose
returns
show
they
sold
a
home
for
a
profit
without
reinvesting
the
capital
gain
in
another
home
by
the
end
of
the
same
year
;
the
gain
must
be
rolled
over
within
two
years
to
defer
tax
.
###
And
now
that
returns
must
show
dependents
'
Social
Security
numbers
,
the
IRS
wants
to
see
which
dependents
show
up
on
more
than
one
return
--
and
which
dependents
turn
out
to
be
deceased
.
###
Impetus
for
the
direct-seller
project
came
from
a
congressional
hearing
some
years
back
.
###
It
prompted
an
IRS
study
that
found
many
sellers
were
concealing
income
and
treating
large
amounts
of
nondeductible
travel
and
other
personal
expenses
as
business
costs
,
Mr.
Washburn
says
.
###
The
study
provided
criteria
for
singling
out
returns
of
``
potentially
noncompliant
''
taxpayers
who
report
low
income
and
large
expenses
from
a
part-time
business
.
###
The
Tax
Court
recently
denied
business
deductions
by
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Peter
S.
Rubin
of
Cherry
Hill
,
N.J.
,
who
both
were
part-time
distributors
of
Amway
products
in
addition
to
their
regular
jobs
as
sales
people
in
other
fields
.
###
For
1984
,
they
reported
gross
income
of
$
1,647
from
Amway
sales
,
offset
by
expenses
totaling
$
16,746
--
including
car
costs
of
$
6,805
and
travel
and
entertainment
costs
of
$
5,088
.
###
The
Tax
Court
did
n't
believe
that
the
Rubins
,
who
earned
$
65,619
in
their
regular
jobs
,
treated
the
sideline
as
a
real
business
and
derived
``
merely
incidental
elements
of
recreation
and
other
personal
pleasure
and
benefits
''
from
it
.
###
The
Direct
Selling
Association
,
a
trade
group
,
points
out
that
its
members
,
which
include
Amway
Corp.
,
cooperate
with
the
IRS
to
distribute
tax-compliance
material
to
sales
people
and
are
helping
to
prepare
a
public-service
television
program
on
the
subject
.
###
The
independent-contractor
project
,
which
began
in
1988
,
involves
about
350
IRS
agents
.
###
In
the
fiscal
nine
months
ended
June
30
,
reports
Raymond
P.
Keenan
,
assistant
commissioner
for
collection
,
they
examined
about
13,000
employers
,
assessed
more
than
$
67
million
in
delinquent
employment
taxes
,
and
reclassified
about
56,000
workers
as
employees
instead
of
self-employed
contractors
.
###
The
number
of
misclassified
workers
may
be
in
the
millions
,
mostly
paid
by
small
firms
.
###
Many
workers
,
especially
professionals
,
want
to
remain
independent
to
avoid
tax
withholding
and
to
continue
to
deduct
many
expenses
that
employees
ca
n't
.
###
But
many
others
,
who
want
to
qualify
for
employee
benefits
and
unemployment
compensation
,
become
tipsters
for
the
IRS
,
says
Jerry
Lackey
,
who
manages
the
IRS
project
's
force
of
nine
agents
in
north
and
central
Florida
from
Orlando
.
###
Firms
that
are
paying
employment
taxes
also
provide
leads
to
competitors
that
are
n't
,
he
says
.
###
In
his
area
,
Mr.
Lackey
continues
,
the
miscreant
employers
most
commonly
are
in
construction
--
doing
framing
,
drywall
,
masonry
and
similar
work
.
###
But
a
medical
clinic
with
about
20
employees
wrongly
listed
all
of
them
--
including
physicians
and
receptionists
--
as
independent
contractors
.
###
The
IRS
assessed
the
clinic
$
350,000
in
back
payroll
taxes
.
###
It
assessed
nearly
$
500,000
against
a
cruise-ship
company
that
carried
about
100
deckhands
,
cooks
,
bartenders
,
entertainers
and
other
employees
as
self-employed
independents
.
###
Revenue-short
states
also
are
becoming
more
aggressive
pursuers
of
tax
delinquents
,
and
perhaps
none
tracks
them
down
with
more
relish
than
does
New
York
since
it
acquired
an
$
80
million
computer
system
in
1985
.
###
The
state
's
tax
enforcers
have
amassed
data
bases
from
other
New
York
agencies
that
license
or
register
professionals
and
businesses
;
from
exchange
agreements
with
the
IRS
,
24
other
states
,
and
two
Canadian
provinces
,
and
even
from
phonebook
Yellow
Pages
.
###
Thus
armed
for
massive
matching
of
documents
by
computer
,
they
single
out
high-income
groups
,
looking
primarily
for
people
who
have
n't
filed
New
York
income-tax
returns
.
###
The
state
has
combed
through
records
relating
to
architects
,
stockbrokers
,
lawyers
in
the
New
York
City
area
,
construction
workers
from
out
of
the
state
,
and
homeowners
who
claim
to
be
residents
of
other
states
--
especially
Florida
,
which
has
no
personal
income
tax
.
###
Soon
to
feel
the
glare
of
attention
are
lawyers
elsewhere
in
the
state
,
doctors
,
dentists
,
and
accountants
,
says
Frederick
G.
Hicks
,
director
of
the
tax-department
division
that
develops
the
computer-matching
programs
.
###
The
department
has
collected
over
$
6.5
million
from
brokers
so
far
and
recommended
more
than
30
of
them
for
criminal
prosecution
.
###
In
the
early
stage
of
checking
people
with
incomes
exceeding
$
500,000
who
were
filing
nonresident
returns
,
it
squeezed
$
7.5
million
out
of
a
man
who
was
posing
as
a
Florida
resident
.
###
``
We
think
we
can
reclaim
hundreds
of
millions
of
dollars
just
through
the
nonresident
project
,
''
Mr.
Hicks
declares
.
###
Mr.
Schmedel
is
editor
of
The
Wall
Street
Journal
's
Tax
Report
column
.
###
In
finding
``
good
news
''
in
Berkeley
's
new
freshman
admissions
plan
-LRB-
``
The
Privileged
Class
,
''
editorial
,
Sept.
20
-RRB-
,
you
're
reading
the
headline
but
not
the
story
.
###
The
plan
indeed
raises
from
40
%
to
50
%
the
number
of
freshmen
applicants
admitted
strictly
by
academic
criteria
.
###
But
that
does
n't
mean
``
half
of
the
students
attending
Berkeley
''
will
be
admitted
this
way
.
###
The
plan
is
talking
about
applicants
admitted
,
not
students
who
enroll
.
###
Since
the
``
yield
''
from
this
top
slice
of
applicants
is
relatively
low
,
boosting
admits
from
40
%
to
50
%
will
boost
registrants
from
about
31
%
to
38
%
of
the
class
.
###
In
addition
,
perhaps
5
%
of
registrants
will
come
from
a
new
category
consisting
of
applicants
whose
academic
credentials
``
narrowly
missed
''
gaining
them
admission
in
the
first
category
.
###
But
against
that
combined
increase
of
12
%
in
students
chosen
by
academic
criteria
,
the
plan
eliminates
a
large
category
in
which
admissions
now
are
based
on
grades
,
test
scores
and
``
supplemental
points
''
for
factors
such
as
high-school
curriculum
,
English-language
proficiency
and
an
essay
.
###
This
category
now
accounts
for
about
19
%
of
admits
and
22
%
of
registrants
.
###
The
plan
thus
will
decrease
by
22
%
,
for
a
net
loss
of
10
%
,
the
number
of
students
admitted
primarily
by
academic
criteria
.
###
Who
will
take
over
these
places
?
###
The
plan
creates
a
new
category
of
students
from
``
socioeconomically
disadvantaged
backgrounds
,
''
a
concept
not
yet
defined
,
and
gives
about
10
%
of
the
class
.
###
One
of
the
plan
's
authors
has
defended
the
``
socioeconomic
disadvantage
''
category
as
perhaps
making
more
sense
than
the
current
affirmative-action
preferences
based
on
race
.
###
Perhaps
it
does
.
###
But
the
new
category
does
not
replace
or
reduce
Berkeley
's
broad
racial
preferences
.
###
Nor
will
students
from
racial-minority
groups
who
are
admitted
through
the
new
category
be
counted
against
the
affirmative-action
``
target
''
for
their
group
.
###
The
plan
thus
places
a
large
new
affirmative-action
program
,
based
on
``
socioeconomic
disadvantage
,
''
on
top
of
the
existing
program
based
on
race
.
###
The
role
of
academic
criteria
in
choosing
Berkeley
's
freshmen
can
only
decline
as
a
result
.

FOR
THOSE
WHO
DELIGHT
in
the
misfortune
of
others
,
read
on
.
###
This
is
a
story
about
suckers
.
###
Most
of
us
know
a
sucker
.
###
Many
of
us
are
suckers
.
###
But
what
we
may
not
know
is
just
what
makes
somebody
a
sucker
.
###
What
makes
people
blurt
out
their
credit-card
numbers
to
a
caller
they
've
never
heard
of
?
###
Do
they
really
believe
that
the
number
is
just
for
verification
and
is
simply
a
formality
on
the
road
to
being
a
grand-prize
winner
?
###
What
makes
a
person
buy
an
oil
well
from
some
stranger
knocking
on
the
screen
door
?
###
Or
an
interest
in
a
retirement
community
in
Nevada
that
will
knock
your
socks
off
,
once
it
is
built
?
###
Because
in
the
end
,
these
people
always
wind
up
asking
themselves
the
same
question
:
``
How
could
I
be
so
stupid
?
''
###
There
are
,
unfortunately
,
plenty
of
answers
to
that
question
--
and
scam
artists
know
all
of
them
.
###
``
These
people
are
very
skilled
at
finding
out
what
makes
a
person
tick
,
''
says
Kent
Neal
,
chief
of
the
economic-crime
unit
of
the
Broward
County
State
Attorney
's
Office
in
Fort
Lauderdale
,
Fla.
,
a
major
haven
for
boiler
rooms
.
###
``
Once
they
size
them
up
,
then
they
know
what
buttons
to
push
.
###
John
Blodgett
agrees
--
and
he
ought
to
know
.
###
He
used
to
be
a
boiler-room
salesman
,
peddling
investments
in
oil
and
gas
wells
and
rare
coins
.
###
``
There
's
a
definite
psychology
of
the
sale
and
different
personalities
you
pitch
different
ways
,
''
he
says
.
###
The
most
obvious
pitch
,
of
course
,
is
the
lure
of
big
returns
.
###
``
We
're
all
a
little
greedy
.
###
Everyone
is
vulnerable
,
''
says
Charles
Harper
,
associate
regional
administrator
for
the
Securities
and
Exchange
Commission
in
Miami
.
###
``
These
guys
prey
on
human
frailties
.
''
###
While
the
promises
of
big
profits
ought
to
set
off
warning
bells
,
they
often
do
n't
,
in
part
because
get-rich-quick
tales
have
become
embedded
in
American
folklore
.
###
``
The
overnight
success
story
is
part
of
our
culture
,
and
our
society
puts
an
emphasis
on
it
with
lotteries
and
Ed
McMahon
making
millionaires
out
of
people
,
''
says
Michael
Cunningham
,
an
associate
professor
of
psychology
at
the
University
of
Kentucky
in
Louisville
.
###
``
Other
people
are
making
it
overnight
,
and
the
rest
who
toil
daily
do
n't
want
to
miss
that
opportunity
when
it
seems
to
come
along
.
''
###
Adds
Spencer
Barasch
,
branch
chief
for
enforcement
at
the
SEC
in
Fort
Worth
,
Texas
:
``
Why
do
people
play
the
lottery
when
the
odds
are
great
against
them
?
###
People
are
shooting
for
a
dream
.
''
###
Clearly
,
though
,
scam
artists
have
to
be
a
bit
more
subtle
than
simply
promising
millions
;
the
psychology
of
suckers
is
n't
simply
the
psychology
of
the
greedy
.
###
There
's
also
,
for
instance
,
the
need
to
be
part
of
the
in-crowd
.
###
So
one
popular
ploy
is
to
make
a
prospective
investor
feel
like
an
insider
,
joining
an
exclusive
group
that
is
about
to
make
a
killing
.
###
Between
1978
and
1987
,
for
instance
,
SH
Oil
in
Winter
Haven
,
Fla.
,
sold
interests
in
oil
wells
to
a
very
select
group
of
local
residents
,
while
turning
away
numerous
other
eager
investors
.
###
The
owner
of
the
company
,
Stephen
Smith
,
who
has
since
pleaded
guilty
to
state
and
federal
fraud
charges
,
confided
to
investors
that
he
had
a
secret
agreement
with
Amoco
Oil
Co.
and
said
the
location
of
his
wells
was
confidential
,
according
to
a
civil
suit
filed
in
a
Florida
state
court
by
the
Florida
comptroller
's
office
.
###
Neither
the
Amoco
agreement
nor
the
wells
existed
,
the
suit
alleged
.
###
Such
schemes
,
says
Tony
Adamski
,
chief
of
the
financial-crimes
unit
of
the
Federal
Bureau
of
Investigation
in
Washington
,
D.C.
,
appeal
to
investors
'
``
desire
to
believe
this
is
really
true
and
that
they
are
part
of
a
chosen
group
being
given
this
opportunity
.
''
###
At
times
,
salesmen
may
embellish
the
inside
information
with
``
the
notion
that
this
is
some
slightly
shady
,
slightly
illegal
investment
the
person
is
being
included
in
,
''
says
Mr.
Cunningham
.
###
In
appealing
to
those
with
a
bit
of
larceny
in
their
hearts
,
the
fraud
artist
can
insist
that
a
person
keep
an
investment
secret
--
insulating
himself
from
being
discovered
and
keeping
his
victim
from
consulting
with
others
.
###
It
also
adds
to
the
mystery

For
some

it
's
the
appearances
that
leave

deceived

``
The

###
Conservative
appearances
make
people
think
it
's
a
conservative
investment

###
``
People

Paul

Born-again

unscrupulous
do-gooder
investment

Psychologists
say
isolated
people
who
do

at

Scam
artists
seek
out
such
people

or
try
to
make
sure
that
their
victims
isolate
themselves

For
instance
,
salesmen
may
counter
a
man
's
objection
that
he
wants
to
discuss
an
investment
with
his
wife
by
asking
,
``
Who
wears

Or
an

wants
his

FOX
HUNTING
HAS
been
defined
as
the
unspeakable
in
pursuit
of
the
inedible
,
but
at
least
it
's
exercise
.
###
At
least
it
has
a
little
dash
.
###
Most
of
us
have
to
spend
our
time
on
pursuits
that
afford
neither
,
drab
duties
rather
than
pleasures
.
###
Like
trying
to
buy
life
insurance
,
for
instance
,
an
endeavor
notably
lacking
in
dash
.
###
Call
it
the
uninformed
trudging
after
the
incomprehensible
.
###
But
sooner
or
later
,
most
of
us
have
to
think
about
life
insurance
,
just
as
we
often
have
to
think
about
having
root-canal
work
.
###
And
my
time
has
come
.
###
I
'm
33
,
married
,
no
children
,
and
employed
in
writing
stories
like
this
one
.
###
In
times
past
,
life-insurance
salesmen
targeted
heads
of
household
,
meaning
men
,
but
ours
is
a
two-income
family
and
accustomed
to
it
.
###
So
if
anything
happened
to
me
,
I
'd
want
to
leave
behind
enough
so
that
my
33-year-old
husband
would
be
able
to
pay
off
the
mortgage
and
some
other
debts
-LRB-
though
not
,
I
admit
,
enough
to
put
any
potential
second
wife
in
the
lap
of
luxury
-RRB-
.
###
Figuring
that
maybe
$
100,000
to
$
150,000
would
do
but
having
no
idea
of
what
kind
of
policy
I
wanted
,
I
looked
at
the
myriad
products
of
a
dozen
companies
--
and
plunged
into
a
jungle
of
gibberish
.
###
Over
the
past
decade
or
two
,
while
I
was
thinking
about
fox
hunting
,
the
insurance
industry
has
spawned
an
incredible
number
of
products
,
variations
on
products
,
and
variations
on
the
variations
.
###
Besides
term
life
and
whole
life
-LRB-
the
old
standbys
-RRB-
,
we
now
have
universal
life
,
universal
variable
life
,
flexible
adjustable
universal
life
,
policies
with
persistency
bonuses
,
policies
festooned
with
exotic
riders
,
living
benefit
policies
,
and
on
and
on
.
###
What
to
do
?
###
First
,
generalize
.
###
Shorn
of
all
their
riders
,
special
provisions
,
and
other
bells
and
whistles
,
insurance
policies
can
still
be
grouped
under
two
broad
categories
:
so-called
pure
insurance
,
which
amasses
no
cash
value
in
the
policy
and
pays
off
only
upon
death
,
and
permanent
insurance
,
which
provides
not
only
a
death
benefit
but
also
a
cash
value
in
the
policy
that
can
be
used
in
various
ways
while
the
insured
is
still
alive
.
###
If
all
you
want
is
death-benefit
coverage
,
pure
insurance
--
a
term
policy
--
gives
you
maximum
bang
for
your
buck
,
within
limits
.
###
It
's
much
cheaper
than
permanent
insurance
bought
at
the
same
age
.
###
But
``
term
''
means
just
that
;
the
policy
is
written
for
a
specific
time
period
only
and
must
be
renewed
when
it
expires
.
###
It
may
also
stipulate
that
the
insured
must
pass
another
medical
exam
before
renewal
;
if
you
flunk
--
which
means
you
need
insurance
more
than
ever
--
you
may
not
be
able
to
buy
it
.
###
Even
if
you
're
healthy
and
can
renew
,
your
premium
will
go
up
sharply
because
you
're
that
much
older
.
###
So
term
insurance
may
not
be
as
cheap
as
it
looks
.
###
There
are
all
sorts
of
variations
on
term
insurance
:
policies
structured
to
pay
off
your
mortgage
debt
,
term
riders
tacked
on
to
permanent
insurance
,
and
many
others
.
###
One
variation
that
appealed
to
me
at
first
was
the
``
Money
Smart
Term
Life
''
policy
offered
by
Amex
Life
Insurance
Co.
,
the
American
Express
unit
,
to
the
parent
company
's
credit-card
holders
.
###
Upon
examination
,
however
,
I
wondered
whether
the
plan
made
a
lot
of
sense
.
###
Amex
said
it
would
charge
me
$
576
a
year
for
$
100,000
of
coverage
--
and
would
pay
me
back
all
the
premiums
I
put
in
if
I
canceled
the
policy
after
10
years
.
###
Sounds
great
--
or
does
it
?
###
First
,
if
I
canceled
,
I
'd
have
no
more
insurance
,
a
not
insignificant
consideration
.
###
Second
,
the
$
5,760
I
'd
get
back
would
be
much
diminished
in
purchasing
power
by
10
years
of
inflation
;
Amex
,
not
I
,
would
get
the
benefit
of
the
investment
income
on
my
money
,
income
that
would
have
exceeded
the
inflation
rate
and
thus
given
the
company
a
real
profit
.
###
Third
and
most
important
,
Amex
would
charge
me
a
far
higher
premium
than
other
reputable
companies
would
on
a
straight
term
policy
for
the
same
amount
;
I
'd
be
paying
so
heavily
just
to
have
the
option
of
getting
my
premiums
back
that
I
'd
almost
have
to
cancel
to
make
the
whole
thing
worthwhile
.
###
That
would
be
all
right
with
Amex
,
which
could
then
lock
in
its
investment
profit
,
but
it
does
n't
add
up
to
a
``
smart
money
''
move
for
me
.
###
Which
goes
to
show
that
the
First
Law
applies
in
insurance
as
in
anything
else
:
There
is
no
free
lunch
,
there
is
only
marketing
.
###
And
the
Second
Law
,
unique
to
insurance
?
###
If
I
die
early
,
I
win
--
a
hollow
victory
,
since
I
ca
n't
enjoy
it
--
and
if
I
live
long
,
the
insurer
wins
.
###
This
is
worth
remembering
when
insurers
and
their
salesmen
try
to
sell
you
permanent
insurance
,
the
kind
that
amasses
cash
value
.
###
The
word
``
death
''
can
not
be
escaped
entirely
by
the
industry
,
but
salesmen
dodge
it
wherever
possible
or
cloak
it
in
euphemisms
,
preferring
to
talk
about
``
savings
''
and
``
investment
''
instead
.
###
The
implication
is
that
your
permanent-insurance
policy
is
really
some
kind
of
CD
or
mutual-fund
account
with
an
added
feature
.
###
That
is
gilding
the
lily
.
###
The
fact
is
that
as
a
savings
or
investment
vehicle
,
insurance
generally
runs
a
poor
second
to
any
direct
investment
you
might
make
in
the
same
things
the
insurance
company
is
putting
your
money
into
.
###
That
's
because
you
have
to
pay
for
the
insurance
portion
of
the
policy
and
the
effort
required
to
sell
and
service
the
whole
package
.
###
Again
,
no
free
lunch
.
###
This
is
reflected
in
a
built-in
mortality
cost
--
in
effect
,
your
share
of
the
company
's
estimated
liability
in
paying
off
beneficiaries
of
people
who
had
the
effrontery
to
die
while
under
its
protection
.
###
And
in
most
cases
,
a
huge
hunk
of
your
premium
in
the
initial
year
or
two
of
the
the
policy
is
,
in
effect
,
paying
the
salesman
's
commission
as
well
;
investment
returns
on
most
policies
are
actually
negative
for
several
years
,
largely
because
of
this
.
###
So
view
permanent
insurance
for
what
it
is
--
a
compromise
between
pure
insurance
and
direct
investment
.
###
The
simplest
,
most
traditional
form
of
permanent
insurance
is
the
straight
whole
life
policy
.
###
You
pay
a
set
premium
for
a
set
amount
of
coverage
,
the
company
invests
that
premium
in
a
portfolio
of
its
choosing
,
and
your
cash
value
and
dividends
grow
over
the
years
.
###
One
newer
wrinkle
,
so
called
single-premium
life
-LRB-
you
pay
for
the
whole
policy
at
once
-RRB-
,
has
been
immensely
popular
in
recent
years
for
tax
reasons
;
the
insured
could
extract
cash
value
in
the
form
of
policy
``
loans
,
''
and
none
of
the
proceeds
were
taxable
even
though
they
included
gains
on
investment
.
###
Congress
closed
this
loophole
last
year
,
or
thought
it
did
.
###
However
,
Monarch
Capital
Corp.
of
Springfield
,
Mass.
,
has
developed
a
``
combination
plan
''
of
annuity
and
insurance
coverage
that
it
says
does
not
violate
the
new
regulations
and
that
allows
policy
loans
without
tax
consequences
.
###
But
the
percentage
of
your
cash
reserve
that
you
can
borrow
tax-free
is
very
small
.
###
I
'm
not
prepared
in
any
case
to
put
that
much
money
into
a
policy
immediately
,
so
I
look
into
the
broad
category
called
universal
life
.
###
Hugely
popular
,
it
is
far
more
flexible
than
straight
whole
life
.
###
I
can
adjust
the
amount
of
insurance
I
want
against
the
amount
going
into
investment
;
I
can
pay
more
or
less
than
the
so-called
target
premium
in
a
given
year
;
and
I
can
even
skip
payments
if
my
cash
reserves
are
enough
to
cover
the
insurance
portion
of
the
policy
.
###
In
looking
at
these
and
other
policies
,
I
learn
to
ask
pointed
questions
about
some
of
the
assumptions
built
into
``
policy
illustrations
''
--
the
rows
of
numbers
that
show
me
the
buildup
of
my
cash
values
over
the
years
.
###
They
commonly
give
two
scenarios
:
One
is
based
on
interest
rates
that
the
company
guarantees
-LRB-
usually
4
%
to
4.5
%
-RRB-
and
the
other
on
the
rate
it
is
currently
getting
on
investment
,
often
8.5
%
or
more
.
###
Projecting
the
latter
over
several
decades
,
I
find
my
cash
buildup
is
impressive
--
but
can
any
high
interest
rate
prevail
for
that
long
?
###
Not
likely
,
I
think
.
###
Also
,
some
policy
illustrations
assume
that
mortality
costs
will
decline
or
that
I
will
get
some
sort
of
dividend
bonus
after
the
10th
year
.
###
These
are
not
certain
,
either
.
###
Companies
``
are
n't
comfortable
playing
these
games
,
but
they
realize
they
're
under
pressure
to
make
their
policies
look
good
,
''
says
Timothy
Pfiefer
,
an
actuarial
consultant
at
Tillinghast
,
a
unit
of
Towers
Perrin
Co.
,
the
big
New
York
consulting
firm
.
###
Another
factor
to
consider
:
Some
of
the
companies
currently
earning
very
high
yields
are
doing
so
through
substantial
investment
in
junk
bonds
,
and
you
know
how
nervous
the
market
has
been
about
those
lately
.
###
There
are
seemingly
endless
twists
to
universal
life
,
and
it
pays
to
ask
questions
about
all
of
them
.
###
At
a
back-yard
barbecue
,
for
example
,
a
friend
boasts
that
she
'll
only
have
to
pay
premiums
on
her
John
Hancock
policy
for
seven
years
and
that
her
death
benefits
will
then
be
``
guaranteed
.
''
###
I
call
her
agent
,
David
Dominici
.
###
Yes
,
he
says
,
premiums
on
such
variable-rate
coverage
can
be
structured
to
``
vanish
''
after
a
certain
period
--
but
usually
only
if
interest
rates
stay
high
enough
to
generate
sufficient
cash
to
cover
the
annual
cost
of
insurance
protection
.
###
If
interest
rates
plunge
,
the
insurer
may
be
knocking
on
my
door
,
asking
for
steeper
premium
payments
to
maintain
the
same
amount
of
protection
.
###
I
do
n't
like
the
sound
of
that
.
###
Some
insurers
have
also
started
offering
``
persistency
bonuses
,
''
such
as
extra
dividends
or
a
marginally
higher
interest
yield
,
if
the
policy
is
maintained
for
10
years
.
###
But
Glenn
Daily
,
a
New
York-based
financial
consultant
,
warns
that
many
of
these
bonuses
are
``
just
fantasies
,
''
because
most
are
n't
guaranteed
by
the
companies
.
###
And
the
feature
is
so
new
,
he
adds
,
that
no
insurer
has
yet
established
a
track
record
for
actually
making
such
payments
.
###
So-called
living-benefits
provisions
also
merit
a
close
inspection
.
###
Offered
by
insurers
that
include
Security-Connecticut
Life
Insurance
Co.
,
Jackson
National
Life
Insurance
Co.
,
and
National
Travelers
Life
Insurance
Co.
,
these
policy
riders
let
me
tap
a
portion
of
my
death
benefits
while
I
'm
still
alive
.
###
Some
provisions
would
let
me
collect
a
percentage
of
the
policy
's
face
value
to
pay
for
long-term
care
such
as
nursing-home
stays
;
others
would
allow
payments
for
catastrophic
illnesses
and
conditions
such
as
cancer
,
heart
attarcks
,
renal
failure
and
kidney
transplants
.
###
But
the
catastrophic
events
for
which
the
policyholder
can
collect
are
narrowly
defined
,
vary
from
policy
to
policy
,
and
generally
permit
use
of
only
a
small
fraction
of
the
face
amount
of
insurance
.
###
Also
,
financial
planners
advising
on
insurance
say
that
to
their
knowledge
there
has
not
yet
been
a
tax
ruling
exempting
these
advance
payments
from
taxes
.
###
And
considering
the
extra
cost
of
such
provisions
,
some
figure
that
people
interested
in
,
say
,
paying
for
extended
nursing-home
care
would
be
better
off
just
buying
a
separate
policy
that
provides
it
.
###
I
'm
more
favorably
impressed
by
``
no-load
life
,
''
even
though
it
turns
out
to
be
low-load
life
.
###
Insureres
selling
these
policies
market
them
directly
to
the
public
or
otherwise
do
n't
use
commissioned
salesmen
;
there
is
still
a
load
--
annual
administrative
fees
and
initial
``
setup
''
charges
--
but
I
figure
that
the
lack
of
commission
and
of
``
surrender
fees
''
for
dropping
the
policy
early
still
saves
me
a
lot
.
###
I
compared
one
universal
policy
for
$
130,000
face
amount
from
such
an
insurer
,
American
Life
Insurance
Corp.
of
Lincoln
,
Neb.
,
with
a
similar
offering
from
Equitable
Life
Assurance
Society
of
the
U.S.
,
which
operates
through
11,000
commissioned
salesmen
.
###
After
one
year
I
could
walk
away
from
the
Ameritas
policy
with
$
792
,
but
Id
get
only
$
14
from
the
Equitable
.
###
The
difference
is
magnified
by
time
,
too
.
###
At
age
65
,
when
I
'd
stop
paying
premiums
,
the
Ameritas
offering
would
have
a
projected
cash
value
$
14,000
higher
than
the
other
,
even
though
the
Equitable
's
policy
illustration
assumed
a
fractionally
higher
interest
rate
.
###
Did
I
buy
it
?
###
Well
,
not
yet
.
###
I
'm
thinking
about
using
the
$
871
annual
premium
to
finance
a
trip
to
Paris
first
.
###
A
person
can
do
some
heavy
thinking
about
insurance
there
--
and
shop
for
something
more
exciting
while
she
's
doing
it
.
###
Rorer
Group
Inc.
will
report
that
third-quarter
profit
rose
more
than
15
%
from
a
year
earlier
,
though
the
gain
is
wholly
due
to
asset
sales
,
Robert
Cawthorn
,
chairman
,
president
and
chief
executive
officer
,
said
.
###
His
projection
indicates
profit
in
the
latest
quarter
of
more
than
$
17.4
million
,
or
55
cents
a
share
,
compared
with
$
15.2
million
,
or
48
cents
a
share
,
a
year
ago
.
###
Mr.
Cawthorn
said
in
an
interview
that
sales
will
show
an
increase
from
a
year
ago
of
``
somewhat
less
than
10
%
.
''
###
Through
the
first
six
months
of
1989
,
sales
had
grown
about
12
%
from
the
year-earlier
period
.
###
Growth
of
10
%
would
make
sales
for
the
latest
quarter
$
269
million
,
compared
with
$
244.6
million
a
year
ago
.
###
Mr.
Cawthorn
said
the
profit
growth
in
the
latest
quarter
was
due
to
the
sale
of
two
Rorer
drugs
.
###
Asilone
,
an
antacid
,
was
sold
to
Boots
PLC
,
London
.
###
Thrombinar
,
a
drug
used
to
stanch
bleeding
,
was
sold
to
Jones
Medical
Industries
Inc.
,
St.
Louis
.
###
He
said
Rorer
sold
the
drugs
for
``
nice
prices
''
and
will
record
a
combined
,
pretax
gain
on
the
sales
of
$
20
million
.
###
As
the
gain
from
the
sales
indicates
,
operating
profit
was
``
significantly
''
below
the
year-earlier
level
,
Mr.
Cawthorn
said
.
###
Rorer
in
July
had
projected
lower
third-quarter
operating
profit
but
higher
profit
for
all
of
1989
.
###
He
said
the
company
is
still
looking
for
``
a
strong
fourth
quarter
in
all
areas
--
sales
,
operating
income
and
net
income
.
''
###
Mr.
Cawthorn
attributed
the
decline
in
third-quarter
operating
profit
to
the
stronger
dollar
,
which
reduces
the
value
of
overseas
profit
when
it
is
translated
into
dollars
;
to
accelerated
buying
of
Rorer
products
in
the
second
quarter
because
of
a
then-pending
July
1
price
increase
,
and
to
higher
marketing
expenses
for
Rorer
's
Maalox
antacid
,
whose
sales
and
market
share
in
the
U.S.
had
slipped
in
the
first
half
of
1989
.
###
He
said
Rorer
opted
to
sell
Asilone
and
Thrombinar
to
raise
revenue
that
would
``
kick
start
''
its
increased
marketing
efforts
behind
Maalox
,
still
its
top-selling
product
with
about
$
215
million
in
world-wide
sales
in
1988
.
###
``
We
had
underfunded
Maalox
for
a
year
,
''
he
said
,
because
the
company
was
concentrating
on
research
and
development
and
promoting
other
drugs
.
###
He
said
Rorer
will
spend
$
15
million
to
$
20
million
more
on
Maalox
advertising
and
promotion
in
the
second
half
of
1989
than
in
the
year-earlier
period
.
###
A
``
big
chunk
''
of
that
additional
spending
came
in
the
third
quarter
,
he
said
.
###
Hoechst
AG
said
it
will
stop
producing
fertilizer
in
1990
because
of
continued
losses
and
a
bleak
outlook
.
###
The
West
German
chemical
concern
said
it
will
close
the
last
remaining
fertilizer
plant
in
Oberhausen
in
the
fall
of
next
year
.
###
Hoechst
said
the
fertilizer
market
faces
overcapacity
in
Western
Europe
,
rising
imports
from
East
bloc
countries
and
overseas
,
and
declining
demand
.
###
HomeFed
Corp.
said
its
main
subsidiary
,
Home
Federal
Savings
&
Loan
,
converted
from
a
federal
savings
and
loan
to
a
federal
savings
bank
and
changed
its
name
to
HomeFed
Bank
.
###
The
federal
Office
of
Thrift
Supervision
approved
the
conversion
last
Friday
,
HomeFed
said
.
###
The
change
in
charter
does
n't
alter
the
federal
insurance
of
deposits
,
federal
regulatory
powers
or
company
operations
,
a
spokesman
said
.
###
It
was
the
second
anniversary
of
the
1987
crash
,
but
this
time
it
was
different
.
###
Stocks
rallied
on
good
earnings
reports
and
on
data
that
showed
less
inflation
than
expected
.
###
Blue
chips
led
the
march
up
in
heavy
trading
.
###
The
Dow
Jones
Industrial
Average
rose
39.55
points
to
2683.20
.
###
The
30
industrials
led
the
market
higher
from
the
opening
bell
as
foreign
buyers
stepped
in
.
###
By
afternoon
,
the
broader
market
joined
the
advance
in
full
strength
.
###
Standard
&
Poor
's
500-stock
Index
rose
5.37
to
347.13
and
the
Nasdaq
composite
index
jumped
7.52
to
470.80
.
###
New
York
Stock
Exchange
volume
swelled
to
198,120,000
shares
.
###
The
industrials
were
up
about
60
points
in
the
afternoon
,
but
cautious
investors
took
profits
before
the
close
.
###
Traders
said
a
variety
of
factors
triggered
the
rally
.
###
The
consumer
price
index
rose
0.2
%
in
September
,
while
many
economists
were
looking
for
a
0.4
%
increase
.
###
Stock-index
arbitrage
buy
programs
--
in
which
traders
buy
stock
against
offsetting
positions
in
futures
to
lock
in
price
differences
--
helped
the
rally
's
momentum
.
###
The
euphoria
was
such
that
investors
responded
to
good
earnings
reports
of
companies
such
as
American
Express
,
while
ignoring
the
disappointing
profits
of
companies
such
as
Caterpillar
,
analysts
said
.
###
Stock-index
arbitrage
trading
was
a
minor
influence
in
yesterday
's
rally
,
traders
said
.
###
Institutional
buyers
were
the
main
force
pushing
blue
chips
higher
.
###
To
the
amazement
of
some
traders
,
takeover
stocks
were
climbing
again
.
###
Hilton
rose
2
to
100
,
for
example
.
###
Last
Friday
,
takeover
traders
spilled
out
of
Hilton
,
knocking
the
stock
down
21
to
85
.
###
Among
other
stocks
involved
in
restructurings
or
rumored
to
be
so
:
Holiday
Corp.
gained
1
to
73
and
Honeywell
rose
2
to
81
.
###
One
floor
trader
noted
in
astonishment
that
nobody
seemed
to
mind
the
news
that
British
Airways
is
n't
making
a
special
effort
to
revive
the
UAL
buy-out
.
###
The
announcement
of
the
buy-out
's
troubles
triggered
the
market
's
nose
dive
a
week
ago
.
###
Takeover
enthusiasm
may
have
been
renewed
when
an
investor
group
disclosed
yesterday
that
it
had
obtained
all
the
financing
required
to
complete
its
$
1.6
billion
leveraged
buy-out
of
American
Medical
International
.
###
``
That
's
put
some
oomph
back
into
this
market
,
''
said
Peter
VandenBerg
,
a
vice
president
of
equity
trading
at
Shearson
Lehman
Hutton
.
###
But
some
traders
thought
there
was
less
to
the
rally
than
met
the
eye
.
###
``
There
is
no
strength
behind
this
rally
,
''
asserted
Chung
Lew
,
head
trader
at
Kleinwort
Benson
North
America
.
###
``
It
's
traders
squaring
positions
.
###
's
not
good
;
the
market
is
setting
up
for
another
fall
.
''
###
Indeed
,
many
traders
said
that
uncertainty
about
today
's
monthly
expiration
of
stocks-index
futures
and
options
,
and
options
on
individual
stocks
,
prompted
a
lot
of
buying
by
speculative
traders
who
were
unwinding
positions
that
were
bets
on
declining
stock
prices
.
###
The
number
of
outstanding
contracts
in
the
October
Major

Index
jumped
from
5,273
on
Friday
to
9,023
on
Monday
.
###
The
MMI
is
a
20-stock
index
that
mimics
the
Dow
Jones
Industrial

.
###
Outstanding
contracts
are
those
that
remain
to
be
liquidated
.
###
By
Wednesday
,
the
outstanding
October

amounted
to
8,524

representing
about
$
1.13

The

that

sought

The
51-48
roll
call
fell
well
short
of
the

majority
needed

the
Constitution
.
###
The
vote
,
in
which
11
GOP
lawmakers
voted
against
Mr.
Bush
's
position
,
was
a
victory
for
Democratic
leaders

who
opposed
the
amendment
as
an
intrusion
on
the
Bill
of

.
###
``
We
can
support
the
American
flag
without
changing
the
American
Constitution

''
said
Senate
Majority
Leader
George

.

In

defuse
pressure
for
an
amendment
,
Mr.
Mitchell
and
House
Speaker
Thomas
Foley
-LRB-
D.
,
Wash
.
-RRB-
had
arranged
for
lawmakers
to
pass
a
statute
barring
flag
desecration
before
voting
on
the
constitutional
change
.
###
Mr.
Bush
said
he
would
allow
the
bill
to
become
law
without
his
signature
,
because
he
said
only
a
constitutional
amendment
can
protect
the
flag
adequately
.
###
In

,
the
Supreme
Court
threw
out

###
If
you
think
you
have
stress-related
problems
on
the
job
,
there
's
good
news
and
bad
news
.
###
You
're
probably
right
,
and
you
are
n't
alone
.
###
A
new
Gallup
Poll
study
commissioned
by
the
New
York
Business
Group
on
Health
,
found
that
a
full
25
%
of
the
work
force
at
companies
may
suffer
from
anxiety
disorders
or
a
stress-related
illness
,
with
about
13
%
suffering
from
depression
.
###
The
study
surveyed
a
national
group
of
medical
directors
,
personnel
managers
and
employee
assistance
program
directors
about
their
perceptions
of
these
problems
in
their
companies
.
###
It
is
one
of
a
series
of
studies
on
health
commissioned
by
the
New
York
Business
Group
,
a
non-profit
organization
with
about
300
members
.
###
The
stress
study
was
undertaken
because
problems
related
to
stress
``
are
much
more
prevalent
than
they
seem
,
''
said
Leon
J.
Warshaw
,
executive
director
of
the
business
group
.
###
In
presenting
the
study
late
last
week
,
Dr.
Warshaw
estimated
the
cost
of
these
types
of
disorders
to
business
is
substantial
.
###
Occupational
disability
related
to
anxiety
,
depression
and
stress
costs
about
$
8,000
a
case
in
terms
of
worker
's
compensation
.
###
In
terms
of
days
lost
on
the
job
,
the
study
estimated
that
each
affected
employee
loses
about
16
work
days
a
year
because
of
stress
,
anxiety
or
depression
.
###
He
added
that
the
cost
for
stress-related
compensation
claims
is
about
twice
the
average
for
all
injury
claims
.
###
``
We
hope
to
sensitize
employers
''
to
recognize
the
problems
so
they
can
do
something
about
them
,
Dr.
Warshaw
said
.
###
Early
intervention
into
these
types
of
problems
can
apparently
save
businesses
long-term
expense
associated
with
hospitalization
,
which
sometimes
results
when
these
problems
go
untreated
for
too
long
.
###
Even
the
courts
are
beginning
to
recognize
the
link
between
jobs
and
stress-related
disorders
in
compensation
cases
,
according
to
a
survey
by
the
National
Council
on
Compensation
Insurance
.
###
But
although
56
%
of
the
respondents
in
the
study
indicated
that
mental-health
problems
were
fairly
pervasive
in
the
workplace
,
there
is
still
a
social
stigma
associated
with
people
seeking
help
.
###
The
disorders
,
which
20
years
ago
struck
middle-age
and
older
people
,
``
now
strike
people
at
the
height
of
productivity
,
''
says
Robert
M.A.
Hirschfeld
,
of
the
National
Institute
of
Mental
Health
,
who
spoke
at
the
presentation
of
the
study
's
findings
.
###
The
poll
showed
that
company
size
had
a
bearing
on
a
manager
's
view
of
the
problem
,
with
65
%
of
those
in
companies
of
more
than
15,000
employees
saying
stress-related
problems
were
``
fairly
pervasive
''
and
55
%
of
those
in
companies
with
fewer
than
4,000
employees
agreeing
.
###
The
poll
also
noted
fear
of
a
takeover
as
a
stress-producing
event
in
larger
companies
.
###
More
than
eight
in
10
respondents
reported
such
a
stress-provoking
situation
in
their
company
.
###
Mid-sized
companies
were
most
affected
by
talk
of
layoffs
or
plant
closings
.
###
The
study
,
which
received
funding
from
Upjohn
Co.
,
which
makes
several
drugs
to
treat
stress-related
illnesses
,
also
found
47
%
of
the
managers
said
stress
,
anxiety
and
depression
contribute
to
decreased
production
.
###
Alcohol
and
substance
abuse
as
a
result
of
stress-related
problems
was
cited
by
30
%
of
those
polled
.
###
Although
Dr.
Warshaw
points
out
that
stress
and
anxiety
have
their
positive
uses
,
``
stress
perceived
to
be
threatening
implies
a
component
of
fear
and
anxiety
that
may
contribute
to
burnout
.
''
###
He
also
noted
that
various
work
environments
,
such
as
night
work
,
have
their
own
``
stressors
.
''
###
``
We
all
like
stress
,
but
there
's
a
limit
,
''
says
Paul
D'Arcy
,
of
Rohrer
,
Hibler
&
Replogle
,
a
corporate
psychology
and
management
consulting
firm
.
###
The
problem
,
says
Mr.
D'Arcy
,
a
psychologist
,
is
that
``
it
's
very
hard
to
get
any
hard
measures
on
how
stress
affects
job
performance
.
###

IT
ISN'T
TRUE
that
a
90-year
old
clergyman
on
a
mission
of
mercy
to
a
disaster
area
on
Christmas
Day
can
fly
free
.
###
But
his
circumstances
are
among
the
few
that
can
qualify
for
the
handful
of
really
cheap
airline
tickets
remaining
in
America
.
###
In
recent
years
,
carriers
have
become
much
more
picky
about
who
can
fly
on
the
cheap
.
###
But
there
still
are
a
few
ways
today
's
traveler
can
qualify
under
the
airline
's
many
restrictions
.
###
One
of
the
best
deals
,
though
,
may
mean
skipping
Christmas
dinner
with
the
relatives
.
###
This
week
,
many
carriers
are
announcing
cut-rate
fares
designed
to
get
people
to
fly
on
some
of
the
most
hallowed
--
and
slowest
--
days
of
the
year
,
including
Christmas
.
###
In
recent
years
,
the
airlines
had
waited
until
the
last
moment
to
court
Christmas
season
vacationers
with
bargain
fares
.
###
That
approach
flopped
:
Last
Christmas
Day
,
a
USAir
Group
Inc.
DC-9
jetliner
flew
about
seven
passengers
from
Chicago
to
Pittsburgh
.
###
So
this
year
,
the
airlines
are
getting
a
jump
on
holiday
discounts
.
###
They
are
cutting
ticket
prices
by
as
much
as
70
%
from
normal
levels
for
travel
to
most
U.S.
locations
on
Dec.
24
,
25
,
29
,
30
and
31
,
and
Jan.
4
,
5
and
6
.
###
The
promotions
--
dubbed
everything
from
'T-
is
the
Season
to
be
Jolly
to
Kringle
fares
--
put
round-trip
fares
at
$
98
,
$
148
and
$
198
.
###
``
They
're
trying
to
keep
planes
flying
on
days
they
'd
normally
park
them
,
''
says
Roger
Bard
,
president
of
Mr.
Mitchell
Travel
Service
in
Burnsville
,
N.C
.
###
Expect
,
of
course
,
sky-high
prices
on
other
dates
near
the
holidays
when
the
airlines
know
vacationers
are
eager
to
travel
.
###
Consider
Adopting
Your

's
Name
###
IF
CONTINENTAL
Airlines
has
its
way
,
couples
like
Marlo
Thomas
and
Phil
Donahue
may
find
it
a
hassle
to
qualify
for
some
new
discounts
.
###
Continental
,
a
Texas
Air
Corp.
unit
,
recently
unveiled
a
marketing
program
offering
free
companion
tickets
to
business-class
and
first-class
passengers
on
international
flights
.
###
The
Continental
catch
:
Only
immediate
family
members
are
allowed
,
and
they
must
have
the
same
last
name
as
the
buyer
of
the
ticket
or
legal
proof
they
're
related
.
###
That
irritates
many
women
who
have
n't
taken
their
husbands
'
last
name
.
###
``
What
a
bunch
of
nonsense

''
says
Jessica
Crosby
,
president

New

chapter
of
the
National
Association
of
Women
Business
Owners
.
###
``
This
sets
things
way
back
.
''
###
Continental
's
logic
:
It
does
n't
want
business
companions
abusing
the
promotion
by
falsely
claiming
to
be
related
.
###
``
We
accommodate
their
choice
of
names
by
allowing
them
to
demonstrate
''
family
affiliation
with
legal
documents
,
says
Jim
O'Donnell
,
a
senior
vice
president
.
###
But
gay
rights
advocates
are
angry
,
too
.
###
The
Lambda
Legal
Defense
and
Education
Fund
of
New
York
City
has
received
complaints
from
homosexual
couples
whom
the
airline
does
n't
recognize
as
family
.
###
``
It
's
certainly
discrimination
,
''
says
attorney
Evan
Wolfson
,
whose
group
forced
Trans
World
Airlines
this
year
to
change
a
rule
that
allowed
travelers
to
transfer
frequent
flier
awards
only
to
family
members
.
###
Take

In
a
Hurricane
Area
WHEN
HURRICANE
Hugo
careened
through
the
Caribbean
and
the
Atlantic
coast
states
,
it
downed
electric
and
telephone
lines
,
shot
coconuts
through
cottage
rooftops
,
shattered
windows
and
uprooted
thousands
of
lives
.
###
It
also
lowered
some
air
fares
.
###
Since
the
hurricane
,
Midway
Airlines
Inc.
and
American
Airlines
,
a
unit
of
AMR
Corp.
,
trimmed
their
one-way
fares

to
$
109
from
prices
that
were
at
times
double
that

Just

SENIOR
CITIZENS
have
long
received
cheap

###
This
year
,
the
older
someone
is
the
bigger
the
discount
.

A
senior

between
62

saves
70

off
regular

Travelers
up

And
centenarians

Next

Northwest

There
's
even
a
special
fare
for
clergy
that
does

require

That

The
British
Petroleum
Co.
PLC
said
its
BP
Exploration
unit
has
produced
the
first
oil
from
its
Don
oilfield
in
the
North
Sea
.
###
In
an
official
release
,
BP
said
initial
production
from
the
field
was
11,000
barrels
a
day
,
and
that
it
expects
peak
output
from
the
field
of
15,000
barrels
a
day
to
be
reached
in
1990
.

As
the
sponsor
of
the
``
Older
Americans
Freedom
to
Work
Act
,
''
which
would
repeal
the
Social
Security
earnings
limit
for
people
aged
65
and
older
,
I
applaud
your
strong
endorsement
to
repeal
this
Depression-era
fossil
.
###
For
every
dollar
earned
over
$
8,880
,
Social
Security
recipients
lose
50
cents
of
their
Social
Security
benefits
;
it
's
like
a
50
%
marginal
tax
.
###
But
the
compounded
effects
of
``
seniors
only
''
taxes
result
in
truly
catastrophic
marginal
tax
rates
.
###
Imagine
a
widow
who
wants
to
maintain
her
standard
of
living
at
the
same
level
she
had
before
she
had
to
pay
the
catastrophic
surtax
.
###
Although
this
widow
earns
only
twice
the
minimum
wage
,
largely
due
to
the
earnings
limit
,
she
would
have
to
earn
an
additional
$
4,930
to
offset
her
catastrophic
surtax
of
$
496
.
###
Eliminating
the
earnings
limit
would
greatly
help
seniors
and
reduce
the
deficit
.
###
Repeal
would
generate
more
in
new
taxes
than
the
government
would
lose
in
increased
Social
Security
benefit
payments
.
###
We
now
need
support
from
the
Democrats
on
the
Rules
Committee
in
order
to
include
earnings-limit
reform
in
the
Reconciliation
Bill
.
###
Since
all
four
Republicans
on
the
committee
are
co-sponsors
of
my
bill
,
it
is
the
Democrats
who
will
be
held
fully
accountable
if
an
earnings
test
amendment
is
not
allowed
from
the
floor
.
###
The
time
is
now
to
lift
the
burdensome
Social
Security
earnings
limit
from
the
backs
of
our
nation
's
seniors
.

When
his
Seventh
Avenue
fur
business
here
was
flying
high
20
years
ago
,
Jack
Purnick
had
25
workers
and
a
large
factory
.
###
Now
his
half-dozen
employees
work
in
an
eighth-floor
shop
that
he
says
is
smaller
than
his
old
storage
room
.
###
He
also
says
he
is
losing
money
now
.
###
He
blames
imports
.
###
But
just
down
Seventh
Avenue
,
where
about
75
%
of
U.S.
fur
garments
are
made
,
Larry
Rosen
has
acquired
two
retail
outlets
,
broadened
his
fur-making
line
and
expanded
into
leather
.
###
He
credits
imports
.
###
The
difference
lies
in
how
the
two
entrepreneurial
furriers
reacted
to
the
foreign
competition
and
transformation
of
their
industry
over
the
past
10
years
.
###
One
stuck
to
old-line
business
traditions
,
while
the
other
embraced
the
change
.
###
``
The
small
,
good
fur
salon
is
not
what
it
used
to
be
,
''
says
Mr.
Purnick
,
75
years
old
.
###
``
We
make
the
finest
product
in
the
world
,
and
the
Americans
are
being
kicked
around
.
''
###
Mr.
Rosen
,
though
,
believes
imports
have
reinvigorated
the
industry
in
which
he
has
worked
for
most
of
his
57
years
.
###
``
You
've
got
some
minds
here
that
wo
n't
think
progressively
,
''
he
says
.
###
Import
competition
for
U.S.
furs
has
risen
sharply
since
furriers
started
aggressively
marketing
``
working-girl
mink
''
and
similar
lower-priced
imported
furs
in
recent
years
.
###
Merchants
discovered
a
consumer
largely
ignored
by
higher-priced
furriers
:
the
younger
woman
--
even
in
her
late
20s
--
who
never
thought
she
could
buy
a
mink
.
###
The
new
market
helped
boost
U.S.
fur
sales
to
about
$
1.8
billion
a
year
now
,
triple
the
level
in
the
late
1970s
.
###
It
also
opened
the
door
to
furs
made
in
South
Korea
,
China
,
Hong
Kong
and
other
countries
.
###
Jindo
Furs
,
a
large
South
Korean
maker
,
says
it
operates
35
retail
outlets
in
the
U.S.
and
plans
to
open
15
more
by
the
end
of
next
year
.
###
Mr.
Purnick
and
other
old-line
furriers
call
many
of
the
the
imports
unstylish
and
poorly
made
.
###
High-end
U.S.
furriers
say
these
imports
have
n't
squeezed
them
.
###
But
low-priced
and
middle-priced
furriers
like
Mr.
Purnick
,
who
once
saturated
the
five-block
Seventh
Avenue
fur
district
,
say
imports
have
cut
their
sales
.
###
A
woman
who
once
would
have
saved
for
two
or
three
seasons
to
buy
a
U.S.-made
mink
can
now
get
an
imported
mink
right
away
for
less
than
$
2,000
.
###
Yet
Mr.
Rosen
has
turned
the
import
phenomenon
to
his
advantage
.
###
Early
in
the
decade
he
saw
that
fur
workers
in
many
foreign
countries
were
willing
to
work
longer
hours
at
lower
wages
than
their
American
counterparts
and
were
more
open
to
innovation
.
###
In
1982
,
he
started
a
factory
in
Greece
.
###
Two
years
later
,
he
opened
one
in
West
Germany
.
###
He
also
noticed
that
foreign
makers
were
introducing
many
variations
on
the
traditional
fur
,
and
he
decided
to
follow
suit
.
###
By
combining
his
strengths
in
innovation
and
quality
control
with
the
lower
costs
of
production
abroad
,
he
says
he
has
been
able
to
produce
high-quality
goods
at
low
cost
.
###
To
maintain
control
over
production
and
avoid
overdependence
on
foreign
sources
,
he
says
he
still
makes
most
of
his
furs
in
the
U.S
.
###
But
six
years
ago
he
also
began
importing
from
the
Far
East
.
###
Inspired
by
imports
,
Mr.
Rosen
now
makes
fur
muffs
,
hats
and
flings
.
###
This
year
he
produced
a
men
's
line
and
offers
dyed
furs
in
red
,
cherry
red
,
violet
,
royal
blue
and
forest
green
.
###
He
has
leather
jackets
from
Turkey
that
are
lined
with
eel
skin
and
topped
off
with
raccoon-skin
collars
.
###
From
Asia
,
he
has
mink
jackets
with
floral
patterns
made
by
using
different
colored
furs
.
###
Next
he
will
be
testing
pictured
embroidery
-LRB-
called
kalega
-RRB-
made
in
the
Far
East
.
###
He
plans
to
attach
the
embroidery
to
the
backs
of
mink
coats
and
jackets
.
###
Besides
adding
to
sales
,
leathers
also
attract
retailers
who
may
buy
furs
later
,
he
adds
.
###
Other
furriers
have
also
benefited
from
leathers
.
###
Seymour
Schreibman
,
the
65-year-old
owner
of
Schreibman
Raphael
Furs
Inc.
,
treats
the
reverse
side
of
a
Persian
lambskin
to
produce
a
reversible
fur-and-leather
garment
.
###
He
says
it
accounts
for
25
%
of
total
sales
.
###
Mr.
Rosen
is
also
pushing
retail
sales
.
###
he
bought
two
stores
,
one
in
Brooklyn
and
one
in
Queens
.
###
Other
furriers
have
also
placed
more
weight
on
retailing
.
###
Golden
Feldman
Furs
Inc.
began
retailing
aggressively
eight
years
ago
,
and
now
retail
sales
account
for
about
20
%
of
gross
income
.
###
In
other
moves
,
Mr.
Rosen
says
he
bought
a
truck
three
years
ago
to
reach
more
retailers
.
###
Since
then
he
has
expanded
his
fleet
and
can
now
bring
his
furs
to
the
front
door
of
retailers
as
far
away
as
the
Midwest
.
###
Small
retailers
who
ca
n't
afford
to
travel
to
his
New
York
showroom
have
become
fair
game
.
###
Such
moves
have
helped
Mr.
Rosen
weather
the
industry
slump
of
recent
years
.
###
The
industry
enjoyed
six
prosperous
years
beginning
in
1980
,
but
since
1986
sales
have
languished
at
their
$
1.8
billion
peak
.
###
Large
furriers
such
as
Antonovich
Inc.
,
Fur
Vault
Inc.
and
Evans
Inc.
all
reported
losses
in
their
latest
fiscal
years
.
###
Aftereffects
of
the
1987
stock
market
crash
head
the
list
of
reasons
.
###
In
addition
,
competition
has
glutted
the
market
with
both
skins
and
coats
,
driving
prices
down
.
###
The
animal-rights
movement
has
n't
helped
sales
.
###
Warm
winters
over
the
past
two
years
have
trimmed
demand
,
too
,
furriers
complain
.
###
And
those
who
did
n't
move
some
production
overseas
suffer
labor
shortages
.
###
``
The
intensive
labor
needed
to
manufacture
furs
-LCB-
in
the
U.S
.
-RCB-
is
not
as
available
as
it
was
,
''
says
Mr.
Schreibman
,
who
is
starting
overseas
production
.
###
But
even
those
who
have
found
a
way
to
cope
with
the
imports
and
the
slump
,
fear
that
furs
are
losing
part
of
their
allure
.
###
``
People
are
promoting
furs
in
various
ways
and
taking
the
glamour
out
of
the
fur
business
,
''
says
Stephen
Sanders
,
divisional
merchandise
manager
for
Marshall
Field
's
department
store
in
Chicago
.
###
``
You
ca
n't
make
a
commodity
out
of
a
luxury
,
''
insists
Mr.
Purnick
,
the
New
York
furrier
.
###
He
contends
that
chasing
consumers
with
low-priced
imports
will
harm
the
industry
in
the
long
run
by
reducing
the
prestige
of
furs
.
###
But
Mr.
Rosen
responds
:
``
Whatever
people
want
to
buy
,
I
'll
sell
.
###
The
name
of
the
game
is
to
move
goods
.
###
Four
workers
at
GTE
Corp.
's
headquarters
have
been
diagnosed
as
having
hepatitis
,
and
city
health
officials
are
investigating
whether
a
cafeteria
worker
may
have
exposed
hundreds
of
other
GTE
employees
to
the
viral
infection
,
company
and
city
officials
said
.
###
The
four
cases
were
all
reported
to
GTE
's
medical
director
and
state
and
local
health
authorities
.
###
GTE
shut
down
its
cafeteria
Tuesday
afternoon
after
testing
determined
that
at
least
one
cafeteria
worker
employed
by
GTE
's
private
food
vending
contractor
,
ARA
Services
Inc.
,
was
suffering
from
a
strain
of
the
virus
,
officials
said
.
###
More
than
700
people
work
in
the
GTE
building
.
###
The
cafeteria
remains
closed
.
###
Dr.
Andrew
McBride
,
city
health
director
,
said
his
staff
suspects
the
hepatitis
,
which
can
be
highly
contagious
,
was
spread
by
the
cafeteria
worker
with
the
virus
.
###
The
exact
strain
of
hepatitis
that
the
cafeteria
worker
contracted
has
n't
been
determined
but
should
be
known
by
the
end
of
the
week
,
Dr.
McBride
said
.
###
Hepatitis
A
,
considered
the
least
dangerous
strain
of
the
virus
,
has
been
confirmed
in
at
least
one
GTE
employee
,
company
and
city
officials
said
.
###
``
From
a
public
health
point
of
view
we
're
relieved
because
hepatitis
A
is
rarely
life-threatening
,
''
said
Dr.
Frank
Provato
,
GTE
's
medical
director
.
###
``
It
's
a
double-edged
sword
though
,
because
it
is
also
the
most
contagious
kind
of
hepatitis
.
''
###
GTE
officials
began
posting
warning
notices
about
the
potential
threat
to
exposure
Wednesday
morning
at
various
places
at
the
company

GTE
spokesman
Thomas
Mattausch
